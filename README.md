# Blog

This is my blog. It used to run on Jekyll but as of October 2022 it runs on Hugo.

For now I am using the [maverick theme](https://github.com/canhtran/maverick) because:
1. It is similar to the Jekyll theme I was using. 
2. It was the most recently updated blog starter on [jamstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/maverick/)

If you like the colour scheme, I found it on [randomal.ly]() (where many more accessible colour themes are waiting for you). If you prefer a light theme to a dark one, that's coming in a future build!

There are some features of the old Jekyll version that won't be here to begin with, but I am determined to implement them in Hugo. These are (among others that I will add as I realise):
1. Nice links between one post and the next/previous in the sequence (Yes, I'd like you to stay.... Keep reading my friend!)
2. Related posts - but maybe in a less hacky way than I did previously? (See [this post](https://mattischrome.com/sprucing-up-the-blog) for the Jekyll implementation, standing on the shoulders of giants and all that...)
3. Some sort of NPM version of my beloved rakefile

It is deployed on Netlify.

Obviously, as soon as someone writes an SSG in Rust, I'll go over to that. (Well, there's already [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) which has Netlify CI support ðŸ¤”)
