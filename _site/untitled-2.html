I mentioned in that post that I’d abandoned it because there was another idea that I wanted to pursue. The working title for it is “Untitled 2”. (It isn’t really, I have an actual working title that would give things away or would at least make me feel like the idea was out in the world.)</p><p>In recent days I’ve mulled over various post ideas and one idea was to write a big reveal of my vision for “Untitled 2”. I could set out what the novel would be about, the ideas it would grapple with, and when and where it would be set. Stuff like that.</p><p>But I realised that just as with <a href="/jackson-x/">Jackson X</a> and the Summer of the Space Whale, this would mean letting go of the project entirely - because if I let the cat out of the bag, I won’t be able to write the novel I dream about.</p><p>At the same time, I realised that I wanted to write this post in order to try to set out the idea. It’s hard enough to write a blog regularly as the long gaps between posts here are testament too. I don’t think I could hammer out eight hundred words a day as well. (Though I guess I won’t know unless I try.) And it’s not as if that’s the only difficulty, at least with a blog I can flit from one topic to another. With a novel I’d have to shape it and make it coherent. Lots of editing would be involved. Ugh.</p><p>However, I do need to work through the principal ideas and see whether they’re worth focussing on. I can see the benefits of at least trying to flesh out the ideas. There are aspects of the novel that I don’t feel confident that I can write. As a result it might be useful to resist my urge to tell you what it’s about and focus instead on producing posts to experiment and maybe develop that confidence.</p><p>After all, “Untitled 2” doesn’t have to be a fantastic novel, it just has to be mine. At least now I can sketch out the shape of the piece and try to set myself those confidence boosting tasks.</p><p>Finally, there was a day recently where I did sit and turn “The Summer of the Space Whale” into a more full-blown treatment. It ended up pretty complex. This pleased me because I did worry that it was an over-simple idea and that it couldn’t be written into a “proper novel”. That’s something that’s also been a worry for me when I’ve though about “Untitled 2” but hopefully it will be similarly amenable.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2015-07-20T00:00:00+01:00">July 20, 2015</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/Ideas">Ideas</a>, <a href="/tag/Writing">Writing</a></span><hr/><div class="post-nav"><p> <a href="/first-light-last-light">&#8672;&nbsp;First Light, Last Light</a></p><p> <a href="/understated-classics-31">Understated Classics #31: The White Room by The KLF&nbsp;&#8674;</a></p></div><!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2015-07-20T00:00:00+01:00">July 20, 2015</time> &middot; <a class="post" href="/tag/Ideas">Ideas</a>, <a class="post" href="/tag/Writing">Writing</a></span> --></section></main></body></html>
