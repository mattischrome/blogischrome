The first is that I was introduced to 808 State quite late through a friend’s sister’s cassette copy of The Shamen’s En-Tact (the original version recorded from vinyl that had a thirteen minute version of “Evil Is Eden”) that also had – to fill out the C90 – the full length sweary version of “What Time Is Love?” by The KLF and four tracks: “Cubik”, “Pacific”, “Olympic” (I think…), and “In Yer Face”.</p><p>That early introduction only served to flag up the name and in the days when you had to wait months between album purchases (on cassette!) I didn’t really get any more 808 State until I bought “Lopez” from “Don Solaris” on <em>cassette single</em> mainly because, if I recall correctly, I was mad on The Propellerheads at the time and wanted their remix. I soon came to prefer the languid original though, and eventually, in 1998 I bought the cassette version of their Greatest Hits (at the time) <em>808:88:98</em>. Happy days. An album so good that I tracked down a CD version on eBay a while later.</p><p>So reason number one is that my overall favourite 808 State album is that undoubtedly fan-polarising compilation, chiefly because it’s hooked in to bobbing between home and college (a good hour’s walk) believing that I was the only person of my peer group remotely interested in this music.</p><p>Reason number two is rather more prosaic. I now own five studio albums by 808 State and I really can’t decide which I like best. I also have another compilation – <em>Blueprint</em>, released a few years back – and even that is interesting for its own reasons (but can’t beat the heady A to B rush of <em>808:88:98</em>). In the end I’ve decided on 1993’s <em>Gorgeous</em> because it’s the “one in the middle” and it happens to contain <em>Plan 9</em>, which is my all-time fave 808 State track.</p><p>I’ll spare you a track-by-track trip through the track list but you should there’s some good stuff on here, not least the aforementioned <em>Plan 9</em> (a beautiful lilting guitar riff with an urgent but not over the top bass line), <em>One In Ten</em> (the UB40 collab that references unemployment statistics that I instead collared as my own personal bisexual pride anthem), <em>10x10</em> (the uplifting house anthem that will leave you smiling for days), <em>Moses</em> (featuring Ian McCulloch in the Bernard Sumner role – see <em>EX:EL</em> for more details), and <em>Europa</em> (a beautiful intro with bells and a bizarrely Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman spoofing female vocal). Oh and <em>Contrique</em> samples <em>She’s Lost Control</em> by Joy Division!</p><p>My only issue with the album is a weird quirk of the sequencing. There are fifteen tracks and regular readers will know that I love a short album, so I’d prefer it if <em>Gorgeous</em> ended with the moody drum-centred <em>Colony</em> (a nice eleven tracks if you don’t mind). Instead the remaining four tracks – <em>Timebomb</em>, <em>Stormin’ Norman</em> (How nineties a reference is that!), <em>Sexy Dancer</em>, and <em>Sexy Synthesizer</em> – add pretty much another EP on to the end of the album. It doesn’t help that <em>Stormin’ Norman</em> and <em>Sexy Dancer</em> are actually awful. I quite like <em>Sexy Synthesizer</em> though, it reminds me of <em>Last Train To Trancentral</em> by The KLF and perhaps its pairing with <em>Sexy Dancer</em> has some sort of “Revenge of the Nerds” thing going on.</p><p>Overall though, <em>Gorgeous</em> is a pretty amazing sounding album that has aged well to my ears, only those last two tracks (and possibly the faux saxophone of <em>Black Morpheus</em>) sound vaguely nineties. The rest is finely honed and stylish modern dance music that you really should wrap your ears around some time.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2013-05-23T00:00:00+01:00">May 23, 2013</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/Music">Music</a>, <a href="/tag/808 State">808 State</a>, <a href="/tag/Understated Classics">Understated Classics</a></span><hr/><div class="post-nav"><p> <a href="/lichtenstein-at-tate-modern">&#8672;&nbsp;Lichtenstein At Tate Modern</a></p><p> <a href="/choucair-at-tate-modern">Choucair At Tate Modern&nbsp;&#8674;</a></p></div><!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2013-05-23T00:00:00+01:00">May 23, 2013</time> &middot; <a class="post" href="/tag/Music">Music</a>, <a class="post" href="/tag/808 State">808 State</a>, <a class="post" href="/tag/Understated Classics">Understated Classics</a></span> --></section></main></body></html>
