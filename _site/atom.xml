   <title>Understated Classics #37: Lost Souls by Doves</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-37"/>
   <updated>2019-08-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-37</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Doves are a band from Manchester who traded dance music for rock yet never left their former genre behind. Starting out as Sub Sub, they scored a worldwide hit in 1993 with “Ain’t No Love (Ain’t No Use)”: a timeless dance tune that immediately owns whatever room it plays in. However, subsequent releases by Sub Sub did not catch on and people started to think of the band as a one-hit wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a feeling of stagnation is best purged with reinvention. Often fire plays a role. When forests burn down, new life springs up to replace the old. This premise sustains many ecosystems. There are species of Eucalyptus tree in Australia that depend on fires to grow their next generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire also rejuvenated Doves. In 1996, on the Williams brothers’ birthday, their studio burned down, taking with it most of Sub Sub’s attempts at an album. The band rose again, a phoenix rechristened as Doves - the name a blurring of Old Testament myth and clubland drug lore. Renewed, they doubled down to create their new ‘debut’ album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lost Souls is a warm dark blanket of a record. Ideas and motifs spread through it like blank ink being stirred into clear water. Its songs embrace change while also acknowledging the giddy free-fall that major life events bring. Long songs stretch out while short codas wind in on themselves. There are huge wordless songs and instrumentals crammed with speech and words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lost Souls is an ‘album as a vessel for memories’ kind of affair. This series of understated classics includes quite a few such albums: the album as memory palace where you’ve stashed and stored reams of memory and imagination. With Lost Souls, I did not realise how much was there until I started focusing, perhaps because the music itself is so subtle. Listening again years later I can hear motifs that drove me to my love of bands like Battles. The time in between has given me more experience with which to interpret the music and the emotion that it stirs up. The album doesn’t change, the listener does, but because it was such an amorphous beast to begin with, it rewards these changes in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And listening to Lost Souls was like falling through a trapdoor into the past. It’s the perfect album to listen to on a hot sleepless night, all that detail and all those layers unfold perfectly in the dark. The opening bars of ‘Firesuite’ took me right down into that strange hinterland between wakefulness and sleep, that place that makes and re-makes memories, allowing you to re-live them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, ‘Sea Song’ and ‘Rise’ become a swirl of song and story, articulated in words that cohere and collapse like the sea and waves they describe. But there are also what the younger me would call ‘proper songs’, songs that strive for purpose and aim for your heart strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘The Man Who Told Everything’ alludes to Bowie’s ‘Man Who Sold The World’ but instead of regarding a strange creature with an indifferent eye (Bowie was, after all, looking at himself in the mirror), Doves attempt to build the song from inside the character. They give him the regret of a grifter, a chancer with one last chance. The string section that the song bulds into is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Catch The Sun’ ties a simple lyric about biding one’s time to a massive pop hook, creating something simultaneously deep and pleasurable - philosophical musings hooked up to the pounding driving beat that you’d love to hear in your car on a sunny day. It is perhaps the brightest and clearest moment on the album, a transient moment of warm bliss that eventually goes up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Melody Calls’ echoes early Oasis: odd lyrics crammed into a catchy musical frame, a song that exists because the melody couldn’t be allowed to get away. In the past I thought the more straightforward songs on Lost Souls highlighted a lack of ideas or a lack of conviction in the ideas expressed in the first half of the record. However, I now realise that the album turns on its expression of opposites, that the more straightforward and direct songs act as keys for unlocking the deeper and more free-form moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead single ‘The Cedar Room’ seems a bit of a stretch at seven minutes but Doves give the song plenty of room to open out into a huge wide-screen refrain. Like ‘Catch The Sun’ its relative simplicity provides some breathing space, but also some spine chilling thrills. It’s a great song to see live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lost Souls closes with a startling song called ‘A House’. It knocked my socks off the first time I heard it and has done so ever since. The opening line is ‘it was a day like this when my house burned down’ and the next four minutes tell a story of loss in such a calm and stoic way that the result is (to me) unforgettable. It is one of my go-to songs for when I’m having a shit day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, as with most of the albums I’ve written about in my understated classics series, Lost Souls isn’t actually that understated at all. Filigreed with small but significant musical details and the whorls of difficult emotions, it is an album born out of overcoming trying circumstances. It has a big heart and plenty to say, even if, like a friend who turns up at your door in a time of crisis, it doesn’t have to say that much at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Civ Leaders #2: Alexander of Macedon</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/civ-leaders-2-alexander-of-macedon"/>
   <updated>2019-05-12T17:41:01+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/civ-leaders-2-alexander-of-macedon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alexander of Macedon is available in a base game DLC pack alongside Darius of Persia. He also has his own scenario “The Conquests of Alexander”, which is both fun to play and instructive in how to use the formidable benefits of his bonuses and unique units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civ-ability&quot;&gt;Civ ability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellenistic Fusion&lt;/em&gt; When capturing a city, receive civic boosts for each holy site and theatre square, and tech boosts for each campus and encampment. This means you can grab up to four boosts when capturing cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leader-bonus&quot;&gt;Leader bonus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Macedonian cities experience no war weariness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All military units recover full health when capturing a city with a wonder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grievances against Alexander decay at twice the usual rate (Gathering Storm expansion).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unique-building&quot;&gt;Unique building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Basilikoi Paides&lt;/em&gt; replaces the barracks in the Encampment. Alongside the usual barracks bonus of +1 housing, you get a free promotion for all melee and ranged units built in the city. This bonus also applies to hetairoi. You also get a burst of science when you complete any unit, equal to a quarter of the unit’s cost. This second bonus is really useful in the early game, especially if you’ve built an encampment instead of a campus. Later on, it’s a way of keeping up even after the memory of Alexander’s golden ages of expansion begin to fade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unique-units&quot;&gt;Unique units&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander has two unique units, both of which appear early on in the tech tree. Both are stronger than the units they replace, which places an emphasis on early military expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;hetaroi&lt;/em&gt; is a horseman replacement that receives extra combat strength next to great generals and belongs to the heavy cavalry class, meaning that it upgrades to a knight (horsemen normally upgrade to coursers, or cavalry prior to Gathering Storm). Heavy cavalry also have a stronger promotion tree than light cavalry, which works well if you’ve  built a basilikoi paides because each new unit comes with a free promotion. This means you can add +10 combat strength against fortified defenders for free, which is perfect for cleaning up barbarian camps and far better than any other heavy cavalry (mostly heavy chariots) that might be floating around other civs’ early game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;hypaspist&lt;/em&gt; is a swordsman replacement. It has an additional 50% support bonus that helps it work in tandem with other units (like your hetaroi) and also gains an additional 5 combat strength when fighting in districts. This means that hypaspists are great for attacking and taking cities. Even better they get +10 strength against anti-cavalry units so they can deal with the spearmen that always seem to hang out in barbarian camps and any that the AI builds to try and halt the tide of your hetaroi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;victory-types-and-play-style&quot;&gt;Victory types and play style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this one should be pretty obvious! The abilities of Alexander and his unique units make it essential to focus on early expansion. The easiest way to build cities is to conquer them from other people. The best way to generate science and culture is to capture large enemy cities. The next best way to generate science is to build units in cities with encampments and basilikoi paides. You don’t need more troops because they all got healed when you took that capital with the wonder you wanted to build. No war weariness. In short, everything is gearing you toward an early expansion war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that having three uniques that you can build in the classical era means you are almost certain to get into at least one  golden age. The golden age bonuses can be very powerful (especially early on) and can be used to pivot away from a militaristic approach. But in all honesty, rampaging across the map with hypasists, hetairoi, and a stack of great generals is so much fun that it’s hard to see why you would deny yourself the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much point bothering with religion but the God of the Forge pantheon, which lets you build ancient and classical era units 25% faster, is something that will make you feared. Given that basilikoi paides convert production into science, the work ethic religious belief and meeting houses would be a decent basis for your main religion if you are able to nab a great prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible-problems&quot;&gt;Possible problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware of who your neighbours are and choose carefully who to pick a fight with. Against some civs your bonuses will merely equalise your troops to those that others have: America on their home continent, Rome’s legions, Gorgo’s hoplites, Gilgamesh’s war carts, Scythia’s cavalry, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t miss your moment. The unique units and the additional strengths they confer on your army are time limited. Other neighbouring civs may have better units later and you’ll be playing as a vanilla civ with outdated bonuses. Failure to expand at the right time will mean you’re playing catch up for the rest of the game. (It’s not all bad though, late on in the game you’re more likely to  capture cities with the districts you need in order to receive multiple tech and civic boosts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of the unique units need more production compared to counterparts belonging to other civs. If your capital ends up being low on production, this could hinder you. However, if you have a basilikoi paides some of that production gets converted into science when you build more units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are playing alone, be aware that the AI  sometimes settles cities in poor positions. This can leave you with a stack of cities in places that you may not have chosen for yourself. In theory if you can get to a classical era monumentality golden age (see earlier notes on likelihood of golden ages), you could purchase cheap settlers with faith and take them along while razing the AI’s cities (you get the Hellenistic Fusion boosts when you capture the city irrespective of what you then choose to do with it). However, you’d need a way of generating lots of faith (maybe you spawned next to a wonder?) and you’d lose many turns getting your new cities up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-gathering-storm-ability&quot;&gt;New gathering storm ability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faster grievance decay. This will help the world to forget your warmongering as you try to cope with becoming a vanilla civ with no bonus units to get you out of a hole when you’re facing down a dark age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-expect-if-youre-playing-against-an-ai-alexander&quot;&gt;What to expect if you’re playing against an AI Alexander&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s going to declare war on you sooner or later. He doesn’t like you if you’re not at war with your neighbours. He might be a pretty boy but stay safe: build pikemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re rolling a new game and randomly get Alexander as your leader, you should aim to get two or three cities with basilikoi paides in them and a large army built as quickly as possible. After that you can have fun steamrollering as many neighbouring civs as you can in order to build a big empire. When your warmongering days are over the double rate of grievance decay will help you get along with your new neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also play the Conquests of Alexander scenario, it’s brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Civ Leaders #1: Hojo Tokimune of Japan</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/civ-leaders-1-hojo-tokimune-of-japan"/>
   <updated>2019-05-06T20:14:48+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/civ-leaders-1-hojo-tokimune-of-japan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;civ-ability&quot;&gt;Civ ability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meiji Restoration&lt;/em&gt; Districts receive a +1 adjacency bonus for each adjacent district, instead of +0.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leader-bonus&quot;&gt;Leader bonus:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Land units in Coastal tiles and naval units in Coast tiles receive +5 Combat Strength.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;+50% Production towards Encampment, Holy Site and Theatre Square districts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units are immune to Hurricane damage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Civilisations at war with Japan receive +100% unit damage from hurricanes while in Japanese territory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unique-unit&quot;&gt;Unique unit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;samurai&lt;/em&gt;, a high combat strength unit that does not lose combat strength when damage and gains an extra 10 combat strength against anti-cavalry units. They are cheap to build and combine well with early support units, which makes them good for capturing cities. Unfortunately the samurai is stuck in Military Tactics, which is a weird dead end in the tech tree that I often skip over, in most of my games as Japan I forgot to build a samurai before they went out of date 🙃.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unique-building&quot;&gt;Unique building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Electronics Factory&lt;/em&gt; replaces the Factory in the Industrial Zone. It provides a culture bonus (+4) after researching Electricity. This provides an extra culture boost later on in the game. Note that while the Electronics Factory provides production to other cities within six tiles like a standard factory, the additional culture after discovering Electricity only goes to the city that builds it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;victory-types-and-play-style&quot;&gt;Victory types and play style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you can build encampments, holy sites and theatre squares quickly, Japan has great potential for domination, religious and cultural victories. If you can grab a religion and pick the belief that allows you to produce faith and culture with holy site buildings, you can become a cultural powerhouse early on in the game. Similarly the Jesuit Education belief can be used to convert faith into cultural and scientific buildings later on in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t stop there. Meiji restoration is an incredible bonus too. It makes the other victory types possible too. Diplomatic victories often depend on the envoys and governors you pick up in the civics tree; with a large cultural output you can establish suzerainty of enough city states to increase your diplomatic favour. Your military bonuses can help you defend and, if necessary, liberate city state allies. High production of faith can make it easier to perform the religious conversion missions city states often give you throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also go for science in a big way. A strong culture game often means a strong spy game for tech boosts, and strong religious output combined with the Jesuit Education beliefs and the Wat religious building means you can quickly catch up if you’re building campuses later on in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally you can hold out for a score victory. Because you should be able to place districts with good adjacency bonuses in new and old cities alike, you can keep powering along and thwarting the AI’s attempts to win by other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible-problems&quot;&gt;Possible problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will suck if you don’t get to found your own religion. When I play against random leaders with Hojo, the computer tends to pick strong faith opponents. I tend to assume that I need to get a religion founded quickly and default to doing so unless another opportunity presents itself. (For example, if I spawn next to the Kumasi  city state I am going to emphasis becoming their suzerain and getting a stack of trade routes online.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once or twice I’ve found that focussing on the Meiji restoration ability can leave me short of troops! I’ll start dropping map tacks everywhere and planning the perfect configuration of districts. And then AI will realise I have two slingers, a warrior and a scout, declare a surprise war and clean me out with a few swordsmen and horsemen. It’s just not cool to watch that +8 commercial hub get stomped by enemy troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-gathering-storm-ability&quot;&gt;New gathering storm ability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gathering Storm expansion added natural disasters and so Hojo gets an additional ability/bonus. All Japanese units are immune to hurricane damage, while units from civilisations at war with Japan receive 100% damage from hurricanes in Japanese territory. This sounds pretty cool but it’s not something that you as a player have any control over, so it is unlikely to prove decisive in a game even if you set disasters to max.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-expect-if-youre-playing-against-an-ai-hojo&quot;&gt;What to expect if you’re playing against an AI Hojo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t played against an AI Japan in recent games. I often turn off religious victory in both my solo games and when I play multiplayer with Ingrid. This might alter the choice of civilisations and leaders that get ‘randomly’ selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Rise and Fall expansion, I remember several games where Japan would forward settle me quite aggressively. However, I don’t remember this happening since the loyalty mechanics were introduced (some civs still do). These days Hojo tends to turtle in games, though you do get the occasional flood of missionaries and apostles. If you have a religion and you’re on his border, it might be good to have an inquisition and buy a few apostles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite cheap encampments Hojo is not a warmonger, though he will chastise you if you don’t have many troops. Perhaps this tendency was added to make the AI avoid the noodling focus on adjacency bonuses that sometimes beset me when I played as Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re rolling a new game and randomly get Hojo as your leader, you should be ok. His bonuses and abilities are quite nice, especially as they are effective across the whole time span of the game. Many civs have bonuses that are tied to a specific era, not so Japan. You have to be careful not to miss the opportunity to build samurais, but otherwise a pretty strong and solid Civ.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>About the Album Digest</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/about-the-album-digest"/>
   <updated>2019-04-30T21:13:37+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/about-the-album-digest</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven’t written one of my monthly album digests for over a year. The reasons mostly boil down to a lack of time and motivation but other factors include the changing way in which I listen to music. I bought more albums on vinyl and only a small proportion of those were recently released music. Meanwhile, the attractions of Spotify’s release radar proved too great to resist: it is a very convenient way to consume new music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is very important for understanding and critiquing new music. You don’t have to be good at writing reviews for this to be true. Opinions should be a dialogue: if you hate something, you should give yourself some time to appreciate it more. Or at least figure out why you hate it and then justify those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we live in fast-moving times: a lot of new albums are being made. For better or ill, the internet makes us aware of new subcultures and forms of expression, more so than ever before. Responding to this ever-growing collection of genres and micro-genres is a full-time endeavour. As a hobbyist it’s hard to keep up, even if you have the benefit of doing it just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the troubles in the world it is harder to do things for fun. There’s almost a sense of duty to get things right, to not make mistakes. That sounds like self-importance but I think it’s the shadow of the world as it is. The problem is not that everyone is watching, more that someone might be. It’s been a good experience to get better at writing about music but I miss the freedom of being able to charge into writing a load of old tosh about this or that album. Now I’m not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more than that, I am sure I am repeating myself. Perhaps a textual analysis of my reviews is in order. I tend to describe riffs and beats and guitars in the same ways all the time (coruscating anyone?). Because text analysis interests me and I’m keen to experiment with these techniques, a post investigating word use in my music reviews will appear soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d be lying if I didn’t acknowledge that sites like Pitchfork aren’t a major inspiration for my music writing. Often their review will help me make sense of a record as I listen to it and it feels a little shabby to be echoing their reviews a lot of the time. Or worse still, to have that butt-hurt reaction of “someone told me this would be good and it wasn’t and now I’m upset”. I’ve noticed Pitchfork reviews becoming more about access to bands and artists, with said access informing a fair number of their reviews, and that doesn’t sit right with me either. When I set out to write a review I want to emulate that personal response to music, to be able to say to the reader “this is how this record has helped me to live my life”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop writing is not the solution. Committing to better writing and allowing myself to enjoy it again, that is the way out of the mess. I don’t feel as much need for music to save my life, not as much as I once did. But I do still feel it. There’s still something about the jangle in the new Vampire Weekend songs that sets me tingly. The pleasure of the pressure on your eardrums never goes away. The meaning may change, the stakes also, but the pleasure remains.  And that’s what I will write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think that holding myself to one post a month (with the tacit suggestion of writing such a post &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; month) is counterproductive. Instead I shall take the understated classics approach and write numbered album digests, starting from 57 (as there have been 56 such digests in the past 8 years). I’ll write a digest semi-regularly, approximately one every four to six weeks, depending on time constraints and the number of interesting albums that are released. This will also allow me to plan themed digests or make sure that digests better represent my current interests. I hope this will prove to be an agreeable format.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Isaac Asimov, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-rest-of-the-foundation-trilogy"/>
   <updated>2019-04-28T22:30:15+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-rest-of-the-foundation-trilogy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I managed to read all of the foundation novels since I &lt;a href=&quot;/foundation&quot;&gt;wrote about the first one&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I’ll write about the next two, which covers the original trilogy of ‘novels’ created from the original short stories. I’ve tried to avoid spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foundation-and-empire&quot;&gt;Foundation and Empire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundation and Empire comprises two novella length stories. The first story (“The General”) picks up from shortly after where the last of the five short stories in &lt;a href=&quot;/foundation&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; left off. While the Foundation has expanded its influence by using its monopoly on technology to control trade, the once great Empire begins to notice. One particular person who notices is a brilliant young General who is determined to crush the Foundation and restore the former power of the Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foundation side of the story is told from the point of view of Lathan Devers, sent by the Foundation to infiltrate Riose’s military operation, however things don’t quite go according to plan… except of course they do: the Seldon Plan takes care of events once more. There’s something of a road movie feel to this half of F&amp;amp;E and the writing is again the precise, well-honed text of the first book’s short stories but given freer reign in a longer format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better is the second story (“The Mule”). Up until this point Hari Seldon’s psychohistory has predicted events almost perfectly. But then a chap called the Mule shows up and planets fall under his sway one by one, even as Seldon appears to predict vastly different events. What happens when the Foundation, almost entirely driven by a quasi-religious belief in the Seldon plan, is faced with events completely outside the predictions of the plan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of The Mule then is the search for a Second Foundation, a sister organisation rumoured to exist at ’Star’s End’. It’s no spoiler to say that the Second Foundation is not found in the story, there are far more profound story beats that I could give away. Needless to say, “The Mule” is a fantastic story, perhaps the making of Asimov as a writer, and definitely the making of Foundation as a series. As appealing as the concept is and the descriptions of far-off planets and spacecraft are, it’s the characters driving this story forward that make it special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-foundation&quot;&gt;Second Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Second Foundation”, also comprised of two novella length stories, details two searches for the mythical Second Foundation. This continues the narrative drive of “The Mule” into the third book.  The first search is by The Mule who by the opening of this book has conquered the Foundation. The second story covers another search sometime later by the restored (first) Foundation. (Sorry, that is a bit of a spoiler, but with another four books to follow you knew that would happen didn’t you?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are both enjoyable stories. The Mule is a fine character but once he conquers the Foundation, he ceases to be interesting. This means that “The Search by The Mule” is the less interesting of the two stories: the all-powerful villain needs dispatching for the sake of making the story interesting and getting the Foundation back on track. Fortunately, Asimov learns his lesson and makes sure the Second Foundation plays a perfect game. Of course it’s done tidily, perhaps a little too tidily: a chess match in which the inevitable checkmate can be seen from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Search by The Foundation” on the other hand is amazing. It is the single best story in the first three books (and thus, spoiler alert, in all the books) and I really enjoyed reading it again. These days I’m a fairly slow reader but I read this story, half a paperback, in about an afternoon. I just couldn’t put it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-time&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asimov wrote two sequels to the original trilogy in the 1980s. Because their plots move on important plot points from the original trilogy I will write about them in a separate post. After that there will be another post on the two prequels that Asimov wrote in the 1990s: these detail the events in the life of Hari Seldon prior to “The Psychohistorians”, the story that opens the first Foundation book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>All the Civs</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I love playing Civ VI. It’s a fine game that improves on previous versions, adding many layers and mechanics that mean you can vary your playing style. In fact, with the recent Gathering Storm expansion there’s now an incredible variety of ways to play. The 39 leaders to play with both reflect and provide the game’s increased complexity. Each leader has a slightly different mechanic that influences how you play the game, and of course the leaders you are up against also affect your game play. You can pick leaders to go up against that will make your game easier or harder. Some leaders can even be an existential threat if you spawn near to them and, as I’ve learned the hard way, it’s not always the leaders you expect that cause these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now at the stage in my Civ VI experience where I’m happy to roll the dice and let the computer pick a leader for me. In recent weeks I’ve had some interesting games with random leaders. I have made some notes for a series of posts, with the aim of writing a post about each of the Civ VI leaders. I’m not a great Civ player by any means but my posts will include a few tips you will find helpful. Of course, the great thing about any Civ game (and Civ VI especially) is that it presents so many decisions that involve weighing up opportunity costs. I have a particular set of biases in confronting these, so some of my advice might be “do as I say, not as I do”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I post about one leader a week, that’s almost a year of posts. I’ve also played some mod civs so I could eventually write about those too. Please send me suggestions! Of course, I’m still hoping there will be additional official civs or even another expansion. I think there are still a few mechanics that could be added to the game that would improve it and justify another expansion. I’ll also write about that in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first post will be next week and will feature Hojo Tokimune of Japan. I played a game with him last week and got completely annihilated in the medieval era. Another game I have on the go is working out a bit better so I will get writing as soon as that game is complete!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ambitions Revisited</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/ambitions-revisited"/>
   <updated>2019-04-23T22:14:22+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ambitions-revisited</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012 &lt;a href=&quot;/ambitions&quot;&gt;I wrote a post&lt;/a&gt; listing my ambitions for the future. Well it’s the future now isn’t it? Almost. After all, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-it-take-for-most-of-the-atoms-in-your-body-to-be-replaced-by-others&quot;&gt;I’m a whole new person now&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway it’s probably time to take stock. Have I achieved any of them? Have any of my ambitions changed? What’s replaced the things that I’ve decided not to worry about? What has come after the things I managed to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, here’s my justification for writing the list in the original post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I am feeling a bit down, I like to write down some of my ambitions. As you can see from this list they are mostly pretty humble but they are also a bit cheesy and embarrassing, so I have put them after the fold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the original list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be wholehearted, cheerful, and sincere&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be creative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look at the world and see its many faces, hear its many voices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explore new recipes as often as possible when I cook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to like the taste of tomatoes and cucumbers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be more at ease around people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listen to people and hear what they say&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play my part&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look after someone special&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Become a parent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share my values with others, help those who need it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Break up all the negative things inside me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know what other people want, help them get it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I wake up each morning I would like to remember my dreams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand art more than I do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lose my fear of creepy crawlies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to drive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to write left handed (why not?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit every country in Europe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit the radio telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let go of unnecessary things&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ditch social networks and the rest of the internet as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to appreciate the noise around me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get over my reliance on sugar to improve my mood&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get rid of things I don’t need&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grow the garden&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write people letters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn the differences between species of trees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be flexible and adaptable and positive about the future&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn how to hang a picture on a wall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how have I done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1, 2 and 3. I hope that I am always whole-hearted, cheerful, and sincere. Creativity obviously comes in many forms, but I like to think I continue to explore new ways of doing things. The many many changes in appearance of this blog are a testament to that. I have travelled &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; since 2012, getting most of the way around &lt;a href=&quot;/south-america-trip-part-1/&quot;&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; in 2013/14 and visiting &lt;a href=&quot;/australia-1&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. One of the ambitions that should have been on the original list was to visit Iceland (it’s a subset of number 19 I guess) and I did that too. As for listening to voices, well my work has started to incorporate much more of that since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 and 5. I still try and explore new recipes. If you’re working you can’t help needing to quickly bash out a familiar (and/or comforting recipe from time to time). &lt;a href=&quot;/four-recipe-book-recommendations&quot;&gt;The A-Z of Cooking by Felicity Cloake&lt;/a&gt; has been a useful aid, not to mention Ingrid (see number 9!). Despite all this experimentation, I still hate cucumbers and Ingrid’s allergic to tomatoes so there’s been little progress there either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 to 8. I do try. I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 and 10. I think &lt;a href=&quot;/the-same-but-different&quot;&gt;getting married&lt;/a&gt; satisfies the first of these. I don’t plan to become a parent though. Ambition number 9 can’t really be completed: being married sets up new challenges and rewards. While on the one hand, married life is a permanent sleepover with your best friend, you also have to figure out how to graciously stake out your own autonomy and/or trade it for something better. I’m not going to update my ambitions but number 9 would definitely become “Look after someone special and try to do it better each day”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11 to 13. Yeah so these are bit odd. Still working on them, still need to. But the fact that I need to work on this doesn’t bother me quite as much as it once did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourteen. Dear 2012-Matt, I know you’re probably a bit tweaked about the upcoming date of the Mayan apocalypse  (Spoiler: it happens but a bit later and we call it Brexit) but this whole dreams thing is something you can’t really control. You usually remember the sexy ones. Be content with that and try to chill about it a bit. Lots of love, 2019-Matt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen. I’m getting there. Note to self: must write more posts about art because it’s more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16, 17 and 18. You know how you have all these things that you’d love to do but you just don’t get the time? Well these come under that heading. I made a start with 16 in Peru but that picture of a tarantula on my face freaks some people out so I won’t post it here. As for driving, must I stop walking everywhere? As for learning to write left-handed, there are some people who (quite rightly) suggest that I might want to turn my attention to finishing off learning how to write right-handed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19 and 20. Working on it. &lt;em&gt;Nearly&lt;/em&gt; got to a similar telescope in Chile but it didn’t quite work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21 to 24. Another bundle of neuroses. I have disengaged from social networks somewhat and intend to go further. I haven’t taken up meditation at all because the inside of my head is way too noisy. What I did do (at Ingrid’s suggestion) is take up Pilates: I swear by it now. It’s not quite the same as meditation but I’ve found the improvements to my core strength to be quite useful for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty five. Again, &lt;a href=&quot;/any-sugar&quot;&gt;working on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty six. Dear 2012-Matt. It’s me, 2019-Matt, again. Isn’t this just the same as number 21? OK, one’s figurative and one’s literal. I get it. Well don’t worry mate, you are going to move house several times (spoiler alert) and every time you do you are going to realise you have failed this one repeatedly. Never mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;27 and 28. Well, Ingrid looks after the garden. I do the bins. As for writing people letters, I have enough trouble with this blog. Give me a break people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29 to 31. Reading &lt;a href=&quot;/the-overstory&quot;&gt;The Overstory&lt;/a&gt; has helped a bit with identifying the trees (number 29), but I must try harder. I am getting better at number 30 all the time. I hope. Well I try to hope. And as for number 31, I have masted the art of those sticky velcro tab things for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time passes you tend to favour good memories over bad, and you also feel less pressure to attain life goals. I’m not saying my life goals no longer exist, it’s more that I now realise that a set of ideals is something to try to optimise rather than flat out achieve. The process of checking the box is as important as the box getting checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t write a list today. I’ve not updated this one. If I never get to Slovenia, I won’t mind. If I still gum up at the prospect of public speaking, that’s not a failure more a sign that public speaking is important and that’s how my body lets me know. The ambitions I have now are internal, iterative and private. And in seven years time, it will still be the case that some are done and dusted, while other still remain on the horizon. Such is the business of being.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Four Recipe Book Recommendations</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/four-recipe-book-recommendations"/>
   <updated>2019-04-22T12:39:20+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/four-recipe-book-recommendations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-a-z-of-cooking-by-felicity-cloake&quot;&gt;The A-Z of Cooking by Felicity Cloake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for more luxurious and experimental recipes. There are 26 chapters, one for an ingredient beginning with each letter of the alphabet, but you probably guessed that already. Ingrid and I have been (very) slowly working our way through the chapters, making a couple of recipes from each one - we’re currently up to G for Garlic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite so far has been the bread dumplings in parmesan broth because it gives us a use for our many many parmesan rinds. Mind you, the red spiced pork belly that we made over Easter has come pretty close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-food-by-nigel-slater&quot;&gt;Real Food by Nigel Slater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more practical yet still somewhat decadent recipes I often turn to this gem by Nigel Slater. When I realised I’d given my copy away before going to South America I bought another one: Real Food is so good that I bought it twice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with The A-Z of Cooking the chapters are gathered around particular ingredients. The many different chicken recipes are very delicious, particularly the lemon and thyme roast chicken legs. Nigel can always be relied on to produce a recipe for something boozy and garlicky, great for entertaining on Sunday lunchtimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great recipe is the Chocolate Espresso Cake, which &lt;a href=&quot;/chocolate-cake-recipe&quot;&gt;I’ve copied out on this blog before&lt;/a&gt;. We regularly make this as a gluten free cake because it’s very tolerant of gluten free flour, probably on account of all the eggs, butter and chocolate that make up the bulk of the ingredients. We even used this recipe for our wedding cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foolproof-cooking-by-mary-berry&quot;&gt;Foolproof Cooking by Mary Berry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book that does exactly what it says on the cover. Most of the recipes in here are tasty and many of them are easy to make as well. In particular, from this book we’ve learned how to make barbecue chicken wings without using tomatoes and an amazing sausage cassoulet that you can live on through the winter (watch your waist though!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The giant cheese and parma ham straws recipe is useful too, especially now that you can get gluten free ready-made puff pastry. If ever a bank holiday looks like it’s going to be especially gloomy weather-wise, we just knock out a tray of these and bunker down. I find a tasty variation is to use Marmite instead of mustard (Ingrid prefers Vegemite!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;salt-fat-acid-heat-by-samin-nosrat&quot;&gt;Salt Fat Acid Heat by Samin Nosrat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a little bit different to the others as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saltfatacidheat.com&quot;&gt;it’s more of a complete cookery course&lt;/a&gt;.  You can read it like a book rather than simply as a set of recipes. Samin Nosrat writes about how the four titular elements of salt, fat, acid, and heat are the key elements of flavour, and how you can bring them together in different ways depending on the meal you want to create. It’s fascinating stuff and would be much easier to read if it didn’t make me quite so hungry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/gb/TITLE/80198288&quot;&gt;the Netflix show&lt;/a&gt;, which is also great. Samin is a really enthusiastic presenter and I spent the show just saying “yum” while wishing I had the time to cook everything she did. And visit that parmesan factory. And eat all the parmesan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her chocolate cake recipe looks even more indulgent than Nigel Slater’s, though the price of that indulgence seems to be fiddliness. I’ll report back when we’ve had a go at making it. Meanwhile, I can recommend the roast Brussels sprouts with butternut squash and macerated onions. We made that over new year and it was delicious: a wonderful new set of flavours wrought out of familiar ingredients, which is what this book is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five years after</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/five-years"/>
   <updated>2018-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/five-years</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five years ago I set out at 3am for Heathrow airport to catch the early morning flight to Madrid. There I connected with a flight to Quito in Ecuador. The previous days and weeks had been fraught with worry about whether I was doing the right thing. Did I get the right vaccinations? Would I have enough money? Would I cope with all that travel? Was I coming back? What was I going to do with all my stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I am not sure I had answered all those questions. I know I had a lot of vaccinations. I crammed as much as possible into a bag I had no locks for. I dumped most of my possessions into black sacks and slung them in the attic, despite not knowing when I would be back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lay awake that night. When my taxi arrived, I staggered down to the door with my bags. So much, and yet, in the most exciting way, so little for six months of travel. For the first time in a long time, I didn’t know what would happen next. And suddenly, I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat in gaudy Terminal 5, realising that London is strange in a way you don’t notice until you’re no longer living there. Inside, I rejoiced. On the flight to Madrid, I slept on a short-haul flight for the first and only time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things went a little wrong in Madrid. Someone rammed my foot with a baggage trolley and split open my hiking shoes - but at least they didn’t break my foot. I’d find out later that my bag didn’t make it on to the Quito flight. Fortunately I had a snap I’d put on Instagram to show the helpful people from the airline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight to Ecuador was great. I chatted to my neighbours, all natives of Quito, and tried to explain why I was making my trip. The map of the route around South America was explanation enough. The landing itself, a daredevil scooch over mountains that poked out of the pink clouds, as menacing as sharks circling in a pool. Everyone clapped once we were down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, a crazy taxi driver wound me down through Quito’s hills and mad traffic with reggaeton blasting away. I stared out of the window, grinning. I must have looked like a total rube. No wonder he didn’t have quite enough change for my shiny gringo dollar bills. Oh well, canniness would have to come later. The hotel had holes in the walls and my room looked… let’s say average. But I was there for adventure, not to write reviews on Trip Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a bag to unpack, I decided I couldn’t sleep until I’d investigated the hotel bar. It was closed. But I heard English voices (well Welsh ones actually), and met up Mim and Lee who would also be on the tour. With plans made for exploring the city the next day, and the growing realisation I’d been awake almost 24 hours, I went to bed happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years is an arbitrary length of time. It seems like ancient history and yesterday, all in one. Would I do it again? In a heartbeat. Could I do it again? Not now, not really. The pleasing thing is that I don’t need to. When I think of how muddled and unhappy I was, I am glad I did it. Sure, my planning could and should have been better, but, come to think of it, who in their right mind &lt;em&gt;plans&lt;/em&gt; an adventure?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Richard Powers, The Overstory 🌳</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-overstory"/>
   <updated>2018-10-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-overstory</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“The Overstory” by Richard Powers piqued my interest among the novels shortlisted for the Booker Prize. And &lt;a href=&quot;satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review&quot;&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt; the book that interested me most did not win. One year I will succeed in my prediction!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found “The Overstory” an enjoyable read. Its accessibility surprised me. Often people view Booker nominated novels as stuffy or over-intellectual. This novel however is a genuine page turner, full of emotion and heartbreak, not to mention plenty of science and awe of the natural world. Perhaps in another year it may have won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is about a set of characters all drawn together by trees. Many never meet one another, yet their stories all intersect, fusing together to form a whole. This is a lot like trees in a forest: some trees might never appear close together but the diversity of the forest enables them to influence one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the structure of the novel. It’s in four sections: seeds, roots, crown, and then more seeds. As you might guess, the story is cyclical and self-sustaining, much like a tree. In the first seeds section, Powers introduces us to his panoply of tree-related characters in vignettes. Some of these are breathtaking enough to be standalone short stories. You could read the first “seed” of the novel and leave the rest if you like. I reckon you would still have a different view on trees and humans afterwards. But why would you stop there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I found myself not stopping. For a week this book became my obsession. Even when not reading it, I’d think about it. I kept seeing different trees on the way to and from work, noting their shapes and leaves and seeds. Perhaps the autumnal weather enabled this: when trees are as demonstrative as they are in the waning season, you can’t help but notice them. But it’s also true that many of the human characters in “The Overstory” are easy to care about. I can’t remember reading a novel in years whose characters affected me the way these did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing is beautiful. Often clean and precise, but sometimes knotted and whorled, it picks out both a sense of wonder at nature and a bewilderment with humans. Powers shifts easily from characters to landscapes, from inner thoughts to intense conversations. Better yet is his ability to bring unusual experiences to life in your head. There’s a breathtaking section atop a massive Redwood that made me feel like I was there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of only two real drawbacks to “The Overstory”. The first is that plot runs out of steam toward the end. Perhaps this also mimics the life of a tree: they don’t just fall down, they falter and rot and mulch and give life to other things. The plot sort of does this too: bringing forth ideas as the plot peters out. The second is that at several points in the novel, it felt like there would be a supernatural resolution. While this would be at odds with some of the precise and scientific detail, I for one would have accepted a more fantastical ending. (However, this is part of the human problem that “The Overstory” addresses: our need for fantastical solutions to real problems. We are killing the planet and there is no magic to save us from ourselves, only ourselves and the resources that remain.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the market for an absorbing and brainy novel, with plenty of heart and character alongside, you would do well to check out “The Overstory”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Isaac Asimov, Foundation</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/foundation"/>
   <updated>2018-10-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/foundation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For our &lt;a href=&quot;the-same-but-different&quot;&gt;first anniversary&lt;/a&gt; we decided to exhange books. What better way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.hallmark.com/articles/anniversary-ideas/anniversary-gifts-by-year/&quot;&gt;celebrate a paper anniversary&lt;/a&gt;? Ingrid bought me the entire Foundation saga, most of which were &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcoverd.co.uk/archive/designers/topping-mike&quot;&gt;reissued in fancy new paperback designs by Mike Topping&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. All save for 1993’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7lueju/asimovs_forward_the_foundation_published_in_2016/&quot;&gt;Forward The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; that is, but Ingrid got me a copy anyway. Hence, here is a new series of blog posts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foundation novels detail a galactic empire in decline. A mathematician named Hari Seldon, using a novel science called psychohistory, realises that this is happening and formulates a plan for humanity, one that will reduce the time between empires. This, he reasons, will minimise human suffering and prevent an extended period of barbarism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered this sequence of novels when I was 12, drawn to them in the school library by their cool covers. I also enjoyed the entries of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that began several chapters. I think this format influenced other great sci-fi novels, like &lt;a href=&quot;dune&quot;&gt;“Dune”&lt;/a&gt; and “The Hitch-hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”. I read these voraciously and the rest of the stories… less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tvweek.com/tvbizwire/2018/08/one-of-the-most-important-sci-fi-works-of-all-time-to-become-tv-series/&quot;&gt;a TV series on the way&lt;/a&gt;, I threw myself into re-reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(Asimov_novel)&quot;&gt;“Foundation”&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it I remembered and other parts were like finding new rooms in an old house. The novel comprises five short stories that Asimov wrote for Amazing Science Fiction. They hang together well, perhaps better than a series of short stories has any right to. Some fun lies in turning over the bits that happen between the stories. I like how Seldon appears for a short time in the first story despite having a massive influence over the remaining novels. (Asimov couldn’t resist revisiting Seldon in later prequels, more on those in later posts…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What appealed to the younger me was psycho-history, the notion that historical events could happen according to a predictable plan. As I turned away from religious ideas, I sought comfort in these theories that are a sort of hybrid: scientific theories made dogma. Re-reading now, I marvel at how psychohistory is the epitome of what people who don’t understand economics think economics is. But that aside, the writing is good. There’s a directness and economy to the story that propels it along, even if some episodes don’t ring true. This is also true of the other books, so I will discuss this further in later posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is “Foundation and Empire”, my favourite of the original trilogy. I realise that this is a short introductory post, but as with the novels themselves, the real meat of these posts is still to come. Bear with me!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. D. Vance, Hillbilly Elegy</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/hillbilly-elegy"/>
   <updated>2018-09-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/hillbilly-elegy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy&quot;&gt;“Hillbilly Elegy”&lt;/a&gt; is the autobiography of JD Vance, a self-professed hillbilly made good who graduated from Yale Law School. I read it because reviews touted it as illustrating the economic conditions leading to Brexit and the implausible election of Donald Trump. As &lt;a href=&quot;space-between-this-and-that&quot;&gt;I wrote in an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, I’m keen to learn about why Brexit happened. However, I think this book fails to provide an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book. It gave me plenty to think about. The story Vance tells is entertaining, but falls short of presenting a meaningful social and economic analysis of the plight of the white working classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Vance does not claim to explain Trump’s rise. I’m not sure he’d be happy for anyone to describe his book as the “why of Trump”, beyond the extra attention and sales! He points out that working-class people who vote Republican do so for many, often complex, reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book doesn’t seem to propose many solutions for the disadvantaged white populations of America’s heartland. He explains how the current hardships in Appalachia originate in the people who colonised the region. These were people inclined by poverty and hard labour toward alcohol and tough living. Vance believes people should work hard and try to drive themselves upward. He also thinks that the state should step aside and allow people to derive value from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital&quot;&gt;social capital&lt;/a&gt; within their community. It’s clear that his experiences inform this world view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Vance, Appalachian communities have stagnated because they were aspirational. He blames parents who wanted their children not to have to work in factories for making them aim too high. He blames those same children for not wanting the jobs that Reagan, Bush and Clinton “gave away” to overseas companies. He may be right that social security systems can make it seem easier to sit at home rather than get a job. I feel that stronger workers’ rights and fewer limits on health care options would be better drivers to employment. Vance does not even consider that it may be the lack of these things that make jobs in factories and delivery warehouses unattractive to the current generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privilege is also woven through the story. Many times the police show up and take a sympathetic stance on his family’s dysfunction. For black Americans similar situations could have ended in the swift incarceration of a parent, or their death by a police officer’s firearm. The narrative arc of hillbilly made good is heart-warming and entertaining, but survival bias curdles it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ron-howard-hillbilly-elegy-movie-1202027659/&quot;&gt;The film will do great business, no doubt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, “Hillbilly Elegy” is a fascinating memoir but perhaps lacks in social and economic depth. It’s filled with striking arguments about the broken social contract in Appalachia (and the wider US) but offers few solutions beyond blaming its victims. If Vance is anything to go by, solutions include joining the marines and allowing police officers to a lenient view on domestic abuse. The book does not offer a salve to explain Trump’s disastrous election. Instead, it shows that a megalomaniac dilettante in the White House is more likely compound the problems of Appalachian communities rather than solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reboot</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/reboot"/>
   <updated>2018-06-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/reboot</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As much as I hate to write about writing, especially when I write so infrequently, I feel I need to reboot this blog. I wrote so few posts in recent months I considered giving up altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been stressed. Sometimes this manifests in being unable to sleep. Sometimes it manifests in all my interests and ideas seeming to be completely pointless. Sometimes one of those precedes the other. Sometimes it works vice versa. Often since getting back from Australia I’ve felt stuck in a vicious circle of insomnia and disinterest. Perhaps it’s just been the longest case of jet lag ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, I’ve tried to stay busy. Well I say busy, it’s more that Ingrid and I decided to get every Civilisation VI achievement. I bet that makes us sound &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; dull but we do other things I promise. We’ve started making cocktails. My goodness this post is becoming a hundred different cries for help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to write. I decided to back-date the series of posts about our trip to Australia to around the time the events occurred. I thought it would be nice to have a record of the holiday in real time. When planning the posts I could not believe how much we packed into our three and a half weeks. Beforehand it seemed like such a long holiday. However, during and afterwards it was nothing of the sort!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem with writing back-dated posts is what to do about ‘live’ posts: the ones you might see on Facebook and Twitter about what’s going on in my life. These ground to a halt even though I could write about ten book reviews right now. If my reading slowed down I would definitely worry for my mental health!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I love to tinker behind the scenes of the blog. This was one reason I switched to Jekyll. I’ve experimented with themes and toyed with writing my own. My hard drive is full of experiments in CSS and attempts to pull it all together in Jekyll. I imagine that the appearance of the site will change again soon despite my resolution to write more and tinker less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem is that I write about so many things. Another problem is that I want to write about &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; things. Everything from 2010 till now feels forced and embarrassing when I re-read it, and the stuff I draft in the meantime doesn’t feel much better. But throughout my time blogging I have learned writing regularly is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best tonic for my mental health. With the stress and pressure of buying a house, I need to get into good habits again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, I won’t let that slip by without further comment! Ingrid and I have bought a house. Or rather, at the time of writing, we are buying a house. It is the single most frightening thing to happen in a long time. It’s also incredibly exciting. I’m apprehensive about the future but I think it also opens up so many possibilities, and not just for DIY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I will crack on with the posts I have planned. Some won’t show up in the usual channels as they’ll be those backdated Australia posts I mentioned. Most will be book reviews to begin with because the list of posts to write is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; as long as the list of books to read…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also think about what this blog is. (Besides the egomaniacal ravings I type out to smooth out my crazy…) I think if I figure it out, maybe I can design a structure for the site that suits me. This might soothe my tinkering urges. In the meantime: bear with me, and thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Great Ocean Road</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-great-ocean-road"/>
   <updated>2018-02-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-great-ocean-road</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;articles/the-same-yet-different&quot;&gt;wedding present&lt;/a&gt;, Ingrid’s Mum Maria kindly took us for a trip along &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ocean_Road&quot;&gt;The Great Ocean Road&lt;/a&gt;, the longest war memorial in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stretching 151 miles from Torquay (not that one!) to Allansford, the road was deliberately built as a tourist attraction as a means of providing meaningful work for troops returning home from the First World War. Regarded as one of the world’s greatest scenic roads, it certainly holds it own against things like the roads I experienced in Chile and Bolivia when I travelled over the Andes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day we travelled from Lara to Port Campbell, taking in many breathtaking stops along the way. These included &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Apostles_(Victoria)&quot;&gt;the twelve apostles&lt;/a&gt;, which are very popular with tourists even though there are only eight left, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ard_Gorge&quot;&gt;Loch Ard Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, which has a fanciful tale of a shipwreck to entertain vistors. Other highlights were a stroll along the beach and later on a walk around a fern gully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/great_ocean_road/great_ocean_road_10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Panorama at Port Fairey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day we finished the section that we would be travelling, up to Port Fairey. Our drive back to Melbourne took an inland route. I was interested in just how much space there is in between places in Australia and of course in relative terms the journey was minuscule.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>More Melbourne</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/metros-suburbs-barbies"/>
   <updated>2018-02-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/metros-suburbs-barbies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On our second full day in Australia we went shopping in central Melbourne, before Ingrid’s mum Maria picked us up ahead of our trip along the Great Ocean Road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the metro into the city. I always love watching the fabric of cities knit itself together around train lines and Melbourne is no exception. Along the way, Ingrid had plenty of stories to tell about the various places she had lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Melbourne metro map is interesting. The line from Moonee Ponds loops around a central circuit before heading back out again. All the other lines do this as well, some go clockwise around the loop and others head anti-clockwise. The direction changes at midday or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got off at Melbourne Central, touching out our Myki cards and emerging into an enormous shopping centre. I blinked a lot, all of a sudden among bright lights and many shoppers. Out of the daylight and in the permanent evening of mall time, I think my circadian rhythm buckled a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully we soon found ourselves in daylight, staring up at the huge shot tower in the middle of the shopping centre. Bullets for old muskets were manufactured by dropping lead shot from a great height, from the top of the tower to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more mundane Telstra store we were looking for faced on to the tower. I examined paper lanterns in the deal displays for Chinese New Year while Ingrid got her old Australian mobile contract reactivated. The lady helping us suggested a nice coffee shop in the laneways and so went there, via a good number of additional shops, buskers, tea rooms, and more of Ingrid’s family history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laneways bristle with graffiti and small restaurants and cafes. At lunchtime they bustle with people grabbing a bite to eat: locals and tourists alike. We found our recommendation, ordered some coffee then settled on tempura cauliflower and chorizo on a bed of kale. I should have instagrammed it. Interesting dance music played, I longed to know what it was. Next to us a pile of second hand books lined the shelves below the till. Through a tiny porthole I could see the Japanese chef turning out each small order in double-quick time. A fish swam, disinterested, in an aquarium on a shelf next to the kitchen door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/more_melbourne/more_melbourne_01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Laneways&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left the bustle of the lanes and took ourselves down to Flinders Street. We examined tourist tat in a shop dedicated to tourist tat. I yearned for an “outback dunny” fridge magnet, but we bought postcards instead. Sometimes we’re too sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crossed the road and ate an ice cream in Fed Square. School kids slouched around. My eyes took in the zany architecture and we walked down to the river, taking selfies under what we called the Miss Fisher Bridge. Then we looped back into Flinders Street station and found the platform for the train back to Moonee Ponds. And as beautiful as the unseen spaces between stations are, this time I people-watched: I probably stared at the other passengers as I wondered about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/more_melbourne/more_melbourne_02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Posing under the Miss Fisher bridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Moonee Ponds we packed bags for the next few days and waited for Maria and Gary to pick us up. They drove us over to their house in Lara, a pleasant town outside Melbourne. Or was it yet another suburb? Or a suburb of the neighbouring city of Geelong? It all kind of sprawls, but in the nicest possible way. Lara itself could almost be the imaginary Erinsborough of all those episodes of Neighbours watched just before dinner in my youth: pretty houses arranged into suburban drives, community pools, utes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ate tea and cake with Maria and Gary. We talked about the journey, past events, family history. We were shown our room which is usually rented out for Airbnb guests (It’s very popular with travellers flying into Avalon airport, so if you ever need somewhere to stay after a late flight or before an early one…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening Ingrid’s sister Tamsin, her partner Tom and their children Mickey and Maddie came by for another tasty barbecue. The kids asked if I could chase them and not wishing to disappoint them, I duly obliged. I’ve never been very good at chasing people and I think I was just the right level of incompetent for them! It was great fun though! Apparently that night Mickey and Maddie talked excitedly about “the giant who couldn’t catch anyone”. Well, at least they thought I was tall?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taking It Easy In Melbourne</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/australia-2"/>
   <updated>2018-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/australia-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On our first full day in Melbourne we took it easy. It was warm and sunny, so different to the weather we’d left behind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingrid needed more time than me to sleep off her jet-lag. I sat in the sunshine and read the book I’d ignored on the plane. An easy read, it drew me into its characters. I’ll post a review later, perhaps after I have read the sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we took a tram ride to meet Ingrid’s friend. Tess is a hairdresser so Ingrid and I each got haircuts. I can recommend it as a good way to freshen up for your holiday. The last time I had my hair cut by someone else was for the wedding. It was nice to be neat and tidy ahead of meeting the rel’os. Tess gave me some tips on what to do when I cut my hair with clippers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and Tess both got married in the three and a half years since Ingrid left Australia. Both had never expected to do so. I can add myself as a third member of that club. We exchanged our mutual incredulity that we had. A bond between new friends and old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left the salon, Ingrid dragged me across the road into a wine warehouse (“This is a small one!”) just to show me the difference between the UK and Australia. Even though we’d only covered a small amount of ground on our first day, I began to realise that Melbourne is massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of the afternoon exploring Puckle street and the rest of Moonee Ponds. About halfway through a walk around the park we both felt beat so we headed back to base for a nap. Well I say nap, it was a more an extended session of chase the puppy and mop up after him until his owners got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening we had our first barbecue, a nice bit of kangaroo!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/australia_1/australia_1_01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Plane&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed to last forever but we made it. We left for Heathrow at 6AM and left London at around midday. I waved goodbye to home for nearly four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped over in Dubai for an hour or so while the plane refuelled. We walked in circles trying to shake off the fatigue. I’d equalled one of my longest ever flights just getting to Dubai and now I was facing almost twice as much time again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t win this car!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/australia_1/australia_1_02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Car We Didn't Win&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Airbus A380 is a great plane. The mind boggles when you start multiplying the number of rows of passengers by the number of passengers in each row. And there are two decks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched “Penguins of Madagascar” for the actor name puns and “The Captain Underpants Movie” for the fart jokes. I also watched “The Hours” because, well, I’d never watched it. There were no fart jokes. In the seat next to me, Ingrid watched all of Season 7 of Game of Thrones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we were off the flight and getting through customs was fine. I met Ingrid’s sister Marlies and her husband Butch. We described the flight. Thankfully, it was night time and dark outside so we were well primed for falling asleep. We had arrived!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Any sugar?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/some-sugar"/>
   <updated>2018-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/some-sugar</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not being much of a drinker, I’ve never felt the need to do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/dry-january-helped-me-take-back-control-of-my-drinking.aspx&quot;&gt;dry January&lt;/a&gt;. Also Ingrid and I sat in a restaurant in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattischrome.com/spain-new-year-201718/&quot;&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; on January 2nd drinking for the third night in row. We hadn’t got off to that great a start. Well today marks the completion of a dry month: dry January with a two day lag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also (mostly) managed to keep to my other goal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/16/case-against-sugar-sweetness-and-blight-rachel-cooke&quot;&gt;eliminating sugar&lt;/a&gt; from my tea and coffee. This meant I cut out at least three teaspoons of sugar a day for a month. I can’t say it was easy. For a while I compensated by hoovering up the post-Christmas chocolates. Then came a period of the blues, though that was probably just &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&quot;&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t call the third Monday of January &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/blog/truth-about-blue-monday&quot;&gt;“blue Monday”&lt;/a&gt; for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a few weeks I found myself enjoying cups of tea and coffee without sugar. My mood improved, which had nothing to do with a couple of sunny days and/or the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilization.com/news/entries/civilization-vi-gitarja-leads-indonesia/&quot;&gt;new Civ VI DLC&lt;/a&gt;. It all comes out for Macs much later than on PC and at unspecified times. It’s the gaming equivalent of “Waiting for Godot”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am looking for the next small modification I can make. I think it has to be related to sleep. I am reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/295665/why-we-sleep/&quot;&gt;“Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker&lt;/a&gt; and every sentence feels like a denouncement of my current habits. I’m a terrible sleeper and I need to get better at that. Perhaps one for when the post-Australia jetlag is over?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Diary?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-diary"/>
   <updated>2018-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-diary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year promises to be exciting so this week I tried to buy a diary. One of those day-to-a-page affairs for scribbling down all the things I’ve seen and learned about. I thought they might be cheap now the calendar is turning to February. No such luck. There were a few week-to-view diaries going for half price in Waterstones but nothing suitable for my needs. I have lots of Field Notes notebooks if my urge to write gets too much to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I also have this blog. It requires more self-censorship but that’s not a bad thing. When I read my old diaries I always wince at how catty I am! Even if the cattiness was justified, I prefer the outward-looking view of my blog exploits. It’s better not to commit your sassy put-downs to the ages. Less navel-gazing and more action is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; my new year’s resolution, but I feel like 2018 could be one of those years when I pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am wont to do I have changed the blog’s theme again. I’ve made a few minor cosmetic changes and enhancements on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://broccolini.net&quot;&gt;Diana Mounter&lt;/a&gt;’s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/broccolini/athena&quot;&gt;Athena theme&lt;/a&gt;. They are mostly tweaks to accommodate Jekyll features I have learned to love while using other themes. A few posts and pages may be broken for now, but I promise to fix them. Many posts with images no longer have images but this will be a short-lived state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the new year begins here. In two weeks I am off to Australia. As I said: very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri"/>
   <updated>2018-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I renewed our Cineworld passes as it is the season to go to the movies and check out the Oscar contenders. You nod along sagely while dreaming up superlatives to show how much you agree with the taste-makers. Or you can call such-and-such movie a pretentious load of crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”, it’s more the former. But I don’t have to say anything pretentious about the cinematography or its timeliness. Most people will recognise those elements. Instead, I can say it is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; film. An enjoyable movie. A flat-out entertaining one in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not think so from a summary of the plot. To track down who raped and murdered her daughter, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) has three billboards erected outside Ebbing, Missouri. They accuse the Sheriff (Woody Harrelson) of not doing enough to catch the killer. This causes uproar among the town’s population, not least a tetchy deputy, Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Three Billboards…” uses dark humour to deal with dark subjects. The humour is sometimes involuntary: characters bristle against one another and build up tension for a joke to jolt it away with a little blast of static. Other times, the jokes are genuine pratfalls or physical comedy. It is a movie that made me laugh more often and more heartily than I had expected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters are fascinating. By focussing on a subset of four, maybe five, characters throughout, it often feels like you are watching a play rather than a film. The morals of many characters are outright shady. Mildred, single-minded in her quest for justice, draws you in to her plight and keeps you on her side, even as she does some awful things. The way she sidesteps the hostility of the population is entertaining, yet it’s also cringe worthy when she goes too far. Also, if you don’t like dentists avoid this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Three Billboards…” asks many questions about gender roles and how we conduct ourselves in civil debate. Is there any substantial difference between three billboards erected on a sleepy road and an outspoken social media post? Is it right that one person can focus public discourse, no matter how justified their cause? How sensible is it to weigh the griefs and sensitivities of one person against those of another? Which crimes can be forgiven?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the film provides the answers to these questions. The ending is uncertain and feels unfinished. I joked with Ingrid about a sequel called “Four Billboards outside somewhere else”. However, it does a mighty job of raising those questions. Plenty of films worse than this one have won the best film Oscar. It will astound me if Frances McDormand doesn’t get the best actress award.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spain, New Year 2017/18</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/spain-new-year-201718"/>
   <updated>2018-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For new year Ingrid and I met up with Ingrid’s friend Ros at Barcelona airport. We went from there to Cadaqués on the Costa Brava. A winding drive over steep hills leads you down to a cute bay with the typical white houses and terracotta roofs. All the window frames were painted just the right shade of blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cadaques/Spain01.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;View of Cadaqués from the church.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cadaques/Spain02.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;View of Cadaqués from near to where we stayed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cadaques/Spain03.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the hills you need to drive through to get in and out of Cadaqués.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surrealist artist Salvador Dalí lived and worked in the area. This meant a trip to Figueres to see his Theatre-Museum and on new year’s eve a walk over the hill to Port Lligat to visit his house. Both required timed tickets. We couldn’t get into the Port Lligat house on our first day because there were no tickets left. Lucky for us that New Year’s Eve was so much better weather-wise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-short-note-on-the-dali-museums-and-houses&quot;&gt;A Short Note on the Dali Museums and Houses&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theatre-museum in Figueres is a great museum to wander around. It pays homage to Dali’s talent and versatility. However, it suffers from having few of his major works on show. To see a dripping clock you have to wait until you get to the reproductions in the gift shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the House in Port Lligat is a delight. They only allow ten people in per half hour slot. This makes for a rather brisk tour but there’s a greater focus on the man himself. You get to see his studio and his echoing room. The gardens were beautiful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cadaques/Spain10a.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Path down to Port Lligat.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cadaqués is also close to the eastern-most point of Spain, the lighthouse at Cap de Creus. On New Year’s Day, we woke up early and headed there. Three policemen managed the situation, telling people where to park. We walked the last two kilometres to the lighthouse in the pre-dawn light as a cool wind whipped us awake. The sunrise did not disappoint. A band played traditional Catalan folk music. People danced. Volunteers handed out hot chocolate. As the sun rose, I contemplated the year ahead and also how similar traditional Catalan dancing is to the hokey-cokey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of New Year’s Day wandering around Cadaqués, walking over to an abandoned private island fused to the bay. This was covered with olive trees (as is much of the area) and was beautiful in the early afternoon light. That night we had a lovely meal in a pizzeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Viva Catalunya!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cadaques/Spain15b.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Principal way to get to a lighthouse at 4am? Moped!.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cadaques/Spain16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Stunning landscape in the newly sunny new year.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cadaques/Spain17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;We spent the rest of the day exploring the little islands and inlets around the edge of Cadaqués.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cadaques/Spain17b.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;We spent the rest of the day exploring the little islands and inlets around the edge of Cadaqués.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we drove back to Barcelona, via a big detour to the medieval town of Besalú. When we arrived it was cold and grey so we had lunch and checked out the museum of miniatures (far better than I’d expected). The medieval bridge is the main attraction: it looked beautiful in the blue sky and sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That afternoon the motorway flew by until we got snared in Barcelona’s stressful traffic. We navigated to both hotels and the underground car park. That evening we walked to the Sagrada Familia and stared up at it in the dark. It sat there all impossible, dizzyingly tumorous, like an over-ambitious entry in a sandcastle competition. We resolved to come back when it is finished. It was much larger and more complete than on my last visit in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we explored the Ramblas and the old town. We covered a lot of ground, soaking up the atmosphere and ducking away from the crowds whenever they got too much to handle. I enjoyed the warm weather and the chance to see this great city once again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Top 10 Albums 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/top-10-albums-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/top-10-albums-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-grails-chalice-hymnal&quot;&gt;10. Grails “Chalice Hymnal”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some albums are good because a band continues making the music that you love. Some albums are good because a band takes their ideas a step or two further than before. Chalice Hymnal is that rare album that does both of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The references to past albums include the track Deeper Politics and Deep Snow II, and, as per albums past, these tracks evolve slowly out of languid guitar hooks and smoky atmospherics. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However Grails are also a restless band as well as a restful one. The sheer number of side acts that members of the band are involved with, including Watter and Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne, are testimony to that. As a result there’s also some revolution mixed in with the revolution here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Tough Guy for instance. The Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne project grew out of repurposing Grails tracks as instrumental hip hop. This track feeds that process back in the other direction with a swinging swagger that keeps the track in motion. As the title suggests it’s more robust than your average Grails tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pelham is a noise-fest reminiscent of bands like Russian Circles. The slightly-too-long closing track After the Funeral is a reminder that while this band once named one of their albums Doommonger’s Holiday, their tongues may not have been firmly in their cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite track is called Rebecca. It’s a beautiful and folky tune, the sort of thing that Grails seem able to dash off without even thinking about it. Its seemingly improvised nature gives it an emotional heft, after all it’s often more meaningful when we express emotion without intention, when we don’t even have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude this is another interesting and compelling album from Grails. It would serve as a good introduction if you’ve never heard their music before. If you have heard them before then you’ll know what to expect and I think you will like what you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-february-2017&quot;&gt;(February)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-shinichi-atobe-from-the-heart-its-a-start-its-a-work-of-art&quot;&gt;9. Shinichi Atobe “From The Heart It’s A Start It’s A Work Of Art”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album, which I had down for inclusion in an unwritten July album digest, it manages to create nostalgia for 90s dance music while still managing to be something novel, something creative. What you get an album of steady propulsive dance grooves and experimentation that gently passes you by. Like many of the albums on this list, it’s short and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the tracks seemed to be named after songs and albums in the New Order discography, while at the same time sounding nothing like New Order. I like the contrariness of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-mike-oldfield-return-to-ommadawn&quot;&gt;8. Mike Oldfield “Return to Ommadawn”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are phrases and sections that make me shiver. Other parts will make you think of rain drops tracking their way down window panes. Others are strong and bold and confident, all shiny with winter sunshine. It’s a beautiful melancholic experience with a radiant happy ending.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-january-2017&quot;&gt;(January)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-forest-swords-compassion&quot;&gt;7. Forest Swords “Compassion”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d looked forward to pointing out how similar and different this album was compared to Shinichi Atobe’s. This album by Forest Swords also managed to dredge up comparisons to the 90s golden age of dance music. However, while Shinichi Atobe provides a glossy sleek view of that era, Forest Swords instead look at it through layers of subsequent musical styles. You can hear 90s house and techno underpinning these tracks, but they also pulse with layers of dubstep and other twitchier noisy subgenres on top. “Compassion” creates a nostalgic feeling, just as “From The Heart…” does, but it uses completely different tools in order to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-jfdr-brazil&quot;&gt;6. JFDR “Brazil”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I really like this album. It’s short and coherent. It builds to its ending but each individual song stands alone despite being a component of a larger whole. I’d love to hear remixers get to grips with some of them. I’ll also be looking forward keenly to new songs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-march-2017&quot;&gt;(March)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-wire-silverlead&quot;&gt;5. Wire “Silver/Lead”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a solid collection of late-period Wire songs akin to “Change Becomes Us”. There’s your standard might-be-topical cut-up word play on songs like “Playing Up For The Fishes” and “Diamonds and Cups”. But there are also songs that are topical, such as “Sleep on the Wing” and “This Time”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a better love song on any of these ten albums than “Forever and a Day”, I’ll eat my hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-daniele-luppi-parquet-courts--karen-o-milano&quot;&gt;4. Daniele Luppi, Parquet Courts &amp;amp; Karen O “Milano”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This short album is a collaboration between composer Daniele Luppi, the New York band Parquet Courts and Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O. Luppi is a composer of film music and he’s the lead artist on Milano, a concept album about Milan in the 1980s. It’s a collection of tales about models, hustlers and artists. Adding Karen O’s voice and Luppi’s delicate arrangements to the muscle of Parquet Courts is an inspired choice. While I can’t say that the music itself evokes Milan for me, it is nonetheless an entertaining collection of songs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-november-2017&quot;&gt;(November)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-four-tet-new-energy&quot;&gt;3. Four Tet “New Energy”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are some really decent tracks here and I can’t wait to hear what remixers make of tracks like &lt;em&gt;Scientists&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lush&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2017&quot;&gt;(October)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in something of a crossover, Four Tet also provided a great remix of a track from album number two on this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-kaitlyn-aurelia-smith-the-kid&quot;&gt;2. Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith “The Kid”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The overwhelming sensation on &lt;em&gt;The Kid&lt;/em&gt; is joy. I love the way that &lt;em&gt;In The World, But Not Of The World&lt;/em&gt; totters just at the edge of control. The way that the pulses and strange animal-like noises of &lt;em&gt;Who I Am &amp;amp; Why I Am Where I Am&lt;/em&gt; slowly speed up as the track progresses are a delight. It’s wonderful to discover an experimental album that is so celebratory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2017&quot;&gt;(October)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-the-mysterons-meandering&quot;&gt;1. The Mysterons “Meandering”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album by young Dutch band &lt;a href=&quot;http://themysterons.nl&quot;&gt;The Mysterons&lt;/a&gt; is, quite simply, magnificent. It’s a collection of nine weird and fabulous songs, each of which is a majestic piece of story telling. The lyrics are so good I have to marvel that they’re writing in their second language. Indulge me as I list a few favourites. “Metamorphosis” leans heavily on the plot of teen movie “The Faculty” and unleashes a spectaclarly creepy riff in the middle 8 at a critical point in the story. “Binary Code” might borrow some of its plot from that kooky Star Trek TNG episode “10010101” but at heart it’s an anti-nuclear parable. “Turkish Delight” might simply be a song about Turkish Delight but listen again and you may find a sinister hidden meaning. Then there’s the gentle ephemeral closer “Bug Powder Dust” (cool title aside, it’s completely unrelated to the &lt;a href=&quot;uc14&quot;&gt;Bomb The Bass track&lt;/a&gt; which jinks and jitters matters to a cool close. I love this album and was tempted to instantly give it the &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; treatment. I hope there will be many more great albums in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Top 10 Songs 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/top-10-songs-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-12-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/top-10-songs-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-rolling-blackouts-cf-julies-place&quot;&gt;10. Rolling Blackouts CF “Julie’s Place”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just want a simple pop song about going out somewhere. I enjoyed the Rolling Blackouts’ EP “The French Press”. It contains many catchy tunes &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-march-2017&quot;&gt;as I noted in my review&lt;/a&gt;. “Julie’s Place” is the best, speaking of a need to be somewhere or a promise that you will go there. Given that I often listen to music between places, it’s nice to have a song or two like that on my playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-blanck-mass-rhesus-negative&quot;&gt;9. Blanck Mass “Rhesus Negative”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rhesus Negative” is the coarsest, most aggressive track on Blanck Mass’s album “World Eater”. I described it as about ten tracks mashed together at car crash speed. It’s long enough to live-tweet your response to each “movement”. However, it’s not ideal if you have a migraine. I’m not that sure what this kind of music is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; per se, only that it sounds amazing if you are in the right mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-joe-goddard-and-slo-ordinary-madness&quot;&gt;8. Joe Goddard and SLO “Ordinary Madness”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I often planned out album digests and didn’t have time to write them. Often it was because converting the site from WordPress was more time consuming than I first thought. On the other hand, I do try to do albums justice. Joe Goddard’s excellent album “Electric Lines” was one of those albums. Released in May, it’s jam-packed with splendid pop-dance music that recalls the best of Hot Chip and the halcyon days of early nineties dance music. “Ordinary Madness” is super cute and fun to get lost in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-fever-ray-to-the-moon-and-back&quot;&gt;7. Fever Ray “To The Moon And Back”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole of Fever Ray’s second album “Plunge” is dedicated to the pursuit of love, or at least the adventure of getting out into the world to find love. The first single “To the Moon and Back” is very much that mission distilled into three minutes, culminating in a line that almost feels like a punch-line. You hear it, and you think: did I hear that right? And when you realise you did, the song just ends… Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-united-vibrations-rocksteady&quot;&gt;6. United Vibrations “Rocksteady”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’d written up my ten favourite albums of 2016, then United Vibrations’ “The Myth of the Golden Ratio” would have been number one. UV have been quieter this year, releasing only this track (and a remix of it by Bad Milk). However, this sweet soulful groove shows that their jazzy experimental sound could benefit from being transplanted into more conventional pop songs. The lyric is about dealing with personal and political setbacks in a chilled-out and gracious way, and as such it is very much the sort of tune that needs more airtime in this day and age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-wire-playing-harp-for-the-fishes&quot;&gt;5. Wire “Playing Harp For The Fishes”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish can’t hear things. Which makes this song by Wire an excellent metaphor for people attempting to have a serious debate in current times. Like United Vibrations, Wire urge you to keep going. It’s less about transcending matters in blissful solidarity with friends and lovers, and more about wryly carrying on with the same determination. In many senses, this is what Wire have always done. This is why they continue to be treasured by their fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-dreadzone-area-code&quot;&gt;4. Dreadzone “Area Code”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This jaunty number seems a touch out of place on Dreadzone’s moody comeback album “Dread Times” but that just means it works well as a stand alone track. It’s infectious in the most joyous of ways, one of very few songs that I would consider putting on &lt;code&gt;repeat one&lt;/code&gt;. I listen to it and I’m burbling random lyrics from it for the rest of the day. Work colleagues who have ever seen me bobbing my head like a madman while figuring out some R code or filling in a spreadsheet should know that this song is the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-hampshire-and-foat-galaxies-like-a-grain-of-sand&quot;&gt;3. Hampshire and Foat “Galaxies Like A Grain Of Sand”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s Discover Weekly does some wonderful things, like lobbing this glacial piece of instrumental jazz at me on a hot July morning walk to work. Suddenly all the other people on the street melted away, the shadows drew themselves up over me and Chichester became a speck in the celestial expanse. It felt like I had been slung into orbit, not bad work for two shredded wheat and a cup of instant coffee. The entire album of the same name is excellent but this one track packs in all the essential elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-mysterons-dotted-lines&quot;&gt;2. The Mysterons “Dotted Lines”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because (spoiler alert) the Mysterons’ album “Meandering” is my favourite album of the year, it was very hard to pick out a favourite song from it for this list. It’s an album that works well as a whole, so I found myself choosing a different song almost every time I thought about this list. In fact I changed my mind again while writing this post. In the end I went for “Dotted Lines” because it shows the Mysterons to be capable songwriters and the song’s emphatic feminist rejection of plastic surgery and beauty magazines is worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-the-unthanks-what-can-a-song-do-to-you&quot;&gt;1. The Unthanks “What Can A Song Do To You?”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unthanks released an album inspired by the poetry of Molly Bloom in July. This song made its way into my Discover Weekly and it played immediately after “Glaxies…” (see number 3) and this completely bowled me over. It played as I walked into work and it was so captivating that I sat down at my hot desk and carried on listening to the song. At which point a fragment of poetry was read, seemingly spoken directly to me. It was another of those magical moments that sometimes happen while listening to music (or reading poetry). Moreover, that same magic seems to occur again each time that I listen to the song. What can a song do to you? Good question…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spotify-playlist&quot;&gt;Spotify playlist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a spotify playlist of the songs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/mattischrome/playlist/5XChBveXo258jEREYLEd0B&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;bjork-utopia&quot;&gt;Bjork &lt;em&gt;Utopia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Utopia” is Björk’s ninth album. It’s a happier album compared to the emotional wreckage of “Vulnicura”. But while “Vulnicura” was a compelling if uncomfortable listen, “Utopia” is more comfortable and, unfortunately, not that compelling. This is old ground retrodden with few glimmers of past glories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brevity, succinctness and sharpness are all gone. Even on the best songs (the first three), there is very little strength in the lyrics. The music is all texture and no melody. And while formlessness and adaptability are central to the album’s lyrical themes, the songs themselves are ill-served by allowing these same concepts to take hold of their arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs on “Vespertine” handled similar subject matter with intricate and complex beats. Those songs managed to still &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; songs despite the experimentation. On “Medulla”, Björk masterfully arranged voices and teased out complicated emotions with the bare minimum of technology. Whereas on “Utopia” the technology swamps everything and smothers the many good ideas that sit within the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps time will help me appreciate this album more. I can think of similar albums that took me a while to get into. It took me ages to realise just how good “Biophilia” is (Oh for a song with as catchy a chorus as “Virus” here) and so perhaps there are hidden depths to it. Because it’s Björk I will keep trying, but be warned “Utopia” is hard work. However, past history says it may yet be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phoebe-bridgers-stranger-in-the-alps&quot;&gt;Phoebe Bridgers &lt;em&gt;Stranger in the Alps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like Mary Epworth’s “Elytral” a few months back, I was introduced to Phoebe Bridgers’ album “Stranger in the Alps” by Spotify’s Discover Weekly feature. The song was called “Emotional Motion Sickness” and draws on that strange dislocation you feel when you’re stuck in a relationship’s that’s going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as before, Discover Weekly has gone and recommended the best song, but there’s plenty of material to enjoy on “Stranger in the Alps”. I’d describe her sound as a bit like a country version of Elliott Smith: songs with a keen sense of melody and sadness. It’s the sort of music I try to avoid in the darker months, but there’s also a (bitter) sweetness that makes the darker hues more palatable. If sad songs are your bag, you might like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;watter-history-of-the-future&quot;&gt;Watter &lt;em&gt;History of the Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watter are a “supergroup” featuring at least one member of Grails, whose “Chalice Hymnal” is one of my favourite and most played albums this year&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I enjoyed Watter’s first album “This World”, which was released back in 2014 and was one of my favourite albums of that year. I reviewed it &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-june-2014&quot;&gt;in an album digest in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This World” was full of slow burning guitar tracks and “History of the Future” provides more of the same. This bunch feels a bit more Grails-y and that’s not a problem for me. It’s an enjoyable sequel, though I do wonder what else this music for apart from watching the world go by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re pushed for time, check out “The Cloud Sanctuary” and the title track, which are the tunes representative of the album as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;neil-finn-out-of-silence&quot;&gt;Neil Finn &lt;em&gt;Out of Silence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has the right to complain about running out of ideas for songs, it must surely be Neil Finn. He’s written so many great ones over the years for Split Enz, Crowded House and for various solo projects. While there have been some rather odd albums (I’m thinking of 2000’s “One Nil” and the last Crowded House album in particular), the quality has rarely lapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album was written and recorded in a short space of time earlier in 2017. It doesn’t show, save for the fact that there is only one uptempo song&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: the gloriously spare “Second Nature”. “Out of Silence” showcases Neil’s excellent song writing skills and unlike “Utopia” it doesn’t attempt to reinvent the wheel, just to knock out a few decent songs. “Terrorise Me” is a big-hearted and sincere response to the Bataclan atrocity in Paris, turning difficult subject matter into art. It should be a song that’s hard to listen to and yet he finds a way to articulate a response to harrowing events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the songs are sketchier than others. “The Law is Always On Your Side” doesn’t really fill the outline that it sketches of a traumatic childhood. “More Than One of You” seems to run out of steam. “Widow’s Peak” is a strange dream-like song that I think could do with a little more polish - perhaps that might happen one day. On the other hand “Chameleon Days”, “Alone” and “Second Nature” seem complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise: “Out of Silence” is an interesting insight into the creative process of one of the best ever writers of pop music. It’s short and bittersweet, but if you love Finn’s earlier work you will definitely enjoy this.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For more information, there’s a top 10 post coming before the end of the year. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I wrote songs, I always found it was the uptempo ones that were harder to come up with. You need more words in your lyrics, more notes in your melodies 😉. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Turkey and Sweet Potato Stew</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/turkey-and-sweet-potato-stew"/>
   <updated>2017-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/turkey-and-sweet-potato-stew</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s a recipe to use up your turkey leftovers after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need a slow cooker or an oven-proof cooking dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About four portions of cold turkey, torn into bite-sized pieces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sweet potato, chopped into small slivers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 carrot, chopped into small slivers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 onion, diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 cloves of garlic, diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tsp mixed herbs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tsp smoked paprika&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20g butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50g diced chorizo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 chicken stock cube mixed in about 700ml water (see method)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;method&quot;&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Melt the butter and fry the onions on a medium heat until golden.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the garlic and fry this mixture for a further thirty seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the diced chorizo and continue to fry, adding a little stock and turning down the heat if things get a little too sticky.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold in the cold turkey and mix into the onions, garlic and chorizo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add half of the stock and bring to the boil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the carrots, the sweet potato and the remainder of the stock.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transfer to a slow cooker or the oven proof dish. If you’re using a slow cooker, you need to make sure liquid covers the contents of the pot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the default high setting of your slow cooker, or cook in the oven at 160C for about two hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check on the pot when about 30 minutes of cooking time remains. If you need to thicken the mixture, stir about a tablespoon of cornflour into about 20ml of water and then add this to the pot, stirring it in well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve with rice and a green vegetable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>A trip to Iceland. Part 3: Flu∂ir to Vík.</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-trip-to-iceland-part-3-even-more-waterfalls"/>
   <updated>2017-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-trip-to-iceland-part-3-even-more-waterfalls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;iceland-part-two&quot;&gt;We left Gulfoss&lt;/a&gt; and drove through the countryside to Fluðir where our next hotel stay would be. The hotel had cute little cabins arranged around a central square and the room itself was comfy and warm. Our dinner was nice enough, although we had a bit of a Fawlty Towers moment with Ingrid’s chicken salad. First it went back because they didn’t leave the BBQ sauce off. Then it came back &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; tomatoes. And then back again with more BBQ sauce. Fourth time lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluðir is a small village nestled between some rare hills in the middle of nowhere. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://secretlagoon.is&quot;&gt;Secret Lagoon&lt;/a&gt; is nearby but we passed on the opportunity as we were both tired from the day before. We rested until checkout time and then set off for more adventures. First we visited the oldest church in Iceland at Skalholt. This was the site of the first Icelandic capital until Reykjavík became a better place to build the main settlement. It’s strange to think of a bustling settlement now that nothing is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were fortunate to take in both the main church and the crypts below. Despite outward appearances and the bleak setting, made all the more so by the biting wind whipping up off the snow, the interior of the church was beautiful. It was warm and calm. Sunlight poured in through modern and colourful stained glass windows. In the crypts were old tombstones with interesting placards telling their stories. Most were carved in Copenhagen and then shipped to Iceland, which highlights their importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we drove to &lt;a href=&quot;http://kerid.is&quot;&gt;Kerið&lt;/a&gt; to see the volcanic crater lake. Much like everything else during our visit, it was covered in snow. This made for a cautious walk around the top as the paths down to the lake were closed off. The lake itself is at the same level as the water table and is not caused by rainfall. It was frozen over and some parts were very thick, having refrozen over several times. As with Þingvellir, it would be nice to see it again one day in an unsnowy state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had lunch in Selfoss and headed out for Vík on Route 1. On the way we stopped for a cup of tea at a cafe run by the Icelandic equivalent of the store owners from The League of Gentlemen. As with most countries I tried to read a newspaper and pretend that I understood it. We drove on through a town called Hella, where (presumably) American teens posed with the road sign featuring the town’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our destination was the Seljalandsfoss, a beautiful waterfall (yes, another one) that cascades over a rocky plateau. In the bright wintery sunshine, rainbows scattered and split away from the falling water. A newly wed couple were having their photo taken beneath the waterfall. The bride looked particularly chilly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just along the road is Skogafoss, which Icelanders voted as the best waterfall in Iceland. I can see the attraction, a huge span of water falls off the rocks in a huge horizontal curtain. You can walk up a vast path leading up to the mouth of the waterfall, though at our visit the conditions were icy and treacherous. Wooden stairs wind up the cliffs along side for the chance to look down from above but we didn’t have enough time left before dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the light faded we drove along winding roads to Vik. The hotel was modern and warm so we decided to leave exploring the town for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, November 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-november-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-november-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;00110100-01010100-0181&quot;&gt;00110100 01010100 “0181”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a reissue of a Four Tet rarity from 2013 that has recently surfaced on Spotify under an alias&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “0181” collects a series of short experimental pieces from throughout his career, though I’m not enough of a nerd to know whether they are in any particular order. &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2017&quot;&gt;Last month&lt;/a&gt;’s ‘proper’ Four Tet album “New Energy” has a lot more bounce to it, but “0181” nevertheless has some interesting moments that raises it above mere curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the track titles are formatted as telephone numbers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (0181 was once the dialling prefix for outer London). The opening tracks 0001 to 0004 sound most like his more recent material, while 0005 is a spray of spindly synth lines that recall earlier albums like “Pause”. A lot of the tracks sound really good on headphones as pieces that get out of the way while you get on with things. Some tracks (like the second half of the aforementioned 0005) lurch into hip-hop or jungle genres for a while, so not everything is there to be listened to passively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout I spotted some nice allusions to other artists. 0007 and 0010 are both more like jazz improvisations than electronica, 0009 sounds like one of Aphex Twin’s more mellow compositions, and 0013 is a short sketch that reminded me of beats from “Dead Cities” by the Future Sound of London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0014 reminds me of his remix of Beth Orton’s “Daybreaker”, though I haven’t listened to that for years (must find my copy) so I could be completely wrong. I listened to the final track 0016 while I walked through Chichester in the dark and its tinkling pianos and strange insistent flute-like pulses made for a perfect soundtrack for shadowy alleys and orange street lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, “0181” is a pleasing collection of downtempo sketches that is an interesting complement to “New Energy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;james-holden-and-the-animal-spirits-the-animal-spirits&quot;&gt;James Holden and the Animal Spirits “The Animal Spirits”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic producer James Holden decided to experiment with live instrumentation, forming an improvisational group named the Animal Spirits. The result is a charming album that is less abrasive than much of his previous material. I wrote about his previous album “The Inheritors”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-july-2013&quot;&gt;July 2013&lt;/a&gt;. It was an intriguing album of electronic music, quite muscular in its way. Re-listening to “The Inheritors” now, I can hear the elements that were perhaps the beginnings of the improvisational style of “The Animal Spirits”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early tracks like “Incantation For An Inanimate Object” and “Spinning Dance” have an earthy feel. “Incantation…” rises out of the speakers on a fog of eerie plainsong, hissing electronics and the jangle of prayer bells. Eventually the ambience gives way to “Spinning Dance” and a riff that grows and grows, becoming as frenetic as a dance around a roaring camp-fire on a dark night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pass Through Fire” builds a motorik rhythm out of a folksy snippet of music before saxophones burst in and everything goes crazy. The folk figure remains throughout like flames threatening to engulf the rest of the music. “Each Moment Like The First” repeats this trick, sounding like a cross between the theme tune of an 8-bit Dungeons-and-Dragons-themed computer game and a long-lost track by Kraftwerk. And more besides. “The Beginning &amp;amp; The End Of The World” manages to sound like every track of Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side Of The Moon” played at once, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On “Thundermoon Gathering” I’m reminded of Norwegian band Supersilent, a trio of jazzy improvisers whose unspoken mission was to jam their way through long unstructured pieces while making as much noise as possible. 
The more atonal elements continue to manifest on the title track, albeit underpinned by the most overt electronic riff on the album so far. It makes me imagine something eldritch coming into being under a bright full moon in a cold dark copse of sinewy yew trees. And yet there’s also something about the insistent hyperactive rippling of the synth that’s also celebratory, a sense that everything is coming into being at once. Old and new, animal and machine, mystical and practical…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s something of a shock when all that quickly fades away and “The Neverending” introduces a funky beat. It’s by far and away the most lyrical thing here, developing into something beautiful that feels tangible and not, all at once, like sunshine on a winter day. With the most prominent synth lines on the entire album, it shows that these elements are as crucial to Holden’s music as the live instrumentation he’s sought to include on this album. This is borne out again on “Go Gladly Into The Earth” which pulses with bliss and contentment, mixing both elements in a true fusion of the machines and instruments with the animal spirits in charge of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That fusion of man and machine seems to be the whole point of this album. It demonstrates that even the slightest of human touches can enliven the sparest electronic music, and also that the slightest of electronic touches can elevate a repetitive riff into something sacred. This is a fantastic album that also enriches its predecessor. I’d urge you to give both a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;daniele-luppi-parquet-courts-and-karen-o-milano&quot;&gt;Daniele Luppi, Parquet Courts, and Karen O “Milano”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short album is a collaboration between composer Daniele Luppi, the New York band Parquet Courts and Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O. Luppi is a composer of film music and he’s the lead artist on Milano, a concept album about Milan in the 1980s. It’s a collection of tales about models, hustlers and artists. Adding Karen O’s voice and Luppi’s delicate arrangements to the muscle of Parquet Courts is an inspired choice. While I can’t say that the music itself evokes Milan for me, it is nonetheless an entertaining collection of songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Soul and Cigarette” feels like it’s been plucked from the more introspective moments of last year’s “Human Performance”. There are fantastic lyrics throughout the song, particularly the lines about “clapping dirt to a cloud with his hands”. “Talisa” and “Mount Napoleon” are both about models and fashion. The former a model trying to make it big, the latter about a coke-addicted rake prowling the upscale shopping streets of Milan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile “Flush” is just &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; (not that that’s a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; thing). Other than some Italian lyrics towards the end of the song, I can’t connect it to the Milan theme at all. However, it’s great fun and enjoyably sweary 😆, not to mention the taut CAN-like strut that underpins the song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Memphis Blues Again” is told from the point of view of Ettore Sottsass, the Italian designer who founded the Memphis Group, who designed postmodern furniture from 1981 to 1988. They were so named because the Bob Dylan song “Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again” played at their first meeting, a fact that this song plays with by referencing Dylan’s track in the title and chorus. It’s an amazing rant of a track with &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/13135913&quot;&gt;droll lyrics&lt;/a&gt; like “Minimalism’s absurd / To me its just a word / I wished I’d never heard” and damned funny too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite track is “Pretty Prizes” which tells the tale of a sex worker who cheats their client. Because the vocal alternates between Andrew Savage of Parquet Courts and Karen O, I find the gender of the hustler changes each time I listen to it&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It amuses me either way, as the sleazy businessman in his hotel room with a view of Il Duomo deserves his comeuppance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that the album peters out with a few more songs and a weird skronky instrumental. The album’s short enough that this doesn’t matter. I doubt I’d have realised that this wasn’t just a plain Parquet Courts album but I’m glad that I found it. I’ve bought a copy on vinyl. Much like &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-may-2016&quot;&gt;“Human Performance”&lt;/a&gt;, I imagine it’s a record that I will flip over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fever-ray-plunge&quot;&gt;Fever Ray “Plunge”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karin Dreijer of defunct electronic band The Knife returns under her solo alias Fever Ray. Eight years after her eponymous debut, it’s almost as if she’s never been away. “Wanna Sip” is a harsh opening track, her unique voice combines with fireworks of synths and ominous bass lines. Things soften up on “Mustn’t Hurry”, a slow spoke-sung track not unlike “Triangle Walks” from her debut album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A Part of Us” is a cute duet with Tami T. Like many of the songs on “Plunge” it has simple lyrics with a particularly beautiful line about walking hand in hand into the morning mist. “Falling” is a queer rights song. It also begins with these wonderful laser arcing riffs, which are prominent throughout all the songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“IDK About You” is an exuberant song about new love. The bridge references a New Order song that I can’t quite place. It’s also a lot like the version of The Knife’s “Bird” that’s on the “Shaken-Up Versions” EP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next song “This Country” lays down the marker for the theme of the album - the way that your life is supposed to change when you get married and/or have kids. Obviously this is an interesting concept for me given recent events in my life. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/18/fever-ray-pleasure-patriarchy-political-revolution-plunge-karin-dreijer&quot;&gt;an interview with the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; she says “This [album] is about freedom, and curiosity. Now I think it’s absolutely possible to create a family that isn’t a nuclear one, but I didn’t know that then. I had lived a very feminist way of life before I had kids and I was shocked at how society treats you when you become a mother. You’re basically supposed to cut your arms and legs off and stay in the house.” The outro consists of the line “This country makes it hard to fuck” repeated over and over. When you think about it – no matter where you live – it really does&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To The Moon and Back” is the best pop song of the year and is certainly has the best final line. “Red Trails” evokes her excellent cover of Peter Gabriel’s “Mercy Street”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and has some wonderful celtic violin samples. It’s the most satisfying track musically. “Mama’s Hand” returns to similar territory as The Knife’s “Silent Shout”, with a similar riff and structure to “Forest Families”. It’s like a gentler version of “We Share Our Mother’s Health”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the first Fever Ray album, this pares down the rougher edges of the work of The Knife and builds up a surprisingly robust collection of bizarro pop songs. They’re about important matters but they’re also by turns sincere and cheeky. It’s an enjoyable album that I will likely listen to for a while yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playlist&quot;&gt;Playlist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a Spotify playlist of this month’s albums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/mattischrome/playlist/7DMGU4srb8ufgtUZSyX5Ny&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;00110100 01010100 apparently encodes to “4T”. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, “0181 000 0001”. In this review I refer to tracks by their last four digits. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Excluding EPs and the like. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Presumably Parquet Courts wrote and performed demos of the songs and the results were too good with both singers. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Something that may be the subject of another post, perhaps. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I think Peter Gabriel chickened out when he used Elbow’s cover on the “New Blood” album, it’s good but not as ethereal and displaced as the Fever Ray version. Given the provenance of the lyrics, it feels like a lost opportunity. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a perfect confluence of &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2011&quot;&gt;last month’s album digest&lt;/a&gt;, here’s an excellent Four Tet remix of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith’s “I Will Make Room For You” from her album “The Kid”. I’ve put it into a playlist with “Lush” from Four Tet’s “New Energy” album and the original version of “I Will Make Room For You.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Matt Haig, Reasons to Stay Alive</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/reasons-to-stay-alive"/>
   <updated>2017-11-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/reasons-to-stay-alive</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After I read &lt;a href=&quot;hello-america&quot;&gt;“Hello America”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;like-a-mule-ice-cream-sun-manyika&quot;&gt;“Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun”&lt;/a&gt; to Ingrid, it was her turn to read something to me. We settled on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matthaig.com/reasons-to-stay-alive/&quot;&gt;Matt Haig’s memoir of anxiety and depression “Reasons to Stay Alive”&lt;/a&gt;, which is as uplifting and life-affirming as its title suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book begins with its author standing atop some cliffs in Ibiza, crushed by depression and anxiety and determined to die. Fortunately he doesn’t go through with it and eventually this book detailing his experiences of recovery came out of it. It’s an honest warts-and-all account of what it’s like to be a depressed person and, perhaps even more crucially, what it’s like to live with a depressed person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking why on earth would I want to read about that? Well for one thing you might be or know a depressed person. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/statistics&quot;&gt;The odds are high.&lt;/a&gt; Thanks to decreasing stigma around mental health, you might even know you know someone. Besides, even if you aren’t a depressed person or you do not know a depressed person, this book is so generously and humanely written that it will likely make you feel good too. Given that it’s a book about &lt;em&gt;overcoming&lt;/em&gt; depression, it’s not relentlessly grim but instead a vibrant celebration of life and adversities conquered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its title, “Reasons to Stay Alive” is not a self-help book &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. There’s no chapter listing actual reasons to stay alive&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Instead Matt Haig details his grim determination to survive despite inner voices that say they want the opposite. Several sections are constructed as conversations with past selves, illustrating how the passage of time can totally alter your perspective on things. I think many people who have endured depression will recognise these conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, “Reasons to Stay Alive” is a quick, easy read (despite the subject matter) and a valuable book. I think it will make a difference to people coping with depression and their families. I also think it’d be a good place to start for people who haven’t had depression or anxiety who want to understand what it feels like from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There’s a whole chapter of things Matt now enjoys having once thought he would never enjoy anything again. This blog might be thought of as the equivalent of that chapter for me ☺. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Beetroot Bolognaise</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/beetroot-bolognaise"/>
   <updated>2017-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/beetroot-bolognaise</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We cook this version of bolognaise with beetroot due to Ingrid’s tomato allergy. This recipe is an attempt to capture what we do on the fly. The key to it is using the wine, the Worcestershire sauce and the herbs to even out the sweetness of the beetroot. If you can manage that, it’s super tasty. The sauce usually ends up being an unusual but pleasing pink/purple colour, as you will see from the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients-serves-4-to-5&quot;&gt;Ingredients: (Serves 4 to 5)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~500g turkey/pork/beef mince&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 beetroot, grated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 carrot, grated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 courgette, grated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least 3 cloves of garlic, diced or squashed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 onion, finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A glass of red wine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worcestershire Sauce, to taste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ground black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~2 tsp Italian herb seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 or 3 bay leaves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 red chillies, finely diced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;method&quot;&gt;Method:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fry the onions, chilli and garlic in butter until tender.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the meat and fry until browned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the grated ingredients - the beetroot, carrot and courgette - and cook until softened.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the liquids. The amount of Worcestershire sauce will depend on your wine. If the wine’s full bodied, you’ll probably need less Worcestershire sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now season while everything bubbles. We like Sainsbury’s Italian herb seasoning which is a blend of all sorts. In a pinch just oregano will suffice. Grind over lots of black pepper. Throw in a couple of bay leaves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cover and allow to bubble away while you cook the pasta, stirring occasionally. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>A Little Lesson in R</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-little-lesson-in-r"/>
   <updated>2017-11-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-little-lesson-in-r</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had to compute an indicator this week. It had confidence intervals that relied on taking 100,000 samples from the indicator’s approximate distribution. I had to repeat this over multiple GP practices and for twelve different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to use &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; because I thought it would help me organise all subgroups involved. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mutate_at()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; heavily and thought that &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; was keeping everything organised. However, when I moved from the 10 samples I’d used for testing to the 100,000 samples required by the specification of the indicator, my code moved to a crawl. Fearing that my work laptop was a little puny, I left it running overnight on my Mac&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and by morning R was still holding up its infuriating little stop sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how could I fix it? The programmer in me returned to the for loops that I’d tried to avoid. I overhauled the code using base R and vectorised &lt;code&gt;sapply&lt;/code&gt; commands. These were handy, cutting out some of the loops, though I still used a loop for each of the sites. This is not an unfamiliar approach for me: I used the same technique to run my &lt;a href=&quot;swaptastic-part-2&quot;&gt;sticker swapping simulations&lt;/a&gt; last year. The original &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; commands aren’t designed for passing around so many numbers about, at least not in this particular way&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end most of the work was done by this single line of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;sapply(sapply(rep(1,num_samples), 
               runif),
        qnorm,
        sample_mean,
        sample_sd)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks complicated but can be unpacked as follows: &lt;code&gt;sapply&lt;/code&gt; takes a vector and a function, applying the function to each element of the vector. The first, inner, call to &lt;code&gt;sapply&lt;/code&gt; constructs the vector for the second, outer, call. The vector constructed consists of uniformly generated random numbers between 0 and 1 (using &lt;code&gt;runif&lt;/code&gt;). The second &lt;code&gt;sapply&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;qnorm&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which is R’s approximation to the inverse cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. The additional parameters to the second &lt;code&gt;sapply&lt;/code&gt; are the parameters required by &lt;code&gt;qnorm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new code ran on my work laptop and took just over four minutes to finish. This is what stunned me into writing this post. Even though both bits of code had taken a similar amount of time to run in the test case, the time invested in writing things properly is well worth the extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There will be future posts about &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This indicator involved the use of publicly available data so I was free to use the code at home. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That said, at the time of writing there is &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/2813&quot;&amp;gt;an open github issue&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; about the slowness of &lt;code&gt;mutate_at()&lt;/code&gt; in the current version of &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Various properties and generators of random numbers from various distributions are discussed in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://mattischrome.com/generate-random-numbers-in-r/&quot;&amp;gt;this post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Suits Me</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/suits-me"/>
   <updated>2017-11-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/suits-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks I have worn a suit to work. I bought a new furry woolly suit a few weeks ago and have alternated between it and my old one. I also bought new shoes that gave me blisters and made me cry. Enough time has passed that by now it feels natural rather than silly and those shoes don’t eat my feet as much as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I feel calmer before I go to work as a result of wearing the suit. Suits are very little fuss. Pick the suit, pick the tie, job done. Besides, a suit flatters a man of my age and inclination towards biscuits. And finally my tie collection gets to see the light of day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A suit’s not that expensive. If I can get a year out of each suit, or a bit more than two years by alternating between two suits, I reckon it’s cheaper per month than the average mobile phone contract. It might cost me a bit more now that it’s getting colder, because I will need a new coat as well. Now the dark nights are drawing in, I’m having to dash home to beat the chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’ve had questions about whether I’ve had a job interview. These made me think about one particular interview in August 2014 where I pretty much got undressed out of my suit. I took off the jacket, then the tie, then rolled up my sleeves. I don’t know what sort of signals that body language sent out. Was it nerves? Was I expressing a preference for stripping over writing web interfaces for smart meters? To this day, I’m not sure. I hope these days I send out the sense of calm and assuredness that I feel from wearing a suit.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Three Years</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/three-years"/>
   <updated>2017-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/three-years</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three years ago today I moved in to my little flat in Chichester, soon to start a new job. I had no money left but at least, after a character building stint of six months sleeping on the floor, I had a bed. In the intervening three years, my job role has expanded, I’ve done another degree, the flat has become a home, and I’ve met and married Ingrid. Add to that the fact that it’s almost four years since I left for South America and I start to realise that I’ve done a crazy amount of things in that time. I don’t intend to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of things to be grateful for. Friends and family, the works of great artists, and the joys of nature. I think of seeing geysers and waterfalls in Iceland, but also of watching Blackbirds protecting a fallen chick from a predatory cat in the neighbour’s garden. Sometimes I get a bit giddy just from studying one of our little cacti!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also all sorts of things left to do. I think of upcoming challenges and I realise that if I can do so much in that space of time, then they won’t really be much to worry about. I realise that the world has gotten darker and stranger too, but here at home with the lights on the night can be held at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time moves on, I look forward to everything that’s coming and will try to face things as I always do: with curiosity, excitement and the hope that one day I will be able to write about it. I hope that the next three years are as awesome as these have been, that all these little moments continue to snowball together in this wonderful experience of living. Health and happiness to you all!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, October 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-october-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-october-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;mary-epworth-elytral&quot;&gt;Mary Epworth “Elytral”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album came to my attention because its lead single “Me Swimming” appeared on my Discover Weekly playlist. I’d never heard of Mary before but this album was one of those nice discoveries that one sometimes makes when one tries to broaden what one listens to. The aforementioned “Me Swimming” is probably the best track, a beautiful slice of summery experimental pop layered over a beat that you can imagine as the kicks of a swimmer compared to the swirling lyric that imitates the pull of the strokes through the water. Or the other way round. I was a latecomer to swimming, I’m not very good at it. But I do know a good song when I hear one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album is an interesting mix of songs made enjoyable by experimentation and songs made enjoyable by virtue of being lovely songs. It’s a little frustrating that these modes rarely intersect, perhaps only on “Me Swimming” but it’s still a good album for a Sunday morning. You can blow out the cobwebs with the weird jazzy openers “Gone Rogue” and “Last Night” and gradually sink into more conventional songs like “Towards The Dawn” and “Lost Everything”. I will definitely be looking out for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kaitlyn-aurelia-smith-the-kid&quot;&gt;Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith “The Kid”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confession time. I have about two thirds of the album digest for last October sitting on my hard drive doing nothing. It consists of a scathing review of the last album by The Orb and an almost complete review of “Ears” by Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, which ended up being one of my favourite albums of the year. This is along with “Sunergy”, her collaboration with Susanne Ciani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Kid”, which follows on just over a year after “EARS”, is a concept album that follows a child from conception through birth and development, on through to adulthood and death. The track listing almost reads like a poem. It’s the sort of concept for an album that electronic music seems ideally suited to, and so you wonder why so few artists have taken on the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with “Sunergy” there are plenty of beautiful bubbling generative synth sounds and as with “EARS” there are plenty of strange and inventive double-tracked vocal phrases. Much of “EARS” consisted of songs that sounded as though they were written in an invented language, which is what made it so compelling. Once again the songs on “The Kid” often sound like gibberish but at times phrases burst through, perceptible and understandable. In a way, it’s a lot like the moments you experience with young children when the burble of their baby talk suddenly breaks into clearly defined descriptions of wants, needs, feelings and loves. On “A Kid”, Kaitlyn manages to absolutely capture that moment of revelation, and does it in such a way that it could apply to any similar experience of just “getting” something all of a sudden. A reminder then, that our childhood experiences are not something to be lived once, but things to be revisited, as learned techniques for overcoming difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming sensation on “The Kid” is joy. I love the way that “In The World, But Not Of The World” totters just at the edge of control. The way that the pulses and strange animal-like noises of “Who I Am &amp;amp; Why I Am Where I Am” slowly speed up as the track progresses are a delight. It’s wonderful to discover an experimental album that is so celebratory. I haven’t listened to it anywhere near enough. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scala.co.uk/events/kaitlyn-aurelia-smith/&quot;&gt;She’s playing live in London later this month&lt;/a&gt;, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it as it’s a school night. I listened to “EARS” loads, so I think “The Kid” will be on my playlists for some time yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-tet-new-energy&quot;&gt;Four Tet “New Energy”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four Tet is another artist with a rock solid reputation for delivering great albums. Sometimes they can be a bit off-kilter like “Everything Ecstatic” or somewhat functional like “Pink”. His last album consisted of two long pieces that were great to listen to, provided you had the time. Sometimes though, his albums can be revelations like “Beautiful Rewind”, “There Is Love In You” or career highlight (and future understated classic) “Rounds”. I think “New Energy” almost gets there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really grateful to my work colleague Rich who pointed me towards Kieran Hebden’s excellent set on Radio 3’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tp52&quot;&gt;Late Junction&lt;/a&gt;. Kieran (Four Tet) played a wide range of material, explaining that they formed some of the inspirations for the album. I enjoyed the show a lot and it reminded me that Four Tet’s entry in the &quot;DJ Kicks&quot; series is also excellent, and well worth seeking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New Energy” alternates between longer tracks and shorter interludes. Generally the longer tracks are pretty uptempo, much like tracks on “Beautiful Rewind” or “Pink”. Few of the tracks are as club-oriented as those on “Pink”, though the longest track “SW9 9SL” does feel pretty close to the dance floor. I especially like “Lush” (presumably not a cover of the Orbital track) because it performs some clever timing tricks, with a riff that sounds as though it is competing with itself as it repeats. It’s almost like the aural equivalent of an optical illusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the bassier tracks sound great on a car stereo. Unfortunately the wonkier beats made it one of those albums that Ingrid wanted to pass on after a while. I understand that, the repetition that makes for good concentration at work is not the same as that which makes for good concentration while driving. This is much more of an album to have on in the background while you are working. That said, one of the quiet interludes managed to fool me into thinking someone’s phone was ringing. When I took my earphones out to find the source of the ringing, I realised my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere the influence of Indian classical music that was also present on “Morning/Evening” continues in “Daughter”. Of the short interludes, I like the quiet opener “Alap” and the jumbled-up tones of “10 Midi”. They don’t mess up the flow of the album as much as you think they might but I probably enjoyed “New Energy” slightly less than his other great albums precisely because it doesn’t quite flow as well as an album like, say, “There Is Love In You”. That said, there are some really decent tracks here and I can’t wait to hear what remixers make of tracks like “Scientists” or “Lush”. Perhaps there might even be something on the order of Floating Points’ mighty remix of “Sing”. We can but hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rival-consoles-night-melody&quot;&gt;Rival Consoles “Night Melody”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have meant to write about this album for a few months now. You might be able to guess from the cover that it might be a bit dry and abstract. I assume that I also encountered it in my Discover Weekly playlist but &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22148-night-melody/&quot;&gt;maybe it was the glowing 8.0 review from Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt; that got me interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a lovely bit of music. I’ll admit that the first few times I listened to it at night and promptly fell asleep. It’s repetitive and brittle, almost like a mathematical puzzle set to music. In comparison with the Four Tet album it’s colder and more sterile, and I think it’s only since I’ve spent a lot of time with “New Energy” that I’ve also begun to appreciate “Night Melody” a bit more. This kind of abstract sterile music can drive you a bit bonkers if you spend too much time with it, but it tends to be great to have on in the background if you’re attempting to fix a coding problem or even write a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playlist&quot;&gt;Playlist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a Spotify playlist of this month’s albums:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sarah Ladipo Manyika, Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/like-a-mule-bringing-ice-cream-to-the-sun"/>
   <updated>2017-10-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/like-a-mule-bringing-ice-cream-to-the-sun</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun” is a novella by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sarahladipomanyika.com&quot;&gt;Sarah Ladipo Manyika&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the books nominated for the 2016 Goldsmiths Prize, this looked like the most interesting to my eyes. I’ve enjoyed previous Goldsmiths nominated novels including &lt;a href=&quot;acts-of-the-assassins-richard-beard&quot;&gt;Acts of the Assassins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review&quot;&gt;Satin Island&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title comes from a poem by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/mary-ruefle&quot;&gt;Mary Ruefle&lt;/a&gt; called “Donkey On”. You can read it &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegreatnothingof1987.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/donkey-on-by-mary-ruefle.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Like a Mule…” is set in contemporary San Francisco and takes the form of multiple first person narratives, centred around Dr. Morayo da Silva, an elderly Nigerian woman who is approaching her 75th birthday. The novel explores old age, memory, and how we use those things as a filter through which we perceive ourselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this to be an entertaining novella. It’s brief, energetic and exuberant, but while its characters are mostly enjoyable to spend time with, the book as a whole doesn’t really go anywhere. It suggests a wide gamut of possibilities for where the story and its characters might go but none of the opportunities are taken, and the whole thing feels a bit flat by the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters are a global mixture and as such there could be a lot to say about how globalisation has picked many of us up and planted us in strange, new, and/or wonderful places. It could say a lot more about why people move to different countries and start new lives. For some people, it can be a privilege to enter old age in a place far from where one was born, especially if one has the means to build new support networks around oneself. For others, it can be a strange and dislocating experience, particularly when memories diminish and coalesce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author sketches the details of Dr. Morayo’s life, though perhaps we are not as privy to her thoughts and feelings as we might first believe. At one point, she reads some of her writing to another character and then later admits to excising parts of that writing to conceal what we are led to believe are autobiographical events. Even as close to her thoughts as we are, and despite the device of looking at her story repeatedly from the perspectives of other narrators, we can’t necessarily say that we are getting the definitive version of events. This makes the book an intriguing read, you’re never quite sure if things will trip out from under you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I would like to have known more of Dr. Morayo’s back story, which is delivered in small fragments, remembered as needed by the character as she fathoms out her situation. However, we are also given access to the thoughts of her second husband (whom she abandoned), a plot line that is then abandoned. This spidering out of memory in all directions is captivating but when the novella itself fails to resolve by the end, it also feels a little frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what I will remember most from “Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun” is how Sarah Ladipo Manyika has managed to create a living breathing character whose feelings and life experiences you long to explore further. The experiences of black women are under-represented in literature, especially older women, and so I found the character of Dr. Morayo very interesting. Perhaps even more important is that in giving her an open-ended story, we can say that Dr. Morayo’s story is not over because she’s old. In fact, at the end of the book as much as at the start of it, her story is very much just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #36: The Coral by The Coral</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-36"/>
   <updated>2017-10-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-36</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in today’s modern age of streaming and such, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecoral.co.uk&quot;&gt;The Coral&lt;/a&gt; would be a bigger band and may have survived their eventual burnout. Their work ethic was evident from the start, as rumours swirled &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/YdkAAOSwfl9XBSiR/s-l300.jpg&quot;&gt;in the NME&lt;/a&gt; about a fantastic new band from Liverpool who were going to blow everybody’s socks off. I went to see them live in Bristol after they’d released three EPs and they were incredible. Their sound, a bit like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071615/&quot;&gt;the movie “Holy Mountain”&lt;/a&gt; set to pop music, imagined a Merseybeat channelled from an alternative universe in which Lennon and McCartney took their acid in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desertusa.com/mojave-desert.html&quot;&gt;the Mojave desert&lt;/a&gt; rather than in the English suburbs. Yes, it was derivative but somehow it also managed to be utterly new and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the nascent days of the internet it was harder to find new music by bands than it is today. I remember that looking for songs by The Coral on Amazon and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiogalaxy&quot;&gt;Audiogalaxy&lt;/a&gt; became an obsession. Their first single “Shadows Fall” was too rare for me to find a copy. but I managed to find the MP3s and quickly got hooked. Even now copies of “Shadows Fall” go for about £30, which is a little steep for three tracks and eight minutes of music. Two songs from that EP appear on “The Coral”, the title track “Shadows Fall” and “The Ballad of Simon Diamond”. Both seemed to me, recovering from my first bout of depression, like glittering mirages, like songs formed from shadows and left open for the listener to fill in the gaps. “Simon Diamond”, ostensibly about a man who turns himself into a tree by sheer force of will, only has about ten lines of lyrics. Even so, it manages to be about smoking too much weed, ecological angst and the Midas myth, all at once, and in just 158 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kax7S_SX-qk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile “Shadows Fall” is one of my favourite songs of all time. I love its comfortable donkey-ride of a beat, the sort of swaying tune you might associate with a Western or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=mn0106503&quot;&gt;the theme to “Rawhide”&lt;/a&gt;. I also love that it is sung in a Scouse accent. It has a magnificent timelessness to it, something here and then gone, gone, gone. Just like the mysterious stranger stepping through the doors of a dusty saloon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of a (mostly) clear desk, I decided to photograph all my old Coral singles. All of them feature at least one non-album song, and most of them are worth listening to. Many of the singles are easy to obtain: their median price on discogs is around 50p. However, “The Oldest Path EP” is rare and goes for £12. Not as rare as “Shadows Fall” though, see note above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coral’s next release was “The Oldest Path EP” which is a fine collection of songs, though none appear on the first album. The title track is especially good, making its complete absence from any album or compilation mystifying. “God Knows” is a creepy ballad, the kind they’d turn to on their second album but it suffers from rather muffled production on the EP. A new version was recorded for the “Secret Kiss” single a year or two later, but by then it had become something of a dirge. The last two songs are two bedroom experiments, cute little ballads that don’t really go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their next single “Skeleton Key” was much more muscular, the first to be recorded with producer Ian Broudie (from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lightning_Seeds&quot;&gt;Lightning Seeds&lt;/a&gt;). From this point, the arrangements of the songs became much more intricate as they began to record material for their album. Next single “Goodbye” was more mediocre lyrically but still had a catchy chorus and a fine melody. I think by this point I had seen them live &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelouisiana.net&quot;&gt;at the Louisiana in Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, so I knew about many of the tracks that would come along on the album. One of these was “Dreaming of You”, which, like “Shadows Fall”, is one of those perfect pop songs. It’s helped by that naïve bass line that opens the song, and like so many of their songs it’s propelled along by harmony vocals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, the album disappointed me. I’d grown so used to picking up their songs a few at a time from singles that it seemed a lot to take in a whole album of them at once. At the same time, few of the songs that I hadn’t already heard were as good as those that had been singles. Worst of all, their excellent cover of Bob Marley’s “Get Up Stand Up” was relegated to a few lines of outro on a bonus track. This, along with the exclusion of “The Oldest Path”, was a sore point with me for ages. However, when I came back to “The Coral” to listen to it for this post, I found all those memories rushing back and yes, if you pushed me, I’d say the selection of songs is just about right. The problem with Spotify’s version of the album is the absence of the “Time Travel/Get Up, Stand Up” mashup bonus track at the end of “Calendars and Clocks”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned to love this album in the end and particular songs like “Shadows Fall”, “Simon Diamond” and “I Remember When” have added meaning for me. I’d also recommend their third album “The Invisible Invasion”, which was produced by Portishead’s Geoff Barrow. I saw them live again after the release of that album, doing a warm-up for Glastonbury &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatsonbath.co.uk/Theatre%20&amp;amp;%20Cinema/Bath%20Pavilion&quot;&gt;at the Bath Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;. By then, they had so many songs that it was like seeing an established band, not one that had only been around for four years. Crazy stuff and good days!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A trip to Iceland. Part 2: Reykjavík to Flu∂ir.</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-trip-to-iceland-part-2-all-the-waterfalls"/>
   <updated>2017-10-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-trip-to-iceland-part-2-all-the-waterfalls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;iceland-part-one&quot;&gt;After a day on foot in Reykjavík&lt;/a&gt;, and with some trepidation, we returned to the car for our drive through Iceland’s countryside. We started by heading out on route 1, which is like Iceland’s M25 except that it encircles an entire country &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; about thirty times fewer people. We went to house of Nobel Prize winner Halldór Laxness, only to be turned away because it was being renovated and wouldn’t open for another month. Undeterred, we pressed on toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Þingvellir&quot;&gt;Þingvellir&lt;/a&gt;, stopping off on the way to take pictures at a viewpoint. It was just crazy, a flat expanse of undisturbed snow. Just as with the drive from the airport, the territory should have been relentlessly bleak but instead we got a winter wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at Þingvellir we quickly paid our £4 parking fee and began to jostle with the tourists that had recently been decanted from about ten tour buses. It was a bit manic but we managed to take lots of photos. Þingvellir is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the site of Iceland’s first parliament, said to be the oldest in the world. It’s also a place where new land is being created as the Earth’s tectonic plates drift apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the hills, you can see a beautiful old church. Our guidebook advised us to walk there, but it looked pretty treacherous in the snow. Instead we took a walk to Öxaráfoss, the first of many fosses (or waterfalls) that we would encounter in the next few days, though it was the only one that was almost frozen. The walk was chilly and slippery in the snow, but well worth it. The cool crisp air filled our lungs and, even more than had been the case in Reykjavík, we felt as though we were somewhere strange, beautiful, and foreign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at pictures of Þingvellir online while writing this post shows that while we were lucky to see it all covered in snow, it is just as beautiful in the summer. It’s a wonderful place that I would definitely love to go back to. I bet it’s great to walk around during the long twilights of Icelandic summers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we returned to the viewing platform all the day trippers had moved on and we had the sumptuous views pretty much to ourselves. We took some more photos and then set off for our next destination: Geysir. Can you guess what was there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, we’d gone to Geysir for the eponymous geysers. We felt hungry all of sudden, so we decided to investigate the food hall next door. There’s a whiff of motorway service station about it, but it had a decent range of food on offer. We went for the lamb soup, hearty but simple fare that suited Ingrid’s dietary requirements. We also had a wander around the gift shops looking at whimsical and/or beautiful tourist stuff that we couldn’t afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside, we followed the sulphur smells to the geysers. The principal attraction is Strokkur (not to mention the Geysir geyser, but that doesn’t erupt so often and didn’t while we were there) but we took our time to wander around the steaming pools, hoping that the coach trips might disperse as they had done earlier at Þingvellir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our little wander, we stood near to Strokkur and waited for it to erupt, having heard it go several times while we were walking around. Because a geyser is a natural phenomenon, it doesn’t go off like clockwork. Each time the tension builds among the bystanders as they wait. Each time someone screams as the jet of hot water shoots up in to the air. Each time you can’t wait to see it happen again. I’ll admit that it made me jump. Ingrid remained cool and managed to snap pictures of the plume in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left, we lingered by the hot pools and watched clouds of steam drift along the ground in the fading sunlight. It looked like the earth itself were exhaling, warm breath in front of its face in the cool afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_15.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we headed for Gullfoss or the golden waterfall. Our Satnav took us down what seemed like a farm track covered in compressed and compacted snow. It was a bit hairy but we made it. As we walked from the car we could hear the buzz of falling water but in the cold twilight it was surreal when we saw it. A wall of water streaming in all directions that continued down, bifurcating and twisting into new rivulets on the way down. At points it was if it were a vertical river pouring into the centre of the world. Lower down it twisted into a hydra of further torrents exiting one’s view through rocks and snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We held up our cameras and tried to do it justice. High above us and to the left, other crowds stood looking down on us and goodness knows what vertigo-inducing sights they could see up there. From our vantage point midway down, Gullfoss was not so much golden as a cold sliver of writhing whiteness held in the deepening blue-black gloom. Needless to say, our photos did not do it justice. We just stood there, very cold and a little giddy, trying to take it all in. I turned to Ingrid, said “It’s &lt;em&gt;alright&lt;/em&gt; isn’t it?!”, and we laughed. We’d already seen so many beautiful things on our trip so far and this just took the biscuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove to Fluðir on quiet country roads, barely seeing a soul. The little village itself came as something of a surprise, a little smattering of buildings adrift in the hills and caught in the snow. We gratefully checked into the hotel, eagerly awaiting food and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Georgia O'Keeffe at Tate Modern</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/georgia-okeeffe"/>
   <updated>2017-10-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/georgia-okeeffe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We went to see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/georgia-okeeffe&quot;&gt;Georgia O’Keeffe exhibition at the Tate Modern&lt;/a&gt; last year. At the time, I didn’t know much about her, other than the fact she was famous for painting flowers. And that people get a bit hot under the collar about what those paintings might represent. Was the art world of the 1920s and 1930s so repressed that it managed to get into a lather about some paintings of flowers? And more importantly, are they any good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answer to the first question, yes. However this was in part due to the relentless self-promotion of photographer and gallery owner Arthur Stiglitz. Later he would become Georgia O’Keeffe’s husband, but at first, he was the man who seized upon this somewhat dubious &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yonic&quot;&gt;yonic&lt;/a&gt; re-interpretation of flower close-ups. He promoted it relentlessly, and whether it was true or not, it ensured that O’Keeffe’s star was well and truly made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to the second question is also yes. For me, the paintings are aesthetically beautiful. Moreover, I thought they were interesting enough to set aside all the extra semiotics and just appreciate them. With a painting like &lt;em&gt;Grey Lines with Black, Blue and Yellow&lt;/em&gt; (c. 1923), you can see why the fuss was made, but you can also step back and enjoy it as a beautiful piece of abstract art without anyone calling you a letch. Or at least, I hope you can, because we now have it on a magnet on our fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, the idea of finding echoes of human sexuality within flowers is fairly obvious from a biological standpoint. But perhaps in a time with less science education and a greater wariness of female sexuality, this was a potent combination that allowed Stiglitz and O’Keeffe to make a living from their art. The beauty of the exhibition was that it also allowed for O’Keeffe’s other art to be considered, not just those flower paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, there were echoes of &lt;a href=&quot;lichtenstein-at-tate-modern&quot;&gt;the Roy Lichtenstein show&lt;/a&gt;; after all, it took place in the same rooms. For Lichtenstein, the pop works drew massive crowds and you had to jostle for elbow room while viewing them&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The same was true of the rooms with the flower paintings in this show. But as with Lichtenstein, the crowds dispersed as you entered the rooms with the later works. This is great if you are like Ingrid and I, who like to linger over less famous works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the desert paintings, which were as varied as the flower paintings. Adding photographs of the same scenery was a nice touch. The paintings of clouds from above&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; might seem commonplace now we can all snap them on Easyjet, but they nonetheless have an intricate beauty that comes from being filtered through the mind of an artist. The exhibition also had some great photography sections with work by both Stiglitz and O’Keeffe’s long time friend Ansel Adams. This added an extra dimension to the biographical detail throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At least both Lichtenstein and O’Keeffe painted on huge canvasses, the Paul Klee show in 2013 seemed even more crowded because the major works were pretty tiny by comparison. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Flights to Europe inspired O’Keeffe to paint these works. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Alistair Reynolds, Revelation Space</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/revelation-space"/>
   <updated>2017-10-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/revelation-space</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://approachingpavonis.blogspot.co.uk&quot;&gt;Alistair Reynolds’&lt;/a&gt; 2000 novel “Revelation Space” has long been in orbit of my science fiction “to read” list, but it wasn’t until one sleepless night (post &lt;a href=&quot;command-and-control&quot;&gt;“Command and Control”&lt;/a&gt;) that I came across it in Ingrid’s audiobooks. I was instantly drawn in as I listened to the opening scene about an archaeological dig facing evacuation ahead of an imminent ‘razor storm’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Revelation Space” is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hard_sf&quot;&gt;hard sci-fi&lt;/a&gt; set in a universe where the speed of light cannot be exceeded. Most of the action takes place in the 26th century, with the narrative also recounting earlier events as the story progresses. Humanity has expanded to five or six systems beyond our current solar system, using huge colony ships that travel at 99.9% of the speed of light. This means that &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/relativity10.htm&quot;&gt;relativistic effects&lt;/a&gt; play an important role in the narrative. A lot is made of the difference between sleeping away the decades between star systems and subjectively experiencing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially the action takes place in three separate strands&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. One takes place on the planet Resurgam, orbiting the star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universeguide.com/star/deltapavonis&quot;&gt;Delta Pavonis&lt;/a&gt;, which is where the archaeological dig that opens the novel takes place. This introduces us to the central character Dan Sylveste and an AI simulation of the consciousness of his father Calvin. Resurgam is in the process of being terraformed and is essentially a wild west colony. Dan is the colony’s leader, at least he is as the novel opens…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we meet Ilya Volyova&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who is one of a triumvirate of officers controlling the ‘lighthugger’ &lt;em&gt;Nostalgia for Infinity&lt;/em&gt;. The captain is sick with a nanobot infection called the melding plague. Not only that, her gunnery officer is deranged and trying to kill her. The descriptions of the ship are absorbing and finely imagined, much like &lt;a href=&quot;favourite-culture-ship-names&quot;&gt;the ships in Iain M. Banks’ culture novels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thread takes place on a planet called Yellowstone in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://solstation.com/stars/eps-erid.htm&quot;&gt;Epsilon Eridani system&lt;/a&gt;. Yellowstone is one of the earliest post-Earth colonies, though inhospitable conditions mean that little of the planet is colonised. The way the worlds are described and the various adaptations to the geography fired my imagination. The main settlement on the planet is Chasm City&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which was once the height of civilisation. The entire structure of the settlement was once controlled by machines that also fell victim to the melding plague&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In this milieu we meet Ana Khouri, who is a hired assassin involved in Shadowplay - a sport made by the decadent rich of Yellowstone who attempt to avoid their assassin for the set length of a contract. However, not all is what it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed “Revelation Space” and hope to read more books in the series. The world building is absorbing and imaginative, with many parallels to other great works of science fiction. The writing itself is great, full of unusual and evocative descriptions of weird and unknowable phenomena. I think listening to the audiobook made me notice the quality of the writing more and I do wish I had a physical copy that I could mine for quotes. On the other hand, some of the plotting of the story is a little woolly. At some points very obvious things happen and you’re waiting for a particular section to be over, while other points could have been better explained. Perhaps this is again a function of listening to the book rather than reading it, you get more time to think about where things are going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vision for humanity’s future presented by “Revelation Space” is interesting, building on both humanity’s best and worst traits, and the novel itself is about the central question of “what else is out there?” More importantly, it preoccupies itself with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox&quot;&gt;Fermi paradox&lt;/a&gt;: if there should be lots of life out there, why can’t we see any? There are all sorts of possible answers to this question (which is what makes science fiction such an interesting genre) and the one put forward in this novel is certainly entertaining. The novel ends with things still happening, so I look forward to seeing how things develop in the sequels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All of this might seem like spoilers, but I’m only covering what’s in the first two chapters or so. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I love the way that Jon Lee, narrator of the audiobook, pronounces the name &lt;em&gt;Volyova&lt;/em&gt;. I keep repeating the name aloud to myself. A large part of my enjoyment of “Revelation Space” was the excellent audiobook performance. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The subject of the sequel that I will definitely investigate. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So early on you can see the effects of subjective and calendar time at work. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Personal ggplot tips and tweaks</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/personal-ggplot-tips-and-tweaks"/>
   <updated>2017-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/personal-ggplot-tips-and-tweaks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love making plots in R with &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;. However, there are always a few niggles that I forget about between plots. I wrote this post so that I have somewhere to look the next time I need to tweak a few things in my plots. I intend to come back and add updates in the future as I learn more things. If I keep coming back, I might also remember a few of these too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;axis-labels&quot;&gt;Axis labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m always getting caught out by labels. How the heck do I change such and such to a larger font and so on? For most things the &lt;code&gt;theme()&lt;/code&gt; function comes to my rescue. It’s just a matter of remembering all the elements that can be altered. There are so many that there’s no shame in forgetting a few. Thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;the documentation for &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; is great&lt;/a&gt; and it’s easy to find the relevant setting. It’s worth bearing in mind that there are additional helper functions that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; things in &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;. For example, in the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
ggplot(DF, aes(x=my_bars))
	+ geom_bar()
	+ theme_minimal()
	+ xlab(&quot;My x axis&quot;)
	+ ylab(&quot;My y axis&quot;)
	+ theme(
  		axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
  		axis.title = element_text(size = 16))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;axis.text&lt;/code&gt; refers to the axis labels and &lt;code&gt;axis.title&lt;/code&gt; to the axis titles. The &lt;code&gt;element_text()&lt;/code&gt; tells &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; to alter the text. Here we set the size to 16pt but you can also alter the font, the weight, the colour and so on. Another such helper function is &lt;code&gt;element_rect()&lt;/code&gt; to which you can pass properties you want for the background rectangle. See further down this post for an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more source of help is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cookbook-r.com&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cookbook-r.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has lots of practical advice, particularly for all those fiddly legend alterations and custom colourings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;look-and-feel&quot;&gt;Look and feel.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few themes have popped up in recent years as &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; has become almost the default form of R graphics. It’s not essential but I thought I’d share a few of my favourites. From the themes that come with vanilla &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;, my favourite is &lt;code&gt;theme_minimal()&lt;/code&gt; even if it is a little dour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this blog’s current theme I am often using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;ggthemes&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;, in particular &lt;code&gt;theme_tufte()&lt;/code&gt; to match with my jekyll theme. However, I do need to use one of a couple of tricks if I want to use the figures on this blog. One way is to alter the colour of the background to match this site. The other is a transparency trick that I’ll point out later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I also came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://hrbrmstr.github.io/hrbrthemes/&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;hrbrthemes&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;, which also has a neat style using Google’s ubiquitous Roboto Sans font. As an added bonus the package also includes a spellchecker that makes sure you’ve spelt your titles and labels correctly. Check out the examples, they look pretty smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other fun theme packages worth investigating include &lt;a href=&quot;https://ggsci.net&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gg_sci&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (themes based on science journals and science fiction shows) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ricardo-bion/ggtech&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gg_tech&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (themes based on tech companies such as Airbnb). The latter package’s Twitter theme fits well with the colour scheme of the council’s official slide deck so I might use it at work in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exporting-transparent-graphics&quot;&gt;Exporting transparent graphics.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that exporting graphs with coloured backgrounds to match this website is a reasonable workaround but the best approach is to export &lt;code&gt;png&lt;/code&gt; files with transparent backgrounds. A quick search of stackoverflow &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7455046/how-to-make-graphics-with-transparent-background-in-r-using-ggplot2#7455481&quot;&gt;brings up the following commands&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;
p &amp;lt;- p +
  theme(
  	# bg of the panel
    rect = element_rect(fill = &quot;transparent&quot;) 
  )
p

ggsave(p, filename = &quot;tr_tst2.png&quot;,  bg = &quot;transparent&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is a previously created &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;. This approach sees the &lt;code&gt;theme()&lt;/code&gt; function ride to the rescue again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A trip to Iceland. Part 1: Reykjavík.</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-trip-to-iceland-part-1-reykjavik"/>
   <updated>2017-10-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-trip-to-iceland-part-1-reykjavik</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Reykjavík a few days &lt;a href=&quot;https://weather.com/news/news/reykjavik-iceland-record-snowfall-february&quot;&gt;after a monumental snowstorm&lt;/a&gt;. As such the city was still under at least six inches of snow. We collected the hire car from the airport and drove out of Keflavik. The scenery normally looks like a moonscape, but for us it was a frosty white wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about an hour’s drive, we arrived at the Hotel Nattura. From the outside it looks like a huge secondary school but as soon as you step inside it’s warm and comfortable. This is quite good when you’ve just parked next to a snow bank that’s two and half metres tall and then bambi’d it in over the icy paths with your luggage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we got to the hotel as the light was fading, we decided to stay the night at the hotel. Food is expensive in Iceland but at least it was tasty. We hoped forlornly for northern lights and even trekked out into the snow for a while. For a capital city, even one under a massive wad of snow, it sure was quiet. All we could hear was the sound of kids playing indoor football at a sports centre in the distance. Every now and then a small car or bus would pad by. We explored the immediate surrounds of the hotel in giant snowman steps, encountering buried cars and melted-then-remelted snow that had twisted and warped into strange forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we did our best to eat as much as we could at breakfast&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Lots of Skyr, lots of bacon, lots of fruit, lots of pastries. We snagged a free bus pass and rode into town. It was full of tourists and not many other people. We trudged through crunchy snow from the bus station down to the opera house, taking selfies and group photos for other tourists along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wandered in to down town Reykjavík and up the hill to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.hallgrimskirkja.is&quot;&gt;Hallgrimskirkja&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful modern(-ish) church. It’s currently being restored and you can see the battering that the exterior has taken over the years. When you walk in there’s a magnificent tranquillity, even with a guy pounding away at his organ as we went in. We did the tourist thing and queued for the lift to the top. We were rewarded with some fine views of Reykjavík in the sunshine and the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then went for lunch at a creperie at the bottom of the road leading up to the Hallgrimskirkja. We’d spotted it earlier and had noted that it sold gluten free crepes. This was good for Ingrid (and for me, because I love pancakes). Ironically, it was Ash Wednesday and so groups of children came in dressed in fancy dress and sang songs for sweets. It was great fun. The costumes were great and the boy dressed as a Pringles can was my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we went to the modern art museum, because frankly it wouldn’t be a birthday without the chance to take in an art exhibition. It was entertaining but not all that memorable. Ingrid and I had an interesting discussion about what it must be like to be an abstract painter from a nation that only has 300,000 people. You probably end up being &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; abstract painter. And if that’s the case, how do you know if you are any good?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the art museum we wandered down to the dock area again, taking our time slowly through the snowbound streets. We found our way to the Aurora Borealis experience and had a wander around in there. Armed with knowledge we went back to our hotel for another expensive dinner, which was interrupted with a call out to the balcony to look at the northern lights. It was a mere wisp of light that quickly faded. Later on we got a call to our hotel room and went down again to see them. This time a giant arc of green-blue light writhed across the sky looking for all the world like a dragon or the great Midgard serpent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jörmungandr&quot;&gt;Jörmungandr&lt;/a&gt;. The photos we took hardly did it justice. It was a great way to end my birthday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland/iceland_09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After I’d opened my birthday presents! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. G. Ballard, Hello America</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/hello-america"/>
   <updated>2017-10-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/hello-america</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had low expectations for “Hello America”, the next in &lt;a href=&quot;j-g-ballard&quot;&gt;the series of Ballard novels&lt;/a&gt; that I started reading over seven years ago. However, it turned out to be a hoot. A couple of years ago, this novel would have been a wig-out bit of standard Ballard weirdness (a bit like &lt;a href=&quot;the-drowned-world&quot;&gt;“The Drowned World”&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;the-crystal-world&quot;&gt;“The Crystal World”&lt;/a&gt;) but given recent events “Hello America” is starting to take on an eerie prescience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello America” (1981) is set a hundred years from now in an alternate time-line where oil production peaked in the late sixties. Without a viable energy supply the North American continent depopulates and the Russians dam the Bering strait in order to turn Siberia into farmland to feed the American refugees. Meanwhile, the continental United States turns into a desert wasteland due to the resulting climate change. The 44th president (President Brown) was the last before America depopulated entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel opens with an expedition arriving in New York. Believing stories of a new gold rush, the crew are initially excited by the golden shimmer from the shoreline. However when their captain, the inscrutable Steiner, runs them aground (having hit the submerged Statue of Liberty on the way in) there is disillusionment when they discover that it’s all just sand and that New York is just a wasteland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On horseback and with a water purification trailer, the team head inland, discovering tribes of new American natives: nomadic peoples who never left the states. The landscape is one of cars submerged in sands, towering cacti and drained swimming pools (so many drained swimming pools). The story combines the landscape transformation elements of &lt;a href=&quot;the-drought&quot;&gt;“The Drought”&lt;/a&gt;, the weird-leader-with-hidden-agenda from “The Drowned World”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the themes of urban abandonment explored in &lt;a href=&quot;crash&quot;&gt;“Crash”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;concrete-island&quot;&gt;“Concrete Island”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;high-rise&quot;&gt;“High-Rise”&lt;/a&gt;. Ballard’s trick here is his usual one: end the world and make people live with it. There’s a reason for this, rooted in the novel he’d write next, but we’ll save discussing that for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the story is told through the eyes of Wayne - a young man who stowed away with the expedition in search of his long-lost American father. Wayne is in rapture to ancient copies of Time magazine and completely in thrall to the idealised yet long-lost space-age vision of America. Much of the story centres on Wayne grappling with the American dream and what it has become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the expedition nearly dies out in the middle of the desert before the ‘Indians’ rescue them and take them to Las Vegas in a coal-powered car. As they cross the Rockies they find that the Amazon jungle has spread northwards. Arriving at Las Vegas, they discover that the lights are on and a new American nation is germinating in the mangroves. This enterprise is led by a charismatic but sinister madman - President Manson - who is obsessed with nuclear weapons&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/donald-trump-says-hes-a-germaphobe-as-he-dismisses-salacious-allegations.html&quot;&gt;a self-confessed ‘germophobe’&lt;/a&gt; and, I kid you not, wants to make America “great again”. You can see now why “Hello America” held my attention. Ballard has Manson, who we later find out is named for Charles Manson, as the 45th president of his fictional United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climactic chapters of the novel involve battles in the streets of Las Vegas, which is also made spookier by recent events. Needless to say, there’s plenty here to chew on. When I started reading this series of novels I imagined that “Hello America” would just be ‘the one after &lt;a href=&quot;unlimited-dream-company&quot;&gt;“The Unlimited Dream Company”&lt;/a&gt;’ with a crazy plot that didn’t make sense&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While the writing is not Ballard’s best, there are many points that are repetitive while other parts of the plot are inconsistent or don’t make sense. It’s focussed on an outsider’s vision of the US in such a way that I doubt it made much sense even at the time it was written, let alone now. That said, it barrels along with short chapters and plenty of action. In many ways it’s more like an idea for a short story stretched too thin over the length of a novel. I read a chapter aloud to Ingrid each evening. She didn’t tell me to stop (though she did regularly fall asleep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, at least real life events give us a reason to go back and re-read “Hello America”. &lt;a href=&quot;http://deadline.com/2017/05/netflix-jg-ballard-hello-america-ridley-scott-sci-fi-novel-1202095982/&quot;&gt;You might also be able to watch an adaptation on Netflix soon&lt;/a&gt;. Updated and given a modern twist, it might prove to be provocative but entertaining viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is Ballard’s true masterpiece, the novel that all the previous ones lead to: “Empire of the Sun”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Who am I kidding? It’s a motif in pretty much all of Ballard’s novels. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reading this at the same time as I was finishing &lt;a href=&quot;command-and-control&quot;&gt;&quot;Command and Control&quot;&lt;/a&gt; was also a bit weird. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which is really saying something after the “The Unlimited Dream Company”. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>The same, but different</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-same-yet-different"/>
   <updated>2017-10-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-same-yet-different</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I got married a month ago. It was a lovely day. We had a simple ceremony with two witnesses, our friends Sue and Andrew. We kept it quiet and small, as we just wanted to be married without too much fuss. A month on, we’re happy to report that we are glad we did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank everyone who nonetheless sent cards and gifts, and to all of those who wished us well on Facebook. Much as I’m wary of social networks this did seem to be one of those events to which an announcement on Facebook was well suited. We intend to have additional celebrations at some point in the near future so keep your eyes peeled. We’re aware that our little dyad cannot be the only point where our families intersect. We hope to overcome that, but it is those sorts of complications that drove us to a smaller scale event in the first place. I’m very keen on the ‘win the lottery and hire a few private jets’ approach but they keep selling me faulty tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our marriage, like most, is an affirmation of the fact we get along well. We’re a team that enjoys life together in the ways that suit us best. So when people ask how married life is, I say that it is wonderful. Not in a sarcastic way, but simply because it was wonderful to share my life with Ingrid before we got ‘hitched’. So it feels the same. The same, but different.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, September 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-09-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Note: Recent months have been very busy, so this album digest combines a review of the new album by The National with a couple of reviews left over from earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written a few more album reviews in the past months but I’m so far behind (February and March have already been published on a considerable lag) that I’m just going to pepper forthcoming digests with additional reviews of older albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-national-sleep-well-beast&quot;&gt;The National “Sleep Well Beast”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National are one of my favourite bands. Up until this album, they would release a great album every two years. However four years have passed since 2013’s “Trouble Will Find Me”. Not that you would know it from the opening pair of “Nobody Else Will Be There” and “The Day I Die”. The first is a slow burner, creeping in like “Terrible Love” on “High Violet” but without that song’s eventual pyrotechnics. It’s a song about wanting to get to a party early so that you can leave the party early. It seems as though The National have aged in the same way I have. On the other hand, “The Day I Die” is about as poppy as they’ve ever deigned to be. It’s a simple and catchy song, and, as it it turns out, it’s a palette cleanser for the more experimental fare to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Walk It Back” stretches three song fragments over six minutes. A twitchy riff and a detached vocal line (mostly just the title) dominate the opening minutes, before a spoken word and found footage collage takes over. The track closes with a beautiful instrumental interlude with another of The National’s highly underrated string arrangements. “Walk It Back” also manages to bleed into lead single “The System Only Dreams In Total Darkness” without too much fuss. It’s a mid-tempo song that descends into squally guitar riffs, it sounds National-like but without being cliché. You can say the same for “Born To Beg” in which a languid vocal lolls over an insistent yet delicate beat but in keeping with their new sound, it also gets a bit fuzzy in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is “Turtleneck” which is the most raucous song The National have produced since “Mr November”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That song was about the disillusionment the band felt at the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004. You can guess who this one’s about. It’s a song of bitter disappointment rather than anger, full of pithy lines about politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this there are three more beat-driven tracks. “Empire Line” is one of those songs that The National write effortlessly, a sort of cross between “Green Gloves” and “Fake Empire”. It even has a touch of auto tune. “I’ll Still Destroy You” is the best song on the album, with another drawn out ending like “Walk It Back” but this time with a clatter of drums and an epic string arrangement that somehow manages to cut through in between, like shafts of sunlight through clouds or overhead lights on the motorway. “Guilty Party” features perhaps the glitchiest musical backdrop and a lyric that reminds me of “Pink Rabbits” from “Trouble Will Find Me”. It also reminds me of when I saw them live in 2007 and they did “About Today” (one my favourite songs ever), expanding it to over eight minutes with a crazy  drummer jam at the end of the lyric. I love how The National’s amazing rhythm section makes tracks like these seem completely effortless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards there are two slightly more straightforward songs, “Carin at the Liquor Store” and “The Dark Side of the Gym”. The former is another “Pink Rabbits” style ballad full of self-deprecation and word games. The latter initially sounds a bit like the opening of “Dark Side of the Moon” but it turns out that the title does indeed come out of the content of the lyrics - “I’m gonna keep you in love with me… for a while…”. Once again, they deliver a completely new and modern kind of love song in the vein of “Mistaken For Strangers” or “Karen”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last track is the title track, which for me is the only disappointment. Another twitchy track that resembles “I’ll Still Destroy You” but doesn’t quite work for me. Perhaps it will given a bit more time. Tucked away as it is right at the end of the album, I haven’t given it too much consideration so far. At the moment, it just feels like a weird bonus track or remix. Nevertheless “Sleep Well Beast” (the album) is well worth a listen and is full of songs that will sit well in any playlist of great songs by this band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nelly-furtado-the-ride&quot;&gt;Nelly Furtado “The Ride”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new album from Nelly Furtado follows on from “The Spirit Indestructible” and “Mi Plan”, both of which I liked. I noted in &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-september-2012&quot;&gt;my review of &lt;em&gt;The Spirit Indestructible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was all over the shop. The only version of it on Spotify now is the deluxe edition, a hot mess that confuses quantity for quality. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-january-2013/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi Plan&lt;/em&gt; was a nice tack back to ‘proper’ song writing&lt;/a&gt; but it wasn’t successful enough to warrant a sustained change of direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of Nelly Furtado and her music. I think that “Whoah Nelly!” and “Folklore” are both really great albums, choosing the latter as &lt;a href=&quot;uc20&quot;&gt;an understated classic&lt;/a&gt;. Each album differs a little from the last so she seems to grow with each step. She’s also been judicious with her choice of collaborators. These have been distinctive enough for her to raise her game without overwhelming her identity. “The Ride” is self-released and features no collaborators save for a new producer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Congleton&quot;&gt;John Congleton&lt;/a&gt;, who has worked on albums by St. Vincent and Goldfrapp among many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first listened to “The Ride” on headphones and hated it. The new production style is hostile to headphone listening. I found this a surprise because so much music is now geared toward headphone listening. Moreover, given that this album is meant to be a return to more personal song writing it seems silly to make it so awful to listen to on headphones. If you’re aiming for intimacy and feeling, why layer the songs in such gimmicky and prickly production?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the best thing about “The Ride” (and it’s not much of a win) is that it doesn’t quite sound as awful out loud. However, the songs themselves indicate that this album may be one reinvention too many. If you want a Doctor Who reference - and who doesn’t? - this is her Colin Baker album. It has moments where the material transcends the presentation and it’s not so awful as to suggest that future incarnations will be as bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take “Cold Hard Truth” and “Pipe Dreams” for example. These are objectively great songs. In fact the former wears the new production so well that maybe this was what convinced Nelly to run with it. It’s punchy and marries well with its subject matter. “Pipe Dreams” echoes “Explode” from “Folklore”, telling the story from an older, more jaded, angle. Again the production doesn’t wave around unnecessarily and there is also a wonderful spooky video to accompany the song on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album is okay, provided you don’t listen on headphones. The trouble is that none of it is going to set the world alight. That’s a shame because she’s been brave enough to self-release an album that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; experiment and innovate. The problem is that some experiments do end in failure. This is one of those. The big question is what happens next? I hope she carries on regardless: grows a little, changes a bit and keeps on singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goldfrapp-sliver-eye&quot;&gt;Goldfrapp “Sliver Eye”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From one album to another, Goldfrapp slalom between sleepy pastoral idylls and futuristic sexy techno pop. On “Silver Eye” they once again make this transition, opting for a noisy bravura sound following the gentle strings and croons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-september-2013/&quot; title=&quot;Album Digest September 2013, featuring a review of &amp;quot;Tales of Us&amp;quot; by Goldfrapp.&quot;&gt;2013’s “Tales of Us”.&lt;/a&gt; I said of the last album:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…if “Tales of Us” proves anything, it’s that there will be no nicer place for Goldfrapp to graze out their dotage than on the foothills of Felt Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well as it happens there’s plenty more glitter balls and white horses in the band yet. &lt;em&gt;Silver Eye&lt;/em&gt; is a mostly sparkly and stompy return to form. Unlike the last uptempo Goldfrapp album “Head First” which played things pretty straight, this album contains some songs that are downright peculiar and it’s all the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead single “Anymore” sticks to the template for Goldfrapp singles by songs like “Number 1” and “Ooh La La”, though there’s something squelchy low in the mix that gradually overtakes the song as it progresses. Joe Goddard’s remix on the 12” is even better, it’s very much the Dr. Hyde to the album version’s Mr. Jekyll. On the album, the de facto title track “Systemagic” also succumbs to this transformation, it’s a rollicking beast almost dripping with bass lines. It’s a fissile song, one that’s about ten seconds from corroding through your speakers. It’s also insanely catchy, which always helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tigerman” returns to “Felt Mountain”-type material, channelling “Lovely Head”. It’s also got these weird whooshy bits that seem to throw themselves around your speakers  and on headphones it produces a disorienting effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a first for Goldfrapp, “Become The One” is almost entirely spoken word. The lyric has a Laurie Andersen feel but also reminds me a little bit of “Happiness” and “Clowns” from “The Seventh Tree”. This might be another track that responds well to remixes. “Faux Suede Drifter” pulses and drifts for five minutes, a weird little torch song. I love the way it picks up just after the three minute mark, it’s very eighties - sounding a bit like the atmospheric bits of Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With You”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Zodiac Black” begins like a folk song, it could almost like a leftover from “Tales of Us” or a song that would have sat well on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-march-2017/&quot; title=&quot;March's album digest features a review of &amp;quot;Brazil&amp;quot; by JFDR.&quot;&gt;JFDR’s “Brazil” in March&lt;/a&gt;. I really like the way that the atmospherics hiss behind the lyrics like misty moonlight. Unfortunately, while the song always feels like a moment of catharsis is coming, what ultimately arrives is disappointing. The song doesn’t really go anywhere. This seems to be a problem with the majority of the tracks on “Silver Tree”: they’re good but they don’t really amount to much. In the end songs like “Moon in Your Mouth” and “Ocean” and the others already discussed sound like the more forgettable tracks that will be scraped for another greatest hits comp in a few years’ time. I really wanted to like this album, but in the final analysis it’s good but not great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Mr November is the first song I ever heard by The National. I was in Moles nightclub in Bath and I even went up to the DJ to ask what the song was. I bought a copy of “Alligator” that weekend and was hooked. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The same approach was successful for St. Vincent on her self-titled album precisely because she was singing about the alienating experiences of our increasingly digital lifestyles. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Eric Schlosser, Command and Control</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/command-and-control"/>
   <updated>2017-09-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/command-and-control</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Command and Control” by Eric Schlosser is about the history of nuclear weapons and their safety. This might not seem like a thrilling subject, but it’s absorbing from start to finish. I started it three years ago but only finished it more recently as the subject of nuclear weapons has become more pertinent to current affairs&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There are many people who would stand to gain a great deal from reading this book&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schlosser manages to make the subject so absorbing by weaving together the history of nuclear weapons, the history of nuclear weapon safety, and the tale of one particular event involving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Damascus_Titan_missile_explosion&quot;&gt;the explosion of a Titan II missile at a silo in Arkansas in 1980&lt;/a&gt;. By doing so, he gives the reasons why nuclear weapons were so often unsafe, he gives us examples of how things went wrong, and he shows how on that September day in Damascus, everything that could go wrong did go wrong. It’s a story that takes in an incredible range of characters. Some are well known to the reader, such as the various presidents of the USA, Nikita Khrushchev, Henry Kissinger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airplanesofthepast.com/strategic-air-command-movie.htm&quot;&gt;Jimmy Stewart (bizarrely)&lt;/a&gt; and so on. Others less well known include the scientists at the various laboratories, airmen, top brass at Strategic Air Command. The story also takes in locations all over the United States and around the world, such as Japan, Greenland, and Spain. There are mind-boggling stories of radar systems, advanced computers, and site R, the city-sized nuclear bunker built into Raven Rock mountain in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout, despite telling some stories that could only be as strange as they are by virtue of being true, the tone remains measured. Schlosser does not resort to rhetoric and never allows the subject matter to overwhelm the writing. He tells the stories of ordinary airmen in a sympathetic and natural way. The complexity of the weapons is contrasted to the rote nature of the tasks of the maintenance men. He describes the absurdity of the situation with the missile in a detached manner, almost befitting of a sequel to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-dr-strangelove-1964&quot;&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/a&gt;. The way Schlosser describes them, it’s hard not to become attached to the men caught at the scene in Damascus. The details of how supposed command and control instead becomes a game of Chinese whispers between men on walkie talkies talking to men on the radio who are talking on a conference call made me gasp. In the descriptions of historical incidents, it’s one face-palm incident after another. This quote sums up the scale of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The military now used Native American terminology to categorize nuclear weapon accidents. The loss, theft, or seizure of a weapon was an Empty Quiver. Damage to a weapon, without any harm to the public or risk of a detonation, was a Bent Spear. And an accident that caused the unauthorized launch or jettison of a weapon, a fire, an explosion, a release of radioactivity, or a full-scale detonation was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115759/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;Broken Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. The official list of nuclear accidents, compiled by the Department of Defense and the AEC, included thirteen Broken Arrows. Bill Stevens read reports that secretly described a much larger number of unusual events with nuclear weapons. And a study of abnormal environments commissioned by Sandia soon found that &lt;strong&gt;at least 1,200 nuclear weapons had been involved in “significant” incidents and accidents between 1950 and March 1968.&lt;/strong&gt; (page 327)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also recommend the audio-book, as read by Scott Brick. This helped me get through it a bit faster. I’ve been snooty about audio-books in the past, but I found it helped me stick to a schedule of reading chapters, usually to re-cap where I fell asleep listening to it at night. It was also good to listen to on the way to and from work in fifteen minute snippets. On one occasion I listened to a section about the US army, the US air force and the US navy all planning to bomb the same targets in Russia many times over. I don’t think anything else I’ve listened to on the way to work has provided so much insight into how the council works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I should also re-mention “Gods of Metal”. This is a tangent from “Command and Control”. &lt;a href=&quot;gods-of-metal&quot;&gt;I wrote it about two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. This picks up on the nuclear protest movement, something that is almost absent from “Command and Control”. Presumably it was assembled from material that didn’t make it into the original book. Like “Command and Control” it’s able to discuss one issue as a subtext for another, highlighting an aspect of weapons safety more pertinent to current events: is it safe for nuclear weapons to be guarded by private contractors who were the lowest bidder? I recommend “Gods of Metal” again too, especially if a 632 page tome on nuclear weapons seems a little too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Suffice to say that when I bought the book over three years ago, I would not have believed that it would be so much more relevant by the time I had finished it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The name at the top of the list rhymes with Dump. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>A little trip to Italy</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-little-trip-to-italy"/>
   <updated>2017-09-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-little-trip-to-italy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We bought a cheap package holiday in the British Airways Black Friday sale. The weekend spanned Ingrid’s birthday, so it was ideal. £99 each for flights and a hotel, and we bagged a hire car quite cheaply too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our flight was from Heathrow and the trains from Chichester are both expensive and inconvenient for early flights, we spoiled ourselves with a taxi to the airport. It felt very strange to be whisked through the Sussex and Surrey countryside at six am on a Friday morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We picked up our little hire car. There were snow chains in the boot and we hoped we wouldn’t have to use them. Ingrid set to understanding the mind boggling experience of driving on the right hand side of the road. I set to understanding the mind boggling experience of navigating on the right hand side of the road. It took us three circuits to get out of the multistory car park. After that though, it was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pootled along the motorway from Milan to Bergamo, and then on to the little town just outside Bergamo where we would stay. We settled in to our room and went for an exploratory walk. We found a pizza place that catered to Ingrid’s allergy to both gluten and to tomatoes. Pizza bianca! (Literally, white pizza!) Just as well, because there was no way that I wasn’t going to eat pizza in Italy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/italy/Italy_01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home we stopped off at the Gelato shop. There were almost too many options but we managed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/italy/Italy_02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, our only full day, we set out to Lake Iseo in the car. We got to see lots of the countryside, stopping on the way to buy some lunch and more &lt;em&gt;senza glutine&lt;/em&gt; products. The surrounding hills were beautiful and the lake itself was just gorgeous. We stopped off for lunch in Sarnico, a sleepy town next to the lake. We drank tea and coffee and played Lost Cities in a Phileas Fogg themed cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/italy/Italy_03a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/italy/Italy_03b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/italy/Italy_05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this we drove on to Iseo, parked the car, and went for a walk alongside the lake. It was cold (there had been a week of heavy snow prior to our arrival) but with the sun just low in the sky, it was the perfect light for taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/italy/Italy_04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/italy/Italy_06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove to a different airport, Malpensa, with Ingrid ever-increasing in confidence on the Italian motorways. We made good time and had plenty of time to return the car and have a good look around the airport. It was a brief visit but we really enjoyed it. We could have booked another hotel in Milan and stayed there for the weekend, which is what we might do next time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #35: Snivilisation by Orbital</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-35"/>
   <updated>2017-09-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-35</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came late to Orbital’s work. I knew of them through a few remixes and because as a mad Orb fan, they could not have avoided my notice could they? Apart from that, one of my college friends tried to get me into “In Sides” just after its release in 1996. The same friend got me into &lt;a href=&quot;uc11&quot;&gt;“Second Toughest In The Infants” by Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot now understand the reason, but “In Sides” just left me cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Snivilisation” precedes “In Sides”. Released in 1994, it is their third album. I got my hands on a copy about thirteen years later. Ten years ago, in 2007, I lived in a house in Bath with my landlord. One day she leaned in to the doorway of my room, listening to the music I was playing. It was &lt;a href=&quot;uc13&quot;&gt;something by the Orb&lt;/a&gt;, or it might have been &lt;a href=&quot;uc6&quot;&gt;the Shamen’s “Arbor Bona Arbor Mala”&lt;/a&gt;, and she said “the guy who used to live here liked music like that.” She explained that he left some of his CDs behind and that they were in the attic if I was interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well dear reader, my reward for overcoming my immense fear of ladders was to find a stash of about 10 CDs of mid-90s dance and indie music in the attic, perched on one of the roof struts. Three of them were by Orbital (“Snivilisation”, “In Sides” and “Times Fly”). I do not remember what the others were, probably stuff by the Chemical Brothers and some ropy compilations. Some of the other albums I already had, but two of the Orbital albums were new to me. I also took an interest in the Greatest Hits of the Stone Roses but the CD wouldn’t rip .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, “Snivilisation” is the sound of a band waiting to go mainstream: an inflection point where great tunes, command of their equipment and artistic vision all combine to produce a great album. It’s the sound of a band who had made great tunes (for example, Chime and Halcyon) putting all those elements together. For all the hair-raising catchiness of their early singles, their first two albums, both called “Orbital” but referred to by everyone as the green and brown albums, were rather scattershot affairs. By adding elements of rock music to an already heady mix of trance and techno, “Snivilisation” sees Orbital taking a massive leap forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding rock elements (i.e. samples of guitars) to dance music happened lots in 1994. Six weeks before the release of “Snivilisation”, The Prodigy released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/2bvr/&quot;&gt;“Music For The Jilted Generation”&lt;/a&gt;, an album that also incorporated rock samples on tracks like “Voodoo People” and “Poison”. The funny thing is I had a cassette copy of “Jilted Generation” soon after its release, but never heard “Snivilisation” at all. I remember hearing “Are We Here?” in the charts but, even though I loved The Orb’s “Blue Room”, I thought it sounded thin. I found a copy of the single online while writing this review: how wrong I was! It goes to show how the choice of singles can make or break an album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Snivilisation” is spiky and rude. In keeping with the time of its release it’s furious about the state of the world. The parallels between 1994 and 2017 are obvious: a country stagnating under a failing tory government and a right wing press stomping all those who oppose it into submission. The hot topic back then was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994&quot;&gt;Criminal Justice Bill&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to prevent mass raves; something the burgeoning dance music scene saw as an attempt to curtail artistic expression. As a result the album is as much an artefact of social history as it is one of electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that drew me to “Snivilisation” in 2007 was the way it explores the relationship between people and technology. The cover is a walkman distorted into a cartoon character shape over a banal grey background. The cover of the “Are We Here?” single is Jesus wearing an old-school Virtual Reality helmet. Several of the tracks are collage pieces that overlay concerns about technology with old world concerns. On “I Wish I Had Duck Feet”, a carnival barker exhorts viewers to see his freak show while additional samples whisper about plastic surgery. Opener “Forever” slices and dices a rant about the inequities and iniquities of capitalism in such a way it’s impossible to date the sample. Is the ranter talking about the 1990s and the 1960s, or the 1890s and the 1860s? I guess the point made is that it doesn’t matter. The excellent “Philosophy by Numbers” riffs on the weird adverts you used to see for home-based learning in the early 90s. It sounds dated now though, what with the internet and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Snivilisation”’s excellent first half uses the collage tracks to augment ”Crash and Carry”, a raucous techno number, and “Sad But True”, which is one of two tracks that feature Alison Goldfrapp. Appearances on albums by Orbital and Tricky that paved the way for the success of Goldfrapp’s “Felt Mountain”. In 1994 she seemed to be on almost every half decent record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of “Snivilisation” begins with “Klein Trink Wasser” which interweaves piano samples to form a wonderful meta-riff that feels like it’s dropped out of a 33 1/3 RPM recording of a Mozart piece played at 45RPM. Almost three minutes in the techno begins but the tune never shakes those pianos, which come rattling in whenever things sag. At points, check out the seesawing synth line that enters at 3:58, it sounds like early Kraftwerk, which might explain the title. Next up comes “Quality Seconds”, a two minute smash-and-grab that throws thrash metal shapes while also sounding like a CD skipping. To finish, we get a fifteen minute version of “Are We Here?” (more Alison Goldfrapp vocals) and the twelve and a half minute “Attached”. This third of the runtime contains the nucleus of the ideas and styles that Orbital explore in their subsequent albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Are We Here?” single features four remixes of note, along with a version entitled “Criminal Justice Bill?” that is just four minutes of silence, and a radio edit. It is tempting to look at the single and its remixes as a prism splitting “Are We Here?” (and by extension “Snivilisation”) into other forms it could have taken. Of particular interest is “Do They Here?”, which crumples the track down into something metallic and industrial. I wrote at length about how rocky “Snivilisation” is but those elements don’t appear as often as I remember. The murky industrial funk of “Do They Here?” suggests a much darker version of the album could have been on the cards. I also find it interesting that the album version of “Are We Here?” contains sections of what might be called proto-Jungle, yet these loops are not significantly developed on any of the remixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Attached” floats, squelches and drifts along. On headphones, it has a strong presence, with a low synth line that pulses through most of the run time. When I played it to Ingrid through our TV the other day that same synth line seeped away and the whole track sounded different, floating somehow. I love music that changes like this and as a result, the soft throbs of “Attached” make it my favourite track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I commend this album to your ears dear readers. It sounds both of its time and of any time. It makes time pass in unusual and interesting ways. Even now, ten years after I first heard it (and 23 years after I first should have heard it), I hear new things within it. I urge you to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Valleys</title>

   <updated>2017-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/valleys</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I wrote about hills. I tried to use them as a metaphor to explain nagging sense of incompletion when you single out one activity over another. The feeling that there’s always a more exciting hill off in the distance to go climb, instead of the one you’re on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said my next post would be about how to pick between different options, particularly when you have many to choose from. This post is not that. This is a short piece about an experience I had in South America that relates to the hills post: about contentment in the moment and letting things go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the Inca Trail in Peru (December 2013) we marched along as a happy band. The foothills were easy to cope with and the weather was great. The course of antibiotics I’d started back in Cuzco was taking effect and I was feeling better than I had in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-afternoon we stopped for a while on a saddle in the hills. The pathway upward led us onward for the rest of the day’s walking, while down in the valley below, as our guide explained, there was another fascinating Inca ruin. He told us that the trail was so important to the Inca because it connected all these large settlements along the route. It was the beautiful remains of a stone town, laid out as an archeological curiosity. I stood there wondering about who built it and what their lives must have been like. I thought about how far I was from London and how different my life was from the people who lived down there in that valley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a moment of clarity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What also dawned on me at this point was the knowledge that this was the closest I would get to that town. I peered down and took a photo. Maybe two or three. Until then, I’d been very much “see all the things”, “do all the things”. I was Inca-mad. Until that day, the realisation I wouldn’t see any more of the town would have saddened me. But there, looking down and reflecting as I was, it didn’t seem to matter. I didn’t need to hang on to the idea of going down to see it. There were other things to do, other hills to climb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is not that promised insight into how to choose your battles, obsessions, reading material, or Netflix series. It’s just a moment where I was album to let go of that “next hill’s better” attitude and keep climbing the hill I was on. Sure, being part of a group meant I had no real say in the matter, but I could choose not to pout and throw myself into the next section of the walk. And the funny thing is that I now remember that valley far more than I otherwise might have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up: rivers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hills</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/hills"/>
   <updated>2017-07-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/hills</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of books. The way they transport you away to other places and so on. As repositories of knowledge and adventure they can’t be beat. I can think of no better way out of an existential fix than reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is I tend to hoard them. I’ve posted pictures of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattischrome.com/reading-list-mid-april-2012/&quot;&gt;book stacks before&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mattischrome.com/another-reading-list/&quot;&gt;on more than one occasion&lt;/a&gt;). I could probably repeat that every month if I wanted to, perhaps even more often. I’ve always been a networked thinker, able to see (at least superficially) the connections between all sorts of things. Because of this I get excited and enthusiastic about all kinds of things, and I want to learn them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My motto: learn all the things. If only I had some sort of heraldic crest below which those words could float on a trompe l’oeil fluttering scroll. I can picture it now: a Bear rampant on yellow and black quarters, above a scroll featuring the words &lt;em&gt;omnia scire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the problem with always wanting to learn new things is that you might not learn anything. There’s always something better, newer and shinier over the hill. It’s a perverse kind of perfectionism: in wanting to be the best and know the most, you end up underestimating the work involved in what you want to learn. As part of my PhD I learned that sometimes there is no scenic route up to those hills and sometimes you have drudge on in order to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is less exciting. There isn’t much shiny or new-seeming about the word drudge. It’s boring. That’s partly why the “next” new thing seems so exciting by comparison. And this whole process doesn’t just manifest in fun things like learning programming languages or techniques for statistical inference, but also on the micro scale in the horrors of admin minutiae and email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just because I know something, it doesn’t necessarily mean I put that knowledge to use. We always remember the view and not the walk up the hill. Well apart from that time in the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which is very much a memory of the climb thanks to a mini panic attack but that’s a whole other story. The point here is that knowing that the reality is boring and knowing how that boredom will probably deflect me on to attempting something else doesn’t really prevent it from happening. So what do you do? Well…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want hear about something else that’s boring? The single most boring sentence in the whole English language? Ready? “Let’s make sure these are SMART objectives ok?” There are variations but pretty much any sentence that invokes the SMART acronym is a crime against sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not really. Despite the fact that I have to break up recalling what the acronym actually stands for into two sessions (divided by a quick espresso) in order to avoid falling into a sweet unproductive sleep, it is a pretty sensible set of guidelines for managing your expectations about any kind of goal, objective or project. It might be boring, but for the sake of your sanity it pays to be SMART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That involves making sure that goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable… (Sorry, hang on, I have to go and look this up…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;☕ 💤 ☕ ☕&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… Realistic and Time-bound. Of course, it’s hard to be SMART in bookshops when confronted with so many lovely books and the different ideas contained within them. Though I’m often a decent judge of which books should be read, this still leaves me with too many to read. That’ll be the subject of my next post: how on Earth do I pick what needs to be done next?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Wonder Woman: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/wonder-woman-short-review"/>
   <updated>2017-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/wonder-woman-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Wonder Woman, which came as a surprise to me given my growing distaste for superhero movies. &lt;a href=&quot;man-of-steel-a-short-review&quot;&gt;I can remember seeing the Superman reboot Man of Steel&lt;/a&gt; with its phallic rockets and its boring boring fight sequences. But almost everything about Wonder Woman exceeded my expectations. It’s a well-made superhero movie and better still, it gets to the heart of why these kinds of movies matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas Man of Steel ended up levelling cities and criminally underusing Amy Adams, all while giving us no stake on why Superman even matters as a man or a hero, Wonder Woman focusses tightly on its main character and explains what matters to her, and in turn the movie then explains why she should matter to us. In other words, it’s not boring and it’s not pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a complete reverse on many recent superhero movies. In Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies, the titular character has an arc more concerned with vengeance and petty squabbles than with saving people or making their lives better. I get that those movies are also about the complexities and burdens of being a hero, but even so, show us why we’re here! Sure Batman gets to stop a lot of bad stuff going down, but who cares if the Scarecrow manages to take over Arkham or Bane manages to isolate Gotham from the world? In The Dark Knight, the Joker only cares about beating Batman and Batman only cares about beating the Joker. There’s nothing in three whole movies about how ordinary people are affected, nothing in it for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a movie Wonder Woman concerns itself with showing how deeply invested Diana is in helping humanity. She understands her responsibilities toward humanity and thanks to some good old fashioned storytelling at the start of the movie, so do we. Her beliefs get challenged and we as an audience are often asked whether we believe in what is going on. Is she really fighting a god, or is she taking down some bad Germans? It’s good that you are kept guessing about this for quite a substantial portion of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a movie that will get even the most stone-hearted among you behind Diana and willing her to win. Not just for her sake, but for the sake of all the characters we meet in the movie. To paraphrase one of the characters, it’s not about whether humanity deserves this intervention but whether Diana has enough love to make it happen anyway. Obviously that is something that resonates with my core beliefs. It’s refreshing to see a movie with values where you root for the main character because she’s believable and credible - even though she’s whipping around a lasso made of glow sticks and dodging oncoming machine gun fire. You will leave the movie wanting to believe that she exists!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also leave the movie believing in something more plausible: that the message of responsibility and the call to action can live within you. Diana, in her gilded secret paradise, chooses to leave in order to fight. You don’t have to do that, but you can act to help people around you. You can opt to not ignore what is going on in the world around you, and you can choose to shape the world rather than be shaped by it. You will note that I have not mentioned the power of all this being embodied in a female character, but you can be sure that this movie will make girls and young women believe in themselves more than any other superhero movie in quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it is a smidge too long and the final fight between Diana and the big baddie is as unsatisfying as special effects laden battles often are. Nevertheless, I’m glad I managed to catch Wonder Woman while it was still on and I really recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It can be a struggle to keep writing. I’ve found this happened a lot since I moved the blog. First, there was  the business of moving things over. That meant a lot of thought about old posts and which ones I should keep. A lot of the time I thought “how on earth did I have time to write this?!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there seemed to be a lot more barriers to writing than previously. We can say what we like about the machinery that WordPress runs on, it does make it easy to write regularly. It also provides a lot of tools for making writing fun and for learning things as you go. I still have access to those things but it’s a little different now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, with it coming up for a year of living with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sustainabilityingrid.com/ingystravelog/&quot;&gt;Ingrid&lt;/a&gt; it just so happens that my creative outlets are a little different now. &lt;em&gt;Our&lt;/em&gt; creative outlets. And  they haven’t changed that much anyway. We cook. We visit places. We talk about culture and politics. It just seems more fun to do than to reflect. As I said, a different form of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it also goes without saying that the world continues apace, producing all sorts of interesting, strange, and terrible happenings. Things that I don’t feel that confident writing about. It can be quite hard to put a pin in it and not write about certain events. I know I’m not qualified to offer opinions on most things, but one of the reasons that I write is to understand what’s going on in and around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I managed to write about the election. I guess that story came to me and it felt right to tell it. But there’s lots of other stuff that I need to get around to. About work. About life. About music. About computers. All kinds of stuff. I feel like it will all tumble out eventually: this is just the start. It’s very exciting, even if a little daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, creativity manifests itself in many ways. Even if you do something like the dishes in new way that can be fun can’t it? And as for all the rest, I will try to write more and I will try to do more that is worthy of  report. Work and my MSc have felt like a bit of a grind at times but I’m now resolved to trying to inject a bit of fun and creativity in there too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tomorrow</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/tomorrow"/>
   <updated>2017-06-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/tomorrow</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you about something that I saw while doing my paper round on election day in 1997. Even though I was at college by then, I helped my sister out when she couldn’t do it. Something like that. I was 17 and just off voting age. I had no real interest in politics at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I’d known that people had been happy when Thatcher resigned a few years earlier. The morning she went the vicar from our village was speaking in our school assembly and the headmaster rushed in to share the news. All the teachers started cheering and clapping, and we, as exuberant schoolchildren, all joined in too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Emsworth. It’s a lovely place and really conservative. But something was clearly wrong with the country if vicars and teachers in dyed-in-the-wool conservative shires were cheering the resignation the prime minister. Thatcher’s government had become nasty and vindictive. It did not stand for Britishness or the British values. It stood for naked greed and everyone was sick of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like that now with the present government. I know that there are potential Conservative-type governments that I could vote for. But not this one. Again it sits in the corridors of power, concerned only with materialistic greed - using the fear of the unknown to set neighbours and families against one another. It has a famine mentality that sucks away the hope from this potentially great country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to 1997. On that election day an old man in Victoria road in Emsworth stood at his garden gate handing cups of tea to strangers. He had a big “Vote Labour” sign strapped to his fence and he beamed big smiles at every passer-by. As I nursed my tea, he asked if I was voting. I said that I couldn’t. I said that my mum was worried about a Labour government and that I didn’t think it mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you rich then? Is your mum rich? He said and he looked down at my bike, my shoes, and he knew that we weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blushed and said no. I grew up as almost the poorest kid in my peer group. Happy. Clever. But pretty poor. And he said, well she doesn’t have anything to worry about then. I said that I hoped so, handed back the mug and got on with my round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me that day was the excitement of that man, how politics actually meant something to him. Even today, I marvel at the optimism of someone who was voting in a totally safe tory seat and yet still campaigning. I realised that I would soon be old enough to vote and that I would also have to think about what mattered. I decided I would follow things with interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would learn later that this was not the first act of genorosity toward my family by a member of the Labour movement. The house I grew up in came to us via a Labour councillor, who swapped her two bedroom house for my parents’ tiny flat in … you guessed it … Victoria road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, on the eve of another election, I think of those people who changed and shaped my life - my family, my teachers, the crazy vicar who got arrested protesting the poll tax, that old man with his cups of tea, the councillor who helped my parents find their house, my house. I am as excited by tomorrow as that man was back in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, Jeremy Corbyn speaks to those values of generosity and solidarity in the same way. I’m pretty certain that he won’t be our next prime minister - but by God I’d be so proud to be British if he were. And I’ll be handing out cups of tea to passers-by for a MONTH.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Changes</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/changes"/>
   <updated>2017-04-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-the-blog-to-jekyll-again-sort-of&quot;&gt;Moving the blog to Jekyll (again, sort of)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et voila, my blog lives! In a new body (&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;) and at &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;a new location&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up Jekyll on my MacBook Air after loads of initial problems with installing the theme and getting assorted Ruby gems installed and working. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; is a friend for life now. By way of comparison, getting things up and running on my new Mac was simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I converted “all” my posts to markdown &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter/&quot;&gt;using a PHP script&lt;/a&gt; and my WordPress export file. Except for 90 or so posts that don’t get converted for some reason. I had to create posts for those by hand and paste the content in from Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this process I set up the sublimejekyll plugin on Sublime Text and that also took ages because… well I still don’t know why. I did uncover the following pro tip though: if a program says it can’t find a directory, it probably means that said directory really isn’t there. Make the damn directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I made the posts compatible for Jekyll I decided to delete a few older posts. Most were short and don’t add much to the overall flow of the blog. Image only posts never really added much. Besides I have Instagram for that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded all the images from the old version of the site: all 36,000 and 2.7Gb of them. Wordpress had created at least 18 copies of each image at different sizes. Oh dear. That resize image thumbnails plugin seemed like such a good idea at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deleted all the unnecessary images. I wish I could say I used some clever command line fu to get this done. I didn’t. I just used the innately useful keyboard shortcuts in MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realised that some posts before 2013 had images from a single folder elsewhere within my Wordpress install. This meant I had another 200 images to track down. In the end I used very few of these images but I’m glad I didn’t overlook them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I went through the posts every image asset got classified into hero / gallery / other. I used Automator to create small teaser versions of the hero images. In some places I’ve just used the larger hero images. This is not very efficient but was necessary for getting the site up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I have to go through each of the posts that I want to keep, changing the image references and setting the header and teaser images. The internal links all had to change too - and be warned that some of them may not have changed yet. (At heart I am very lazy.) I’ve learned a lot more about Sublime Text as part of this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not yet managed to sort out related posts for each post. The default Jekyll method is to use latent semantic indexing or lsi but for all my posts this takes an incredibly long time: about until the heat death of the known universe. It’s not that practical. Apparently there is a related posts plug-in that only uses tags (but I deleted all my tags because I thought they were what was slowing down lsi). Fixing this is very much on the to do list.
Of course at this point I don’t have much idea of how to track down internal links that may have died in the transition: always listen to your regex teachers when you are in school kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 New Year’s Resolution: learn to &lt;a href=&quot;http://regexr.com&quot;&gt;regex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it really is that that important!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-really-geeky-stuff&quot;&gt;The really geeky stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I should confess that I’ve used Jekyll before but because I was on shared hosting I had no ssh access to the server. This meant that I had to FTP over the whole caboodle every time that I ran Jekyll.  However I’ve fixed that side of things this time around. With the help of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nathangrigg.net/2012/04/rsyncing-jekyll/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/a&gt; I can deploy the site very quickly, only uploading the changes since last time. Compared to FTP it feels like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is now hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet and has a new domain name. There’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=mattischrome.com&quot;&gt;A+ rated&lt;/a&gt; security certificate and everything. My blog got hacked on shared hosting, though it may have been the fault of WordPress rather than most. Even so, with Jekyll there’s no database to infest with gribblies. My hope that this means I will avoid emailing myself a post shilling Christian Laboutin shoes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the performance of the new site using tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.pingdom.com&quot;&gt;Pingdom&lt;/a&gt; shows that there are still some optimisations to be made. However there are already a few little bells and whistles trilling away. If you add the site to the home screen of your phone or tablet, you should see my little logo. I can’t test it but it should also work with Windows 10 devices too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a little Google analytics tracker. This is not a permanent feature. I don’t intend to spy on my readers. It is there for the first few months to check the level of traffic to the site. I’ve not got wild expectations. I doubt I will even get the same numbers as I had for the WordPress version of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-changed&quot;&gt;What’s changed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my hosting solution change in mind, I decided that it would be better for there to be fewer images on the site. I still have backups of old posts so I can add some back at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve cut the number of posts from just over 600 down to just under 240. I kept all the series like the &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; and my posts about &lt;a href=&quot;south-america&quot;&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the book reviews remain. I jettisoned most of the pouting about my job and my life prior to going to South America, but some of it remains. Generally if a post changed my way of writing, I’ve kept it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our memories of the past aren’t set in stone. The internet has an awkward way of setting things in amber. Forgive me for favouring the plasticity of thought over the precision of tapes and drives. If you want to hold me to account for my terrible writing, that’s what the wayback machine is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing motivates the choice of posts retained from the old version of the blog. I want to get back to writing longer posts. Sometimes I used posts comprising mostly pictures as a way of churning out lots of posts, without really thinking about why I was writing them. I want to put a bit more thought in to writing. It would be nice if my posts were a reflection on my skills and passions, rather than mindless vanities or quick emotive responses to flash in the pan events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I must thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilityandtruth.com/about/&quot;&gt;Frank Hecker&lt;/a&gt;. His blog also uses Jekyll and the minimal mistakes theme. When I emailed him about how he set up his blog, he replied at length with many suggestions that were invaluable in getting things up and running. Also the documentation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/&quot;&gt;minimal mistakes&lt;/a&gt; was incredibly good, to the extent that it’s given me lots of ideas about what to put into posts. Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/&quot;&gt;table of contents&lt;/a&gt;. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say that I’ve written lots of posts in the past six months and that they are all ready to go. Unfortunately the niggling details of the relocation process absorbed more of my time. Well, that and the release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://civilization.com&quot;&gt;Civilization VI&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately the act of looking over my previous efforts gives me a few clues as to where I want to go. I hope you will join me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, March 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-march-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-03-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-march-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;blanck-mass-world-eater&quot;&gt;Blanck Mass &lt;em&gt;World Eater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album is pretty extreme. It’s not for everyone and even for the people who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; handle it, it’s not for all the time. This album is a soul crushing experience at points but there are also points of light. Perhaps this makes “World Eater” more reflective of life as a whole than any other of this month’s albums. On balance it’s probably less crushing than the last Blanck Mass album “Dumb Flesh”, which I reviewed back in June 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World Eater begins with “Jon Doe’s Carnival of Error”, a woozy fairground instrumental reminiscent of Orbital’s “I Wish I Had Duck Feet” from “Snivilization” (an upcoming understated classic). Just as that weird buttery instrumental gets going we lurch into “Rhesus Negative”, which for me is probably the most extreme track I will hear all year. I certainly don’t want to hear anything more extreme! It’s just at the edge of what I can tolerate: about five different tracks all bundled into one and crash impacted against the nearest hard surface for nine minutes. It is not a track that will calm your anxiety. However, if you’re in the mood for it it’s a powerful track: one for your weekly primal scream therapy session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “Rhesus Negative” is primal scream therapy, then the tracks that follow after are probably some sort of evil yoga. It’s pretty much the devil’s own mixtape and, as we know, the devil has all the best tunes. “Please” hangs on a vocal sample that sounds ripped from some classic summery house record from the early nineties, but it’s repeated over and over so much that it becomes a plea. All the while beats are smeared all over the please. It’s not as tough as the previous track but it’s still deeply unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Rat” is the most upbeat track - a stellar synth propelled by a demented bass line that sounds like a demonic remix of the Doctor Who theme. Like the other tracks, it’s weird and disturbing, particularly as elements of the mix are thrown around the stereo image towards the end. “Silent Treatment” is built around what sound like choral samples and the whole track sounds like a hyper-accelerated rush of adrenaline, pretty much what I imagine falling into a black hole might sound like. A rush of beats pushes down and compacts you, though when the vocal kicks in at about two minutes it briefly calms down. It’s mellow but only by the standards of this album: I don’t think it will be on your gym playlist any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intriguingly-titled “Minnesota / Eas Fors / Naked” begins with some unsettling and bewitching noises that might be running water, radio static or something else entirely. Probably all three. There’s something deeply compelling about the twitchiness of it. At four minutes it almost settles into a melody but strange spoken word overlays also appear just at the edge of your hearing. It’s almost like the point where you go under before an operation. By about six minutes I’m convinced I’m listening to a drawn out transformation of the opening minutes. At this point there is a melody and it feels like the whole track is pulled out and stretched over itself but backwards in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The niftiest trick of all is when the end (beginning?) of “Minnesota / Eas Fors / Naked” lurches into the staticky beats of “Hive Mind”. This is the most accessible track on the album and it even has discernible lyrics. If I were you, I wouldn’t listen to those lyrics to closely… especially if they’re saying what I think they’re saying. Maybe the whole album is a kind of musical Rorschach Test designed to make you see rats, bats and other assorted monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“World Eater” is not for everyone. When I listen to it I think it’s not really for me most of the time either. However, when you’re in the mood for it this album is utterly compelling - just as “Dumb Flesh” was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shins-heartworms&quot;&gt;The Shins &lt;em&gt;Heartworms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonable collection of new songs from The Shins. It’s been awhile but “they” are back - but really it’s just James Mercer now. This makes it rather tempting to read all the songs as autobiographical. I imagine songs like “Mildenhall” actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, which adds an extra layer of earnestness to them. The Shins’ best songs though have always retained a bit of mystery, which is why the fun of “Half a Million” and the layered vocals of the title track are more welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are some wiggly bits borrowed from his work with Danger Mouse on the Broken Bells albums. Those sounds - like the filtered vocals of “Painting a Hole” and the squelches on “Cherry Hearts” and the aforementioned “Half a million” - were also present on “Wincing the Night Away” and “Port of Morrow”. To summarise, there’s plenty to enjoy if you like those other Shins albums but maybe there’s not the same magic as way back on “Chutes Too Narrow”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rolling-blackouts-cf-the-french-press&quot;&gt;Rolling Blackouts CF &lt;em&gt;The French Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full name of this band is Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever. I like to think that their name, like a Mexican surname or an Edwardian football club, is simply that of some previous band names strung together. I heard them on the radio on our drive down to Cornwall and so I paid more attention when they popped up on my Discover Weekly as well. They’re from Melbourne, Australia (like many great people 😉) and are similar to The Strokes in their pomp, at least to my naive ears on a first listen. “The French Press” is an EP but as it’s almost as long as another of this month’s albums, I thought I’d give it a little review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact this EP mixes and matches a lot of other bands that I like. The title track blends The Strokes with the artier janglings of their successors like Parquet Courts. “Julie’s Place” sounds like a mellower Oasis (but not shitty mellow like “Gas Panic”) and “Sick Bug” emulates the Pixies convincingly. To my surprise things even take an antipodean turn on “Dig Up” where they manage to sound a bit like Crowded House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs as a whole are pleasant and jangly. Playing spot the reference is quite fun. The lyrics don’t really go anywhere too deep, though I do like the title track’s pleas for clear communication under surveillance. It could be a relationship metaphor but I wasn’t sure if any deeper meaning was intended. The lyrics to “Sick Bug” are probably the closest to making sense: that age old subject matter of wanting to get horizontal with someone in their bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give this a spin if you like jangly guitar pop playing in the background while you work. It’s not going to start a revolution but it’ll help you feel cool. It’ll sound great at that artisan coffee shop you hang out at. Vive le French Press!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jfdr-brazil&quot;&gt;JFDR &lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many albums in the digest these days, “Brazil” came to my attention via a song in my Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify. In this case it was the arresting song “Instant Patience”. Clocking in at just under five minutes, breathy Bjork-like vocals are arranged over a delicate synth line. The first time I heard it I was listening to Discover Weekly in bed and almost asleep - this song almost made sit bolt upright. In the dark it sounded like a spooky moment of instant clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JFDR is the professional name of Jófríður Ákadóttir, an Icelandic singer who records most of her music with her twin sister in a band called Pasqual Pinon. “Brazil” is her first solo album. It’s so good that I’m confident that it won’t be her last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I so much about the album is the way that it slowly builds up over 9 songs and 35 minutes. (Regular readers will also know how much I love short albums.) “White Sun” is a beautiful simple folk song borne on a plaintive vocal. The melody slaloms around for a few minutes gradually accreting synth noises. Each track repeats this process to some degree, with each song becoming more complicated as the album progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second song “Anew” piles on overdubbed vocal harmonies to a simple guitar line. Imagine Elliott Smith crossed with Bjork! I did, and I was hooked. “Instant Patience” iterates the formula but often cuts away those same vocal harmonies, creating the sense of space that makes the song so spooky and appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wires”, and “Airborne” later on, play with drum arrangements. Until “Wires” there’s barely any percussion at all, save for some cymbals that rush up into the mix at the end of “Anew”. “Wires” throbs with intent under that same detached cool voice but completely cuts away halfway through, almost like discovering a sunny clearing in a dark forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Higher State” is a piano ballad punctuated by strange rushes of noise. “Anything Goes” is similarly delicate. Things pick up again with “Airborne” which introduces skittering drums with a vague drum’n’bass feel. Yet even with the pace of the drums, the song still has a languid air in keeping with the rest of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two songs keep up the sonic experiments with ever busier arrangements. “Destiny’s Upon Us” even has an electric guitar sulking in the background and there’s a weird 8 bit synth noise that’s most likely off that 1980’s Casio keyboard your mate owned. And yet JFDR’s voice is never overwhelmed by these arrangements, always striking out clear over them. Part of that might be the preparation from earlier tracks, and part of it an otherworldly voice as able to command a noisy backdrop as an entirely silent one. The final song “Journey” is so much a complete song that it feels the whole album has built up to it. A folky ballad with lilting guitar and sparky synths behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this album. It’s short and coherent. It builds to its ending but each individual song stands alone despite being a component of a larger whole. I’d love to hear remixers get to grips with some of them. It also goes without saying that I’ll be researching the Pasqual Pinon albums. I’ll also be looking forward keenly to new songs from JFDR.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, February 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;grails-chalice-hymnal&quot;&gt;Grails &lt;em&gt;Chalice Hymnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some albums are good because a band continues making the music that you love. Some albums are good because a band takes their ideas a step or two further than before. &lt;em&gt;Chalice Hymnal&lt;/em&gt;is that rare album that does both of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The references to past albums include the track &lt;em&gt;Deeper Politics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deep Snow II&lt;/em&gt;, and, as per albums past, these tracks evolve slowly out of languid guitar hooks and smoky atmospherics. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However Grails are also a restless band as well as a restful one. The sheer number of side acts that members of the band are involved with, including Watter and Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne, are testimony to that. As a result there’s also some revolution mixed in with the revolution here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;em&gt;Tough Guy&lt;/em&gt; for instance. The Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne project grew out of repurposing Grails tracks as instrumental hip hop. This track feeds that process back in the other direction with a swinging swagger that keeps the track in motion. As the title suggests it’s more robust than your average Grails tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pelham&lt;/em&gt; is a noise-fest reminiscent of bands like Russian Circles. The slightly-too-long closing track &lt;em&gt;After the Funeral&lt;/em&gt; is a reminder that while this band once named one of their albums &lt;em&gt;Doommonger’s Holiday&lt;/em&gt;, their tongues may not have been firmly in their cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite track is called &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a beautiful and folky tune, the sort of thing that Grails seem able to dash off without even thinking about it. Its seemingly improvised nature gives it an emotional heft, after all it’s often more meaningful when we express emotion without intention, when we don’t even have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude this is another interesting and compelling album from Grails. It would serve as a good introduction if you’ve never heard their music before. If you have heard them before then you’ll know what to expect and I think you will like what you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elbow-little-fictions&quot;&gt;Elbow &lt;em&gt;Little Fictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy Garvey could sing the ingredients of a can of tomato soup and make you cry. That said, it’s felt like more recent Elbow albums lost their way. They became a bit too narrative: it became possible to map stories about his personal life on to the songs. “Build a rocket boys!” seemed preoccupied with serious subject matter. Perhaps they felt that serious statement songs were needed once everyone started playing “One Day Like This” at their weddings. Meanwhile, “The Takeoff And Landing of Everything” made the mistake of thinking that tales of transatlantic living were somehow interesting to those of us who got caught up in the original camp fire glow of songs like “Red” and “Any Day Now”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt in my mind that both albums have redeeming songs. But the thing that made both “The Seldom Seen Kid” and “Asleep in the Back” so darn irresistible is that they were each a knockout run of eleven great songs from start to finish. For elbow there’s very little elbow room these days: the bar is set high, beyond the reach of many other bands. I’d started to wonder if they were out of reach of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great news is that “Little Fictions” is another fantastic album. It’s knotty and tricksy, perhaps more in keeping with “Cast of Thousands” or “Leaders of the Free World”. The title refers to how they have returned to writing about characters and the details of their invented lives. Some bands need to tell you how it is, Elbow will more often break your heart with modern fairy tales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dreadzone-dread-times&quot;&gt;Dreadzone &lt;em&gt;Dread Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regular readers will know, I’m a big fan of Dreadzone’s Second Light. As I discussed in my review of Grails’ new album above, sometimes the hardest thing is for a beloved band to give you new material that doesn’t slavishly depend on the past. Dread Times might be thought of as a jukebox album, taking elements of past Dreadzone albums to produce new tracks that recombine and remix those elements. As with the Grails album, it’s an evolution rather than a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much to like on Dread Times, which inverts a the band’s usual trick of peppering techno tracks with trad reggae. This time the approach is more song-based. While this means that the samples are not quite as extensive or clever (there’s little of the mood building of Second Light or Earth Radio here), but it does mean that there’s a bit more to hang onto. Other Dreadzone albums have been song-based but Dread Times is one of their more successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;em&gt;Rootsman&lt;/em&gt;, which gets things off to a garrulling start - especially with its “all of the youth“ chorus. &lt;em&gt;Mountain&lt;/em&gt; mixes Tricky-like rapping with can-do positive messages, a combination that sounds better through speakers than it does as typed out text. &lt;em&gt;16 Hole&lt;/em&gt; makes a plea for an end to gun violence and does so with an ear worm for a chorus: the best advice is catchy advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Area Code&lt;/em&gt; is a hyper-kinetic party song that is all over my playlists. It has the best reference to the rings of Saturn in any album this month, or most months come to think of it. It’s a belter of a song that really gets you up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album tails off with &lt;em&gt;Where is my Friend?&lt;/em&gt;, a near-acoustic song about a missing DJ. It’s touching and demonstrates that for all Dreadzone’s occasional  over-production they do know their way with a good tune and how to leave it alone. The last track &lt;em&gt;After the Storm&lt;/em&gt; echoes &lt;em&gt;Out of Heaven&lt;/em&gt; off Second Light, perhaps even making a cheeky nod to the YouTube video that set &lt;em&gt;Out of Heaven&lt;/em&gt; to the tornado scene from Wizard of Oz (Needless to say, that video is not up on YouTube anymore.). After the Storm is slightly more upbeat and is a nice salve for those hankering for the other side of Dreadzone throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good that Dreadzone have kept going and also nice that they’ve been rewarded with their highest chart placing for many a year. Long may it continue!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, January 2017</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2017"/>
   <updated>2017-01-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;mike-oldfield-return-to-ommadawn&quot;&gt;Mike Oldfield &lt;em&gt;Return to Ommadawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Return to Ommadawn&lt;/em&gt;, Mike Oldfield revisits his third album Ommadawn. He has past form for this, having revisited his masterwork Tubular Bells twice (the third revisit and fourth instalment Tubular Bells 4 is due next year). I wrote about Tubular Bells II for my understated classics series. Of course Mike has in fact made many more than three Tubular Bells albums&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and this is not a first “return” to Ommadawn. His 1990 album Amorok was a similar affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to mention Amorok as it makes for an interesting comparison to this new album. While recording Amorok Mike was disenchanted with making music or at least the political side of it. At that time, Virgin Records didn’t even bother to promote his records. It’s telling that one of the bigger rarities of the Oldfield canon is a promo cassette containing three extracts from Amorok that was sent to readers of the WHSmith magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble with Amorok is that it also distilled the worst of Mike Oldfield’s music at that time. It’s slipshod in places, relies on jokes that aren’t funny and continues with half baked ideas for longer than necessary. In places Amorok seems to say “will this do?” and “how about this?”  It’s an album that gurns more than it smiles, and is worse for it. It’s not helped by being a single hour-long track or that the cover art defensively excoriates “cloth eared nincompoops” before you even hear it. For all the prettiness and invention of long passages of Amorok, it did not do much to enhance the memory of the original Ommadawn. Hostility towards editing usually means that you need an editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is good that Amorok doesn’t get to settle the legacy of “Ommadawn”. The original album, released in 1975, is the one that settled whether Mike was a one hit wonder or not. Tubular Bells sold by the bucket load and so Hergest Ridge, a quickly-composed follow-up that replaced catchy themes with anger and bluster. Ommadawn was intended as a counter to this. Mike took his time to compose it and made sure to incorporate themes that were important to him. Chief among them are the Celtic instruments that appear throughout the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until composing Ommadawn, Oldfield had been writing under pressure since demoing the first half of part one of Tubular Bells to Richard Brandon. Writing the remainder of Tubular Bells and the entirety of Hergest Ridge at pace did yield some successful moments: the instrument roll call at the end of Part one of Tubular Bells, the sleepy sunny intros to part two of Tubular Bells and part one of Hergest Ridge. However, the miraculous sunrise intro to Ommadawn is something else entirely. I think it should be regarded as highly as those opening lines of Tubular Bells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of Ommadawn works when it doesn’t try too hard. It revels in its oddness, something that Oldfield learned to do as the monster success of his debut began to grate with previously supportive critics. Oldfield’s contributions are virtuoso throughout, though long passages find him hiding behind his collaborators. These sections are uneven and the whole piece ends up tripped over into silliness by the last four minutes of Part Two. Some track listings represent this section as a single track called “On Horseback”. It’s a song about a man who’d rather be on horseback. Unfortunately it also features a children’s choir and makes Clive Dunn’s much-maligned Grandad sound like black metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return to Ommadawn differs from Tubular Bells II. It’s not a “shot for shot remake” and the technology is placed firmly behind the speakers rather than through them. The liner notes say little, save to point out that no synthesisers appear on the record&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. What we get as listeners is a thorough exploration of all Ommadawn’s themes filtered through a lifetime of experience. It took a while to convince me but after a few listens it is in fact rather marvellous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important feature is just how sensitive it is. There are phrases and sections that make me shiver. Other parts will make you think of rain drops tracking their way down window panes. Others are strong and bold and confident, all shiny with winter sunshine. It’s a beautiful melancholic experience with a radiant happy ending. “On Horseback” gets transformed into sampled pulp (see earlier footnote) and apparently the only original vocal contribution to the album is for Mike to say “On Horseback? I’d rather be here!”. Of course mate, you live in the Bahamas now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably Mike’s best album since Tubular Bells III. It has that album’s sense of exploration, the sensitivity of “The Songs of Distant Earth”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a self-restraint lacking from the likes of “Voyager” and “Amorok”. It bodes well for Tubular Bells 4, but those reissues of “Islands” and “Earth Moving” (also coming this year?) will look a little jaded by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonobo-migration&quot;&gt;Bonobo &lt;em&gt;Migration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I decided to review Migration I worried that I might repeat &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-august-2013/&quot;&gt;my review of The North Borders&lt;/a&gt; from a few years back. On a first, loose, listen it doesn’t sound like a lot has changed. In fact the opening bars of “Migration” sound a bit like the music Apple uses to soundtrack your Photos memories. It’s still soulful tasteful dance music that you tend to nod to rather than dance to. Because I listen to a lot of music and to my ears Migration sounds like other Bonobo records more than anything else, it’s hard to hear (at first) whether it’s any sort of step forward from The North Borders. That is to say, why should you pick this record over any of his other records?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I found that when I listened repeatedly and deliberately to Migration I found a lot to like within its layers and beats. Every track is beautifully produced, many elements are sounds that only exist within software. This mannered approach is not new, it’s a case of evolution rather than revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the title track might form a sonic comfort blanket and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhyemusic.com&quot;&gt;Rhye’s&lt;/a&gt; contributions to “Break Apart” aren’t much to get excited about, the album does pick up with “Outlier”. Lasting eight minutes, it does something pretty cool at about 4:30: a synth line that’s repeated throughout takes over the whole track and becomes meatier than anything on “The North Borders”. As an assertive action reaching out to the listener, it’s the most arresting moment on the entire album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Grains” features some interesting voice manipulations but Holly Herndon and Kaitlynn Aurelia Smith cover this ground more convincingly for me. “Second Sun” is a gorgeous chill out track, the strings in particular are very enjoyable as they cut in over the synths. Nicole Miglis of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hundred-waters.com&quot;&gt;Hundred Waters&lt;/a&gt; appears on “Surface”, a track that is more polished than the work of her band but one that lacks their appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bambro Koyo Ganda” seems more in keeping with the album’s title and premise, a collaboration with Moroccan band &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clevelandart.org/events/music-and-performances/innov-gnawa&quot;&gt;Innov Gnawa&lt;/a&gt;. It’s loose and funky and best of all it isn’t lulling you to sleep. There should have been about five tracks featuring these guys, I will have to check out more of their stuff&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “Kerala” is also upbeat, though also not a million miles from “Jets” on “The North Borders”. “Ontario” is great though, mixing up lots of live instrumentation samples into a compelling whole like a less woozy Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like the vocal on “No Reason”, it sounds too much like the anonymous stadium dance of Avicii and his ilk. That said, there are some nice moody moments in the mix: I think I’d like to hear an instrumental version. “7th Sevens” slowly retreads through “Outlier” but with less menace and more soundtrack samples. “Figures” closes out the album with slow strings and more “Grains”-style vocal manipulations, it’s pretty but it’s not going to save your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is a good hangover album. Enough to keep you awake, but not too much to tax you. There’s no real mission or direction, despite how pretty everything sounds. And of course, I don’t really get hangovers any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-xx-i-see-you&quot;&gt;The xx &lt;em&gt;I See You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The xx continue their progress into colour. Jamie’s solo album last year provides the template for much of “I See You”, in which the band take more steps toward revealing themselves and the characters that populate their songs. Remi in particular sounds like a revelation, lending songs like “Say Something Loving” and “Test Me” with real emotional weight rather than the icy detachment of songs from their first two albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about “I See You” is that it continues to play to the main strengths of The xx, that of producing music pared back to particular principles and ideas. While “I See You” may be less detached from the listener, it still maintains a wary distance. Not for the nothing are the songs about isolation or disquiet in relationships. It’s an album that needs subject matter that matches the tensions in the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some points, I thought that it might be too aching, too self-aware, too self-contained. There’s certainly a lot of repetition in the track list, even if the songs themselves manage to cast light on similar things from different angles. Essentially “Say Something Loving”, “Performance” and “Brave For You” are all about the same thing: taking the strain in a relationship that’s in difficulty. They deserve some slack because that’s  pretty universal subject matter for pop songs and it’s certainly interesting to listen to how the production tricks combine to create very different-sounding songs from essentially the same lyrical ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I enjoyed this album more than their other two but I still get the feeling while listening to it that it’s all too arch. I still can’t quite care about their songs enough to rave about them (except for “Say Something Loving”, which is great). However, I like the fact that the workings are shown and that, once again, The xx promise great things for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Personally, I like to forget that oddities like Orchestral Tubular Bells, The Millennium Bell, and Tubular Bells 2003 ever existed. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, “vocal samples” are used. If you listen carefully, this even includes the “Happy?!” sample from Amorok. There is no explanation of which gadgets or software helped make this possible. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The album that I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have written about for Understated Classics! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There’s an eponymous EP on Spotify from 2016 that I’ll try to cover in a future digest. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #34: Stray by Aztec Camera</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-34"/>
   <updated>2016-10-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-34</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The next instalment in my understated classics series is &quot;Stray&quot; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://killermontstreet.net&quot;&gt;Aztec Camera&lt;/a&gt;. Released in 1990, it features two hit singles and the cover is my favourite colour: green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My angle for writing about “Stray” was that it was an album that I &quot;caught&quot; from my parents. I soon realised that I wrote about some of those already, for example “The Circle and the Square&quot; by Red Box. Besides, I’m not sure that my parents liked this album that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember my dad having a C90 in the car with this album on one side and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billyjoel.com/news/revisiting-billy-joels-storm-front-album-25-years-later/&quot;&gt;Billy Joel's album &quot;Storm Front&quot;&lt;/a&gt; on the other. &quot;Storm Front&quot; is a good album but not a great one. It starts with &quot;We Didn't Start The Fire&quot; but goes downhill from there. But that cassette might as well have had only one side because we rarely heard any of &quot;Stray&quot;. My dad’s always been one for sticking to what he likes and he didn’t seem to have any time for “Stray”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And nor did I until about 1996. I remember a rainy day in June or July of that year, between the last of my GCSEs and the start of my summer job. I was bored. So, in an age with much less choice and at a time when I had fewer sources of new things to listen to, I settled down to listen to some albums belonging to my parents. I avoided the LPs because back then turntables weren't as glamorous as they are now and I didn't want to scratch the records either. To a novice that needle-dropping stuff looked &lt;em&gt;complicated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine my fingers tracing down the spines of the stack of twenty or so CDs wedged between the hifi and the acres of vinyl my parents owned. Billy Ocean? Nope. Billy Joel? Heard that. Bruce Springsteen? All the good ones are on vinyl. The Three Tenors at the Hollywood Bowl? No thanks. What's the Story Morning Glory? Again? Nah. And so I happened upon &quot;Stray&quot; by Aztec Camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you'll remember Aztec Camera as the 'band' that released “Somewhere In My Heart” in the 80s. Even if the band name means nothing to you, you'll know the song. It's irresistibly catchy: in another universe you're being &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling&quot;&gt;rick-rolled&lt;/a&gt; by it rather than &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;. But Aztec Camera aren't really a band. They started out as a collection of session musicians arranged around a talented songwriter Roddy Frame. As he gained confidence in his songwriting he embraced a solo approach and now he records under his own name, rather than Aztec Camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stray&quot; is an album at a transition point, showing off a songwriter halfway between torch singer and the leader of a fake band. Tellingly he’s alone on the cover. It's torn between two views of the world, uncertain of itself and quite unlike the records he'd released beforehand. The songs themselves are either slow and moody, or raucous and agitated. There's no middle ground on &quot;Stray&quot; and as such it barely holds together, stretched in two directions by opposing forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was that tension which drew me in. Faced with my own line between the past of school and the future of working to earn my keep, perhaps I embraced the dichotomy of sneering songs like “Good Morning Britain” rubbing up against ballads like “Over My Head”. And of course, it might just be that it was a fine album featuring songs of a kind that I hadn’t paid much heed to before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to it again as a “grown up”, I’m taken by how much of it I wouldn’t have understood. The title track seems to be a plea for a one night stand, but from a perspective I wouldn’t have appreciated until a few years ago. The sentiment of “Get Outta London” is something that I would have only got behind in the last few years (and listener, I did). At sixteen the line “don’t be too gay” in “Good Morning Britain” is something I might have glossed over or tried to ignore, these days it makes me angry just how much it enscapsulates the prevailing views of the establishment at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other interesting thing about “Stray” is that it’s an album that inverts song styles. The ‘sad’ slow songs are the happiest ones and most of the faster ‘brighter’ songs drip with cynicism. Even “The Crying Scene”, an upbeat song about making the most of your chances because “life’s a one-take movie”, manages to sound wary of believing its own advice. “How It Is” is darker still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slow songs are where you find shafts of light. The title track exudes languid contentment despite its sad sack sound, “Over My Head” affects a grimace, and “Notting Hill Blues” yucks up your first world problems way before you ever hashtagged them. Meanwhile the closing “Song For A Friend” plaintively calls out for a belief in true love, but in a way that suggests it will actually arrive: “Stand straight in what kills you and confounds you / And break its chains and still believe”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an album that’s shifted in my perceptions over the years I’ve known it and one that I continue to enjoy, I have no hesitation in recommending “Stray” to you as an understated classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Fun fact: “Good Morning Britain” features &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jones_(The_Clash_guitarist)&quot;&gt;Mick Jones formerly of The Clash&lt;/a&gt; and Billy Joel’s “Storm Front” album was produced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jones_(Foreigner_guitarist)&quot;&gt;Mick Jones formerly of Foreigner&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Heavyweight Podcast</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/heavyweight-podcast"/>
   <updated>2016-10-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/heavyweight-podcast</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/show/heavyweight/about/&quot;&gt;Heavyweight&lt;/a&gt; is a podcast about “heavyweight” issues, in the sense of burdens on the soul, rather than the burning issues of the day. It’s presented by Jonathan Goldstein, who was the host of the WireTap podcast. Each week he helps someone resolve an issue from their past. These include resolving family feuds and understanding mid-life depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a generalist who often takes a broader view of things. Heavyweight reminds me that the emotions of individuals are as important as the wider trends that affect groups. It’s helped reinforce my recent thinking that one leads to the other and that it’s more of a causal relationship than we might think. Despite my interest in the general, I’m a microeconomist at heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, three episodes of Heavyweight have aired. I know the series could yet go downhill but so far I’ve found each episode improves on the last. Three’s a manageable number to write about so here’s a mini-review of each episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first episode Jonathan persuades his elderly father Buzz to resolve a dispute with his brother Sheldon. The story’s carefully constructed so that the details unfold as you listen. The interviews and the narration give a real sense of how the brothers have grown apart. While Jonathan sometimes intervenes to help them sort out their issue, it does seem as though you listen to them resolving it for themselves. I wonder how much they had to discuss while not recording, and how much they cut from the recordings. They manage to toe the line between storytelling and voyeurism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second episode Jonathan helps his friend Gregor get some CDs back from a famous musician. This one must have written itself because Gregor’s such an interesting and funny person, and as the episode becomes more a meditation on how to interact with celebrities, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allmusic.com/album/sounds-of-the-south-4-cds-mw0000619631&quot;&gt;the CDs&lt;/a&gt; start to feel like a macguffin. How would it make you feel if one of your friends suddenly became successful? And how do you measure your life against that success? Can you? Should you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two episodes cover interesting ground. Both concern how we move on from the past. Both consider how it feels to compare yourself to others and fall short. And in both episodes Jonathan worries about his efficacy as interlocutor, while each time delivering a compelling story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan’s self-deprecation comes to a head in the third episode with his description about how he wanted to be an artist. It allows him to describe a piece of video art where a woman rages and sobs, all while a girl sits impassively beside her. He says he has always wondered about that girl and sets out to find her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting this episode’s named for the girl in the video though it actually resolves Jonathan’s issue. I’d like to explain more about the story but it’s better not to give away spoilers. Suffice to say that a) it’s an interesting story and b) it’s already resolved by the time Jonathan “intervenes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third episode made me a believer but it also intrigued me as to what the podcast’s really about. Whose experiences do we listen to? Perhaps the experience is our experience of listening to it? Sometimes it feels clunky: the third episode has obvious “thinking music” that plays as Jonathan interjects. The conversation that you’re more interested in feels paused underneath these intrusions. I don’t listen to a lot of podcasts but perhaps these represent experiments in the form? Or maybe he’s cribbing from other podcasts? I mainly listen to discussion-type podcasts so it’s good to hear something new. I’ve never listened to WireTap but it ran for eleven years, so they must know what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where I’ve got to. When this post goes up, episode four goes out the next day. I look forward to it. I recommend the Heavyweight podcast, it’s available through &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1150800298&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/heavyweightpodcast&quot;&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mira Schendel at Tate Modern</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/mira-schendel-tate-modern"/>
   <updated>2016-10-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/mira-schendel-tate-modern</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/29/mira-schendel-tate-modern-review&quot;&gt;Mira Schendel&lt;/a&gt; was a Brazilian artist who was active throughout the middle to late twentieth century. She is considered to be one of South America’s best artists. Known mostly for her abstract paintings, she also experimented with sculptures and installations. Many of her works use text and semiotics to explore and define possible meanings for more abstract works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this exhibition during its run in the Tate Modern in the Autumn of 2013. I didn’t feel like writing about it at the time. In fact I may not have had any time because it was quite close to my departure for South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may not have written about them but I remember the pieces vividly. I also remember that the exhibition was rather heavily policed with helpers that intervened often to prevent people from taking pictures. Some helpers are less proactive, so photos always get through eventually! With this in mind I set up an IFTTT recipe that collected pictures tagged #miraschendel on Instagram and put them in my Dropbox. The intention was to use them when I eventually wrote about the exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward three years and I found 250 odd pictures in my Dropbox. The time has come! I can’t really say much more about the exhibition now but it’s good to share the photos. They’re a sort of time capsule with a Mira Schendel theme. I whittled them down to thirty-four pictures that don’t include any portraits or reflected portraits. I tried to avoid the weirder frames and filters where possible. The artwork “Still Waves of Probability” - consisting of a roomful of translucent fibres hanging from the ceiling - proved very popular for selfies and portraits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the gallery. If I can find a copy of the exhibition catalogue I will add captions with titles later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone on Instagram who took these pictures. I have no idea who you are. Remember when you post things on apps with hashtags, someone might come along and scrape them up! Soon Ingrid and I are off to visit some more Exhibitions at the Tate Modern so expect more posts about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, September 2016</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2016"/>
   <updated>2016-09-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2016</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month’s album digest features albums by Wilco, M.I.A., Local Natives, and a collaboration between Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith and Suzanne Ciani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wilco-schmilco&quot;&gt;Wilco &lt;em&gt;Schmilco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schmilco&lt;/em&gt; is the tenth studio album by Wilco, which regular readers will know are one of my favourite bands. &lt;a href=&quot;/whatever-happened-to-that-hat/&quot;&gt;There’s no need to repeat that anecdote about why this blog has the name that it does.&lt;/a&gt; Meanwhile, this album follows on from last year’s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and is probably the third Wilco album to have a jokey meta- kind of title. (The other one is the rather splendid &lt;em&gt;Wilco (The Album)&lt;/em&gt; from 2009.) I didn’t write a review of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;; it  was released for free and for some reason it passed me by. &lt;em&gt;Schmilco&lt;/em&gt; is a fairly similar album and that’s not a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a short album containing songs that are mostly acoustic, though there are some that stand out because they diverge from that formula. I’d say a fairly typical song would be &lt;em&gt;If I Ever Was A Child&lt;/em&gt;, which trills along nicely for three minutes. It revists the territory of &lt;em&gt;A Ghost Is Born&lt;/em&gt; with allusions to migraines, albeit it does so in a brief and throwaway lines. It’s a fairly mysterious song which makes the simple arrangement feel clever, as though there is some hidden depth. I need to listen to it some more to be sure whether or not there actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another standout track is &lt;em&gt;Common Sense&lt;/em&gt;, a song that has another crack at Krautrock. This time instead of focusing on Neu!-like motorik stylings as per &lt;em&gt;Spiders (Kidsmoke)&lt;/em&gt; they deliver a clattering clanging loose-limbed jam that I recognised  as being like CAN. It has a similar feel to many of the more song-like demos on &lt;a href=&quot;/can-the-lost-tapes/&quot;&gt;CAN’s (not-so) recent box set&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also quite like &lt;em&gt;Locator&lt;/em&gt;, a song that could be about drones and/or being tracked by Google. It’s effortless and wry. Even better, it doesn’t overstay its welcome. It begins to fade out almost as soon as it reveals what it’s all about. That’s also true of the whole album, which is a brief and jangly affair that doesn’t stick around too long. A bit like when a cool friend comes to visit. Hopefully they’ll be back again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mia-aim&quot;&gt;M.I.A. &lt;em&gt;AIM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive me if I write M.I.A. as MIA from now on. &lt;em&gt;AIM&lt;/em&gt; is her fifth album. I love her first two albums &lt;em&gt;Arular&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kala&lt;/em&gt; deeply, but found her third to be pretentious and annoying. I managed to miss out on her fourth album &lt;em&gt;Matangi&lt;/em&gt;, I think because it was released while I was in South America. (Even if I ended up with more data access over there than I thought, I didn’t really think that maintaining Spotify access would be possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I don’t know what &lt;em&gt;Matangi&lt;/em&gt; is like but I do know that &lt;em&gt;AIM&lt;/em&gt; is frustrating. It’s not bad in the way that the third album was bad (I’m avoiding the awkward typography of its title), it’s just frustrating. I think there are songs that MIA wasn’t confident in that would have been better given more care and attention. I think there are others that aren’t that good but that maybe she thinks are pretty good. There are also some decent songs and  good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the good stuff. The opening track &lt;em&gt;Borders&lt;/em&gt; is great and probably just how you’d expect MIA to sound in 2016. There’s a song called &lt;em&gt;Ali R U OK?&lt;/em&gt; that’s funny and witty, but which also has a darker point to discuss. &lt;em&gt;AMP&lt;/em&gt; delivers a positive feminist message with both strength and humour. I think she’s as relevant as she ever was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s still clever and innovative too. &lt;em&gt;Jump In&lt;/em&gt; shows her inventiveness hasn’t dimmed. On &lt;em&gt;Kala&lt;/em&gt; she used technology to emphasise and accentuate her samples and ideas, hooking it up to great tunes. Here the songwriting has abandoned her a bit but the self-sampling and looping provide a weird and weary air to the tune. This is why I wonder if the malaise of &lt;em&gt;AIM&lt;/em&gt; is grounded in a lack of confidence: I think that ten years ago she would have saved the idea for a better song. I know that this is conjecture and nitpicking on my part but that’s why we have to discuss the poorer songs too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bird Song&lt;/em&gt; straddles the good and the bad aspects of the album. There’s a great sample but the underlying idea is underdeveloped. There’s potential, but it just descends into a bad joke rather than make a valid point. Two mixes of it don’t help to shake the half-assed feel of it either. If that won’t do, will this? I like it enough for it to make my playlists but it feels as though it could and should have been so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album is mostly dull rather than awful. I’d never imagined a MIA record would ever be boring back when I was so enjoying &lt;em&gt;Arular&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kala&lt;/em&gt; so much. For example, &lt;em&gt;Freedun&lt;/em&gt; (featuring Zayn Malik formerly of One Direction) is a total snoozefest. Apparently it was written over Whatsapp and that doesn’t surprise me. &lt;em&gt;Foreign Friend&lt;/em&gt; is almost witty but it is dragged down by an awful vocal from Dexta Daps. &lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt; is so denched in autotune as to be pointless: the whole point of her previous records was not hiding behind studio tricks, she always articulated herself with her own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, in a pun that writes itself, &lt;em&gt;AIM&lt;/em&gt; as an album seems aimless. All is not entirely lost but perhaps like Tricky (another artist lost to wilfulness and misdirection) she’s now doomed to echoing past glories with diminishing returns. I hope that’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-natives-sunlit-youth&quot;&gt;Local Natives &lt;em&gt;Sunlit Youth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first few listens I was very excited by &lt;em&gt;Sunlit Youth&lt;/em&gt;. I was amazed that I’d never heard of them before. After a few more listens I feel more that this is a solid album with a couple of big-hitting singles. It gets major bonus points for featuring Nina Persson of the Cardigans (Second &lt;a href=&quot;/understated-classics-25-long-gone-before-daylight-cardigans/&quot;&gt;understated classics klaxon&lt;/a&gt; of the month) and for featuring lyrics about a chrome palace (especially given the first &lt;a href=&quot;/uc-27-a-ghost-is-born-wilco/&quot;&gt;Wilco-related understated classics klaxon&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song with the Chrome palace lyric is &lt;em&gt;Villainy&lt;/em&gt; and is probably the song that’s embedded itself most into my head this year. I fell in love with its video, which cleverly subverts the lyric video. They’re a band that’s clearly in love with their own lyrics but not without reason, I find them to be enjoyable to read. They also make good videos, or rather they know a good video treatment when they see one. The video for &lt;em&gt;Wide Eyes&lt;/em&gt; - a song from their first album &lt;em&gt;Gorilla Manor&lt;/em&gt; - is one of the best I’ve seen in years. I’ve embedded it below, because it’s excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NmefFcRJbXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be checking out all their previous albums. Because one of them was produced by a member of The National (another of my favourite bands), I was expecting Local Natives to have a certain depth. As it turns out - on &lt;em&gt;Sunlit Youth&lt;/em&gt; at least - they have more earnestness than depth. For example &lt;em&gt;Fountain of Youth&lt;/em&gt; could just be incredibly earnest (“We can do whatever we want / we can say whatever we mean”) or be satirising overearnestness - it’s hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere it doesn’t really matter what their intentions are. &lt;em&gt;Masters&lt;/em&gt; has an intensity that drives it along not to mention an interesting squiggly bass line. &lt;em&gt;Mother Emanuel&lt;/em&gt; has a killer chorus but gets right to the jugular from the first verse. It also has a bridge that sounds a bit like &lt;em&gt;Chopsticks&lt;/em&gt;, which shouldn’t work but does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are mis-steps too. I think that &lt;em&gt;Ellie Alice&lt;/em&gt; is a bit boring but I can relate to the story of travelling through the channel tunnel while wasted from lack of sleep. &lt;em&gt;Sea of Years&lt;/em&gt; tries to hard to close the album on something resembling a weepie, though I do like the drumming.
I will listen to Local Natives’ other albums and will keep an ear out for any new material. From the earlier videos (like &lt;em&gt;Wide Eyes&lt;/em&gt;) I wonder whether they peaked early. That’d be good for me as there’ll be even better albums than &lt;em&gt;Sunlit Youth&lt;/em&gt; for me to discover, but it also means that album number four could be even better too. Win win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kaitlyn-aurelia-smith-and-suzanne-ciani-sunergy&quot;&gt;Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith and Suzanne Ciani &lt;em&gt;Sunergy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album consists of two tracks and is thirty five minutes long, so it’s more like a single. The Spotify version also has a bonus track that extends the album by another 18 minutes. I’ll write mostly about the two main tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who are Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith and Suzanne Ciani?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kaitlynaureliasmith.com&quot;&gt;Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith&lt;/a&gt; is an American composer who has already released an album this year. As a result of enjoying &lt;em&gt;Sunergy&lt;/em&gt; so much, I will include her album &lt;em&gt;Ears&lt;/em&gt; in next month’s album digest. She has collaborated with Mark Pritchard (&lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-may-2016/&quot;&gt;review of &lt;em&gt;Under the Sun&lt;/em&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;) She’s also made a remix of a piece from Max Richter’s &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt; project, so I will track that down too. (This reminds me that I need to write about &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt; at some point too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sevwave.com&quot;&gt;Suzanne Ciani&lt;/a&gt; is an American composer with a long career as a pioneer of electronic music. She’s produced lots of commercial and soundtrack work, as well more established albums. Five of her albums have been nominated for Grammy awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two women were brought together by their love of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://buchla.com&quot;&gt;Buchla&lt;/a&gt; synthesizer, which is what I presume is what noodles over the two (or three) tracks on &lt;em&gt;Sunergy&lt;/em&gt;. It’s beautiful generative music that deserves to languidly spread over tens of minutes at a time in the way that it does. In many ways it reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-october-2012/&quot;&gt;Laurie Spiegel’s work&lt;/a&gt;, though I think that was made on custom-made synths and computers rather than on a particular synthesizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these two (three) tracks deserve your attention. The short track list makes for a quick review. &lt;em&gt;A New Day&lt;/em&gt; fizzes and meanders with all the promise of a dawning morning. &lt;em&gt;Closed Circuit&lt;/em&gt; is a little more lively, though it has a quiet intensity rather than an overt one. The electric riffs roil in tight curls before peeling off and over one another. It’s music with both motion and stillness. The “bonus” track &lt;em&gt;Retrograde&lt;/em&gt; is more animated. Though also constructed on the great whooshes of the Buchla synth, there are also moments where the intensity rises to almost noisy electronic roar, with cataracts of melodies crashing between the ears and notes that teeter on top of one another clamouring into the mix. It’s thrilling stuff, especially if you sometimes like to think of music as a place to be rather than a means of getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Threepenny Opera</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/threepenny-opera"/>
   <updated>2016-09-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/threepenny-opera</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Ingrid and I went to see The Threepenny Opera at the National Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Threepenny Opera was written by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, based on Elisabeth Hauptmann’s German translation of John Gay’s “A Beggar’s Opera”. It was first performed in Weimar Berlin in 1928 and has evolved over time through many adaptations, including several film and off-Broadway versions. It’s a work with very powerful musical overtones and, despite avowals otherwise throughout by the narrator, it has a powerful moral message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The play is set in the poorest parts of East London and is usually set in time just ahead of Queen Victoria’s coronation. Drawing on Charles Booth’s descriptive maps of urban poverty, it focusses on the slums and their occupants. The “vicious and semi-criminal” thieves and the whores as the black lines on Booth’s maps would have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular we follow the fortunes of Macheath, formerly a captain in the army, who prowls the streets of Whitehall with his switch blade stabbing and whoring, kept out of jail by his connections to the chief of police Tiger Brown. One evening he meets and falls in love with Polly Peachum. She is the daughter of Jeremiah Peachum, the self-proclaimed king of London’s Beggars and arch-enemy of Macheath. Mr Peachum engineers a trap to force Tiger Brown’s hand but will Macheath hang for his crimes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macheath is a charismatic invention, so charismatic that his theme song &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_the_Knife&quot;&gt;“Mack The Knife”&lt;/a&gt; has grown into a life of its own outside of the Threepenny Opera. Many people have heard the versions by Louie Armstrong or Bobby Darrin and known little of its dark meaning or the Threepenny Opera whence it came. Simon Cowell has said that it’s the best song ever written!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other great songs abound in the show. One is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Jenny&quot;&gt;“Pirate Jenny”&lt;/a&gt;, which has a phenomenal version by Nina Simone. This song is used in various ways in different stagings of the Threepenny Opera - but always in a situation in which a female character expresses her knowledge that she’ll one day revenge her oppressors. It tells of a lowly maid at an old hotel who imagines avenging herself for the contempt she endures from the townspeople. A pirate ship enters the harbour and, with its 50 cannons, flattens every building except the hotel. The pirates come ashore and kill all the townspeople by Jenny’s command. Jenny then sails away with the pirates. It’s a song that, when performed well, transports you to some other place entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third well-known song from the Threepenny Opera is the song that closes the second act. While popular versions of “Mack the Knife” and “Pirate Jenny” have crystallised those songs into particular forms, the second act finale still changes a lot depending on the staging of the play. It’s a song in which the main characters explore their motivations, namely that it’s a dog eat dog world in which a man must fight for himself in order to survive. Out of this comes a song called “What Keeps Mankind Alive?”, which didn’t feature in the National Theatre version, but has been covered by some of my favourite artists including Tom Waits, Mirah, and the Pet Shop Boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adaptation of the Threepenny Opera is similar to others I’ve experienced. This was the first I’d seen live. Up until now I’d only heard off-Broadway cast recordings on Spotify and seen excerpts of incomprehensible German versions on YouTube. There are a few knowing twists (more on these below) and I imagine the language is coarser than would have featured in the first English translations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many productions with the content of the Threepenny Opera would play up the dramatic events like drunken vomiting and bloody stabbings, they’re presented in an artificial fashion. The “vomit” is a foamy spray shot across the stage from an inartfully disguised bottle and repeated with outsize gestures for comic effect. The stabbings produce spools of red and purple wool as silly substitutes for blood and guts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staging was excellent. An arrangement of wooden frames covered in paper formed walls and stairs and these rotated around as a scene progressed. The paper walls meant that Mack could make some stabby entrances with his knife and other characters were able to burst through walls for extra dramatic entrances. This also meant that as the play progressed the stage began to break down, becoming as rickety as the plot and as run down as the London slums of its setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed all the performances. Rory Kinnear plays Mack as a spiv, a luckless villain run aground on his own impulses, and seemed to be having a whale of a time throughout. It’s not a role that needs interpretation: doing so would undermine the whole point of the show. Mack is meant to be amoral and unthinking, that’s what gives the ending its power. Nick Holder was excellent as Jeremiah Peachum holding court with a camp grimness as a transvestite King of the Beggars (think of an evil Eddie Izzard). Rosalie Craig captured both the initial simpering innocence of Polly Peachum and her steely rise to crime boss, delivering some belting tunes along the way. I also enjoyed Sharon Small’s performance as Jenny Diver. It coupled deft acting, great singing and some impeccable comic timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it was very enjoyable indeed and for £15 it seemed like a steal, particularly given our seats had such a great view of the staging and the action. The adaptation played up the artifice and the fact that no moral would be applied, even though the characters express moral opinions throughout. There’s a scene where a giant England flag is unfurled that seemed like a pointed remark about the toxic embrace of poverty and patriotism, but it didn’t really hit home for me. But as they said, it’s just entertainment: there are no morals here. Perhaps that’s the point of the Threepenny Opera after all, to hold up a mirror and then laugh as you flinch from your reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A New Notebook</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/new-notebook"/>
   <updated>2016-09-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/new-notebook</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Witness the pressure of a new notebook. You sit at your desk, trying to get it started with an amazing piece of writing. Something worthy of that crisp new page. You want it to tumble out of you, fully formed and coherent. Something that justifies you abandoning the previous one. As though first drafts don’t exist. You cast yourself into the role of shaman, of seer - of someone gifted a prophetic vision. But it’s a role that you cannot and will not fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your pen hovers on the blank lines as you try to bring forth words describing your thoughts. Everything feels stultifying and false. You feel disappointed. Here you are pressing on regardless, same as always, and those magic ringing words - the ones you hear so clearly in your head - still fail to appear on your pristine page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cap it all there are blots and mistakes everywhere. You strike through every other word as you pin your writhing sentences to the page. You’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@chrisdeerin/obama-the-butterfly-collector-af3304b1acd9#.35ws6g4bg&quot;&gt;a bad butterfly collector&lt;/a&gt;. Your net is full of holes that let the best ones get away. Worse still, the poor creatures you catch aren’t yet dead so you smudge them as you finish them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as often happens, pain turns to pleasure. Through knots of strike outs, something begins to emerge. The page is now a patchwork of sentences crisscrossed with edits in place. There are intrusions and eruptions, because you never write anything down without missing a word or two. New phrases adorn their clunky forebears and glisten with the dew of new paths made through familiar territory. Those smudges become spots, as slothful sentences evolve into &lt;a href=&quot;http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/cheetah/&quot;&gt;cheetahs&lt;/a&gt;. You are a predator now, hunting down the ideas that tried to hide from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notebook is no longer pristine, but you have your ideas written down. Even though the piece is packed with strike outs and changes, it will nonetheless be one of the neater pages that follow. Sometimes ideas resist their captors and flee at the last moment, leaving only feathers or footprints behind. Others will be larger creatures when they fail, beached on that shore of ruled lines. Your new notebook will contain many of these scraps, wisps, and impressions, but others will have the shapes of other things worth preserving.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Don't Have a Clue, part 43</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/no-clue-part-43"/>
   <updated>2016-09-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/no-clue-part-43</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A little man wearing a bow tie, and possibly a fez, scurries into the middle of the frame clutching a clapboard. Breathing heavily he hoists the clapboard up to chest height. He holds the clapper up then brings down while slurring &quot;This is a blog post about not having a clue, take 43&quot;. He exits to the right of the frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feet are hot. The bed seems too small. Why are my feet always too hot on nights like these? I bet I could sleep if my feet weren't so hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘writer’ flicks on a lamp in a dark lounge room. He sets up laptop down at the desk, arcs up the lid. He fetches a mug of milk. Tents his hands, wearily rubs his eyes and tries to type out the ideas that were keeping him awake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was the twenty minutes I spent composing a poem for our neighbours. The ones who think that because they can't hear our television, we must need to be able to hear theirs. It was actually a pretty cool poem. I thought about flooding the bedroom with light and tapping it into my phone. But each cool start slithers off into the darkness. After a while I can't remember any of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listen to some music. An album that I might write about as an understated classic. I keep hearing little bits that I've never noticed before. Not fair. This is supposed to be a chill album that I'm supposed to ignore, aural wallpaper that leaves me tangled up in my headphones when I wake up at 3AM. But nice little meandering piano line though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm so tired I have to do something. Did I mention that my feet were really hot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘writer’ feels down to his feet. He grimaces and nods to himself, they're still pretty warm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel frustrated that I can't sleep but there have been enough nights like this in my life for me to know that I can't just lie there with hot feet. Seriously though, I have really hot feet right now. I don't feel like I'm mentioning it enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on in the evening I told Ingrid that I felt so tired that I didn't know what I was doing anymore. As in anything at all. I feel like a sprite-version of Matthew running across a Super Mario platform level constantly butting into giant blocks with question marks on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to imagine a giant block of ice resting on my feet. It has precisely fifty-seven gazillion question marks laser etched into it. I figure that from certain angles it must split white light into rainbows. It is beautiful. Or at least it would be, if it were real. My feet are still really hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might expect that to be depressing or frustrating, but it's not an unhappy feeling at all. I don't feel powerless for finding the world completely unfathomable. I think it's temporary. I hope it's temporary. And even if not having a damn clue about what's going on is some sort of new normal, it doesn't really feel that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘writer’ finishes his milk. He looks at the bottom of the cup, as though disappointed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these were thoughts running around in my head, like a toy train chasing its tail on the tracks. I tried to get them down the way that they popped into my head. I even tried to write some of the poem, but that was all gone. Maybe poetry will be the thing to try next time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either that or I will have to put frozen peas on my burning feet. Did I mention that they are a bit hot?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, August 2016</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2016"/>
   <updated>2016-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2016</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in yesterday’s post, I allowed Spotify to pick some new albums for me this month. It chose some noodly ambient techno, a captivating slice of World Jazz, a moody gothic hallucination, and a concept album about humans being rescued by aliens. All in all a pretty good job! Here is the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prins Thomas “Principe del Norte”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sarathy Korwar “Day to Day”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doomsquad “Total Time”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;United Vibrations “The Myth of the Golden Ratio”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prins-thomas-principe-del-norte&quot;&gt;Prins Thomas “Principe del Norte”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/orb-alpine-diskomiks-sin-in-space-pt-2/&quot;&gt;Prins Thomas recently remixed the Orb’s “Alpine EP”&lt;/a&gt; so I’m not surprised that Spotify included one of his tracks on my Discover Weekly playlist. The connection was obviously waiting to be made. “Principe del Norte” was released back in March and features 9 tracks over almost 90 minutes. Each track title is a single letter, save the first two which are labelled A1 and A2. I think it was B that caught my attention, a proper old school ambient tune but one with some teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s go back to the beginning. A1 and A2 each unfurl slowly with rippling synth lines. Both tracks feel like cousins of one another. A2 is the darker, meatier underside of the two. I must confess about half the times I have listened to this album, I have fallen asleep by the end of these two. This is not to say that they are soporific, just pretty hypnotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B is the most complete and song-like piece on the album. It may last for nearly twelve minutes but it uses the time methodically, from a chiming start to some melodic bass lines throughout. It’s music that soundtracks you doing other things but it is also pretty enough to pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C is even longer, smearing a sneering synth sound that the Aphex Twin would be proud of all over its fourteen minutes. Toward the end there’s a euphoric little riff that’s both intense and minimal channelling Philip Glass all the while. D builds out of hissing drones and a metallic synth line into a twitchy techno track, retooling the fine filigree loops of A1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each successive track adds a new element to the overall formula and yet the tracks do not simply retread their predecessors’ ground (with the possible exception of A2 after A1). Instead they build over one another, usually using a new bass or synth line to get each track started before borrowing bits and bobs from the tracks before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E motors along on a funky Moroder-esque bass line, speeding up the initial twitchy elements of D and setting them against the charming bass lines of B. Later on it too has appropriated the chiming loops used in A1 and A2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F shuffles into your ears on a strident almost-house beat that then starts to sink under a hiss, while a bizarre rise-and-fall synth line struggles to be heard over it. It too has an almost song-like quality in places, particularly in the guitar-sounding interludes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G and H are both over thirteen minutes long. G begins as a techno stomper with doof doof beats and a wishy-washy trance synth, building delicately into something quite powerful and beautiful. It’s about as animated as ambient music can get, reminiscent of that fantastic Orb remix of Keiichi Suzuzi’s Satellite Serenade. Towards the end it shimmers into something quieter, again influenced by the ringing keyboard washes of A1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H starts with hand claps and the burbling dark synth lines that you first hear hidden in the depths of A2. It builds into a midtempo progressive house track, again flirting with the cusp of what can really be called ambient music. It’s very beaty, yet it too eventually starts to break up and fall away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principe del Norte is very satisfying as an album in its entirety because you get to hear several ideas being pulled around and fleshed out before your very ears. Every time it begins to feel familiar, you notice some new element that makes that track seem fresh and new. That said, it captures your attention rather than insists on it. As I mentioned above, it’s more music for doing things to than music that insists on being appreciated for its own sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sarathy-korwar-day-to-day&quot;&gt;Sarathy Korwar “Day to Day”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarathy Korwar is an American composer and percussionist raised in India. He plays the tabla and studied music at SOAS in London. His interests include the arrangement of traditional Indian percussion on western instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Day to Day” was part-funded by a bursary from the Steve Reid Foundation and Sarathy has received guidance from the likes of Kieran Hebden (AKA Fourtet) and Gilles Petersen. Released on Ninja Tune, a label renowned for releasing interesting material, the album blends western jazz and electronica with field recordings of Sidi musicians from India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track “Bismillah” appeared on my Discover Weekly playlist and I was struck by how unusual it sounded. This drove me to explore the whole album, of which “Bismillah” is broadly representative. Drawing on my fondness for long expansive tracks, “Bismillah” allies the field recordings to a relaxed jazz backing. It feels loose and chilled, even when things pick up in the middle. There is also a lovely little guitar line that weaves into the mix just before the five-minute mark. It’s good morning music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being built around samples of Sidi musicians, Korwar doesn’t limit himself to that particular sound palette, so “Dreaming” feels like it is from the Outback and the nagging minimal pulses of “Indefinite Leave to Remain” flesh out that loaded term. I love the shimmering guitar intro to “Karam”, which - like any beautiful piece of art - needs no context for you to simply enjoy its beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sidi people are descendents of people who migrated from Africa to India along trade routes before 1000 BCE. This makes “Day to Day” with its patchwork of migrated musical patterns an interesting comment on the power of migration to blend people and their cultures together. And yet it succeeds as interesting and captivating music despite this information about its creation. Music that brings us away from the normal and the everyday, toward new places and new thinking, is always good for the soul. This short bright album is just that sort of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doomsquad-total-time&quot;&gt;Doomsquad “Total Time”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doomsquad are a Canadian group on the Bella Union label. According to my reading “Total Time” was recorded in Mexico and inspired by local myths and customs. All I know is that this is an interesting album crammed packed with ideas, even if it does run out of steam a bit the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening track “Who Owns Noon In Sandusky?” (no, I don’t get the title either) is one of the most arresting songs I’ve heard all year. It has this sexy swivelling beat that has a bhangra/Timbaland feel to it. The lyrics are all about confronting naked beauty though they’re quite hard to parse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pyramids on Mars” takes on the gothic techno vibe, binding another compelling beat to an interesting lyric about possession and domination. The band aren’t afraid to explore the musical sound worlds of these songs, some bands feel the need to cram loads of lyrics into songs like these and it’s good that Doomsquad invest as much effort into atmosphere as they do songcraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire first half of the album is front loaded in this way. “Collective Insanity” is built not on a beat but a drone that sneers its way through the first minute of the song before the drums and vocals enter. It’s an interesting turn of pace and they manage it well, creating a truly creepy song that feels like a spectre raised from the sexy black magic of the previous two. Meanwhile “It’s the nail that counts, not the rope” manages to live up to its fantastic title, a relentless pulse building up to the shouted line of “this is the mark the fire gave me, you motherfucker!”. “Solar Ass” is probably both the best and sexiest song about a donkey ever written. Any alternative suggestions for either title on a postcard please. Any song that can get me humming “my burro / my hero / my ass” to myself while I make a cup of tea at work gets my vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some minor missteps in the second half. “Farmer’s Almanac” has a pleasant dubby feel but it drags on too long - a longer track later on feels shorter than this one. “The Very Large Array” pulses and sighs but doesn’t really go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things pick up again with “Eat the Love”. It is brimful of unsettling sounds and lyrics, throbbing with an intensity that consumes the track in a pre-chorus of “Fire”. There’s some excellent little riffs throughout and the true chorus of “Open up your mouth / and chew the sun / open up your mouth / swallow the moon” is probably the most immediate on the entire record. That just leaves “Russian Gaze”, an inessential and noisy spoken word track that closes the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t help wondering why Spotify picked out “Why Owns Noon in Sandusky?” for me. A lot of the songs on my Discover Weekly have occult or gothic themes, yet I wouldn’t necessarily think of myself as having those particular interests. Maybe I do. Maybe I should wear more black. And eyeliner. Definitely more eyeliner. That said, despite their name (and terrifying website) Doomsquad don’t seem that scary or goth to me. Just perplexing and interesting, and at the end of the day that’s probably what I like the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;united-vibrations-the-myth-of-the-golden-ratio&quot;&gt;United Vibrations “The Myth of the Golden Ratio”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite of the albums that Spotify picked out for me. I even bought a copy on vinyl. United Vibrations are a group from London who have already released a couple of albums (which I will check out soon). “The Myth of the Golden Ratio” is their coming-of-age album. It comes with a little short story that describes the concept of the album. Basically, humans in love with nature fall out of love with nature, then a shaman calls in some aliens to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put this attention on the concept because one day while we listened to it Ingrid asked if it was a musical. Up to that point I hadn’t really noticed that aspect of it, I’d just been enjoying the songs. “Sofia”, the song that Spotify had included in my playlist, is particularly good. Also, despite having words in Greek, it stands alone from the concept and therefore it’s the most accessible track on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you like concept albums or not, there are some lovely moments on “Myth…” that transcend the thread running through it. It’s not hard to hear the beautiful voices at the end of “Grow” or the joy that coruscates through the chorus of “Far Away Pt. 2”. You have to listen a wee bit harder to grasp what is being said in “Far Away Pt. 3” and to really feel the existential message of “Golden”. That message is quite profound and goes beyond the ecological theme of the album: if you find what you’re looking for, you might not know that you have because you’ll be a different person transformed by your discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you really buy into the concept then you’ll love the barmier tracks like “Scion” and “I Am We”. The chorus of the latter may not have been properly thought through and it’s deadly catchy too, don’t say I didn’t warn you. You’ll also find it hard to resist the intense drumming and chants of “Twister”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, it’s brilliant to discover an album that is so joyous and themed along self-empowerment and the desire to improve the predicament of the planet. If you’re a skeptic, you’ll find it challenging, but the rest of us will be dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spotify-playlist&quot;&gt;Spotify Playlist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All four hours of it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Adventures with Discover Weekly</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/adventures-with-discover-weekly"/>
   <updated>2016-08-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/adventures-with-discover-weekly</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because I couldn’t find any albums coming out this month that I wanted to review for the album digest, I decided to let Spotify pick the albums to listen to. I listened to my algorithmically chosen &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/20/why-browse-when-you-can-play/&quot;&gt;Discover Weekly&lt;/a&gt; playlist one week and selected albums based on the songs that I liked the most. The album also had to be released in 2016. The selections are ones that got away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done this before. &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-august-2012/&quot;&gt;Three of the four albums that I wrote about in August four years ago&lt;/a&gt; were selected by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleep.com&quot;&gt;Bleep&lt;/a&gt;: they were in the ‘best albums of the year so far’ bundle that I bought. So this month’s album digest is bought to you by the same idea, just a different curator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I find that DW is OK at finding songs that I like. It picks thirty songs a week and it cleverly doesn’t bother to change them unless you’ve listened to at least one song. You can’t decide that you don’t like the look of it, you have to give at least one song a go. That may have led me to more discoveries than anything else. Most weeks it picks at least four or five songs that I’d listen to more than once. It knows that I like long remixes and proggy instrumentals. For a while I found its selections rather morose, but it’s cheered up in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s starting to learn that I like new music too. Today &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifydiscover/playlist/2RCUVNJOvLOhcWenkt0ECQ?gtm=1&quot;&gt;I listened to an hour of this week’s DW&lt;/a&gt; and about seven of the songs were released in either July or August. You can see now why I am interested in what it might pick out for me in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the album digest I won’t conjecture as to why I ended up listening to those particular albums. I need to follow its suggestions for a bit longer before I start to analyse them. A musical prediction machines raises all sorts of questions, the kind that I like to ponder the answers to. Not least the decreasing moroseness! &lt;a href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/theslice/how-internet-algorithms-can-help-us-be-better-humans&quot;&gt;Is it making me happier?&lt;/a&gt; Am I feeding it happier data points? Or was it because I complained about it to @SpotifyCares on Twitter? Watch (or listen to) this space and perhaps I’ll figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>BBC Prom 47 at the Royal Albert Hall</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/bbc-prom-47-royal-albert-hall"/>
   <updated>2016-08-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/bbc-prom-47-royal-albert-hall</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We went to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulsterorchestra.org.uk/events/2016-08-21/&quot;&gt;Prom 47&lt;/a&gt;, an afternoon prom at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The bill included a brand new work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://piershellawell.com&quot;&gt;Piers Hellawell&lt;/a&gt;, along with a Cello concerto by &lt;a href=&quot;http://classicalmusic.about.com/od/classicalcomposers/p/haydnprofile.htm&quot;&gt;Haydn&lt;/a&gt; and a symphony by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pyotr-Ilyich-Tchaikovsky&quot;&gt;Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt;. These were all performed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulsterorchestra.org.uk&quot;&gt;Ulster Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. The conductor was Rafael Payare. The tickets were an affordable £17 each which isn’t bad at all given that we were sat in the second row of the circle. We had a great view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I did not understand Ingrid’s obsession with seeing a prom. I moaned that it would be expensive and that we’d end up having to travel either to or from London at some awkward time of day. However this prom was at a convenient time and the cheap seats had not sold out. How could I say no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The running order also fit my expectations. I think it’s just as important to celebrate new “classical” music as it is to preserve older pieces. A lot of people consider new works for the orchestra to be challenging, but this one - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/StaffGateway/News/QueensProfessorofCompositionatthe2016BBCProms.html&quot;&gt;“Wild Flow” by Piers Hellawell&lt;/a&gt; - wasn’t in the least. OK so there are a few Ligetti-esque screechy bits near the beginning and it was chock full of showy percussion but in general it’s fairly easy to listen to. At points it sounded a bit like Gershwin and at others it felt like it wanted to morph into a John Williams score. In short, it’s very listenable. I’ve listened to it again a few times on the iPlayer and I’ve loved it each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the first half was Haydn’s Cello Concerto No. 1 in C Major. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yourclassical.org/programs/performance-today/episodes/2016/06/13&quot;&gt;This was a lost piece that appeared in Haydn’s notes but was not found for almost two hundred years&lt;/a&gt;. It received its modern début in 1965. To my ears it sounded very baroque but I’m a duffer when it comes to the older stuff. Perhaps it’s just the cellos that send me to my Vivaldi comparisons. There was a charismatic soloist performing the cadenzas and he even performed an encore. Let’s just say that it went on long enough to confirm both his talent and his ego, but he’s young so a little showboating can be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the break came &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._5_(Tchaikovsky)&quot;&gt;Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 5 in E Minor&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it had more challenging moments than the modern piece, there were parts where the music didn’t quite go where I expected it too. I wasn’t too sure about all the interjections of what felt like very martial, almost militaristic music. But there were also some crowd pleasing moments and this piece was better known to the audience than it was to me. There were some lovely parts for the horns and I always admire how well Tchaikovsky writes woodwind parts in his work. For me the woodwind is a rather neglected part of the orchestra. The strings are very demonstrative, all show, but the clarinets and the oboes with their sinuous and insinuating melodies are always much more mysterious to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a very satisfying afternoon and we got some time in London out of it too. I think we might even go to another one next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can listen to the entirety of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ebw2mb#b07pdyrh&quot;&gt;Prom 47 on the BBC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, July 2016</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-july-2016"/>
   <updated>2016-07-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-july-2016</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Album Digest July 2016 consists of a bumper five albums, mainly because I couldn’t work out which one to drop. I think they’re all pretty good though it’s great to hear new music from The Avalanches after all this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bat-for-lashes-the-bride&quot;&gt;Bat For Lashes “The Bride”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For her fourth album as Bat For Lashes, Natasha Khan applies her considerable songwriting skills to a concept album. She sings from the perspective of a bride whose husband dies on his way to their wedding. Almost all artists would deliver this subject matter in a melodramatic way, but Khan focusses on the sadness and delivers a beautiful suite of songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Bride” is a slow sad album but it’s so intimate and intricate that at points it can feel as though she is in the room with you. There are few albums that I’d recommend as “headphones music” because of the vocals but this is one. Some of the songs are not the sort that you’d want to hear on a Friday night but you could say the same of songs from a particularly tragic musical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I listened to “Close Encounters” it gave me chills down my spine. It’s spooky and is a perfect fit with the subject matter, but it’s also a song that would sit just fine on any of her other albums. On other songs like the spoken word marvel “Widow’s Peak” she produces material that feels unlike anything she’s released before, so the concept hardly feels like a constraint to her talents at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, this is not going to be an album that you’ll put on for fun. Concept albums about jilted brides are always going to be a niche genre, but the fact that she managed to write such a lovely collection of songs speaks to her talent and her skill. A little more focus on before the event as well as after might add a little more drama. Her previous album “The Haunted Man” was excellent and though “The Bride” is a bit too boxed in to be thought of as highly, I think there will be plenty more great Bat For Lashes albums to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-avalanches-wildflower&quot;&gt;The Avalanches “Wildflower”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second albums are hard enough, even without allowing sixteen years to accrue since your début. To The Avalanches, who released the groundbreaking “Since I Left You” back in 2000, the business of once more producing something as inventive and fun must have seemed damn near impossible. Yet with little notice “Wildflower” appeared this month just in time to coincide with some wonderful weather (in the UK at least) and possibly claim the title of album of the summer, if not the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confess that it took me a long time to get to grips with “Since I Left You”. On release it left me cold and it wasn’t until I got hold of DJ Shadow’s Endtroducing some time later (“Endtroducing” was released back in 1997 but I missed it) that the sampling approach began to make sense to me. I suppose I was more used to artists like The KLF and The Orb constructing specific narratives with their music. The Avalanches’ more scattershot and punky approach made less sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With “Wildflower” they’ve come a little way in my direction and I’ve found it a delight to engage with. The contributions of rappers and singers really complement the instrumental samples. It reminds me of when I would flit between FM radio stations as a kid, that mixture of nostalgic music, adverts and the stuff you were really looking for. It’s languid and warm, and better still it presents an opportunity to access that sunny hedonism that characterises youth. I have no idea whether someone young enough to only know digital music would enjoy this album quite as much. The Avalanches won’t care, there must surely be enough good will associated with their début even after all this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think “Frank Sinatra” is a great little single, even though it took me a while to love it. You pretty much have to because it’s an insidious earworm that would feel like torture otherwise. “Noisy Eater” has a definite “Frontier Psychiatrist” vibe and a fantastic sample of a kid’s choir singing The Beatles’ “Come Together”. It’s joyous and if the world needs anything now, it’s more joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a series of tracks on the second half of the album that I first listened to while walking to meet Ingrid at the station. It was a warm July night, not long dark. The moon hung large in the sky and moths batted at every artificial source of light. The music that accompanied my walk felt entirely natural and gave me a complete sense of happiness and ease. I don’t think that’s an easy thing to create with music, something that ties you into a profound sense of happiness with whatever you are doing at the time you hear it. I think it’s very impressive and it just makes me wish that The Avalanches had managed to release more music in the last sixteen years. However, if they had, would the results have been this good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aphex-twin-cheetah-ep&quot;&gt;Aphex Twin “Cheetah EP”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking of long hiatuses, it appears that Aphex Twin is well and truly back. This is his fourth release in two years, another EP that was recorded entirely with one particular synth. That synth is the Cheetah MS800 of the title and has a reputation of being difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result the “Cheetah EP” lets us see two things: another example of just how talented Richard D. James is at programming his kit and an EP that has a uniform sound. It’s very much an Aphex Twin EP too, not an AFX one. But unlike “Computer Controlled Instruments Pt2” and despite the name, the focus is very much seems to be on the tunes rather than how or on what instruments they were made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This affordable Digital Wave Sequencing Synthesiser had … the honour of being one of the most unfathomable instruments ever made - it was mind numbingly confusing to program…” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gforcesoftware.com/extras/syntharchive/cheetah-ms800&quot;&gt;GForce Software&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you what it is about the synth in question or why that makes “Cheetah” a pleasant EP to listen to. All I can tell you is that the rumbling low bass lines and awkward melodies on these tracks don’t sound altogether different from others he’s released since his return. I particularly like the longer tracks like “CIRKLON3 (Kolkhoznaya mix)” and “CIRKLON1”. The EP as a whole is very accessible, probably even more so than “SYRO”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CIRKLON3 (Kolkhoznaya mix)” also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://warp.net/news/aphex-twin-cirklon3-video/&quot;&gt;a great video that is well worth checking out&lt;/a&gt;. It was directed by a 12-year-old boy and is the first official Aphex Twin video for 17 years. It looks like it was made by someone playing around with the video editing capabilities of a Mac and that’s ok if you’re 12. The whole video seems to be him and his friends enjoying and celebrating the weirdness of the Aphex Twin’s music for eight minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the EP is a compelling and interesting listen but perhaps not as earth-shaking as “SYRO” or “drukqs”, or even “Computer Controlled Instruments Pt2”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-the-wizards-sleeve-the-soft-bounce&quot;&gt;Beyond The Wizard’s Sleeve “The Soft Bounce”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond The Wizards Sleeve is the stage name of DJ Errol Alkan and former Grid member Richard Norris. They came to my notice with some really good remixes for Midlake, Tracey Thorn, Chemical Brothers and Goldfrapp. Their remixes are often drawn-out affairs that explore different facets of the original track. I’d argue that their version of Midlake’s “Roscoe” is better than the original, it’s certainly why I love Midlake’s “Trials of Von Occupanther” album so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Soft Bounce” is their first album of their own material. It has a psychedelic rock vibe, beginning with a trippy instrumental “Delicious Light”. That said, “Iron Age” is much rockier and sounds a lot like the Klaxons. Meanwhile there’s a great Stereolab/Broadcast vibe to “Creation”, as close as a British band has come to replicating the Brazilian tropicalia sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not all successful and I prefer the instrumental tracks. “Door To Tomorrow” initially sounds like a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; Klaxons song before deciding to sound like a bad Badly Drawn Boy song. “Diagram Girl” has a great backing track but the vocal is not substantial enough to make a lasting impact. Meanwhile “Black Crow” has a wonderful 70s cop show intro, but it soon starts to sound like Little Dragon singing a Bond theme commissioned by Lidl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the instrumentals are better. “Tomorrow, Forever” stretches woozily over seven minutes and in the recent heat has made me feel like the world is melting all around me. It’s the aural equivalent of standing in the ruins of an old abbey, the walls stretch up around you but there’s no roof and you blind yourself peering into the blazing sun. I admit that a whole album of this type of music might not be super-interesting, but neither is sounding like Turin Brakes on dodgy ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title track is also good and pleasing because it veers off in all directions in a daring way. When you listen to this track you can see the benefits of BTWS moving beyond remix work, as here they take something and smash it wide open. If you tried that while remixing a big name artist, they’d probably send it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Finally First” sounds like a mellower twin of “Setting Sun” by the Chemical Brothers - though that precise record already exists in the form of the Chemicals’ own “Sunshine Underground”. Nevertheless it bleeds through another short track to the final and best track, “Third Mynd”, which marries a spoken word description of what it’s like to take LSD to a confused backing. It sounds pretty much exactly how you’d expect it to and listening to it at the traffic lights on your way home from work is very weird indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Soft Bounce” is a decent début but Beyond The Wizard’s Sleeve would do well to focus on the tracks that bring the weirdness to the surface, rather than trying to suppress it. supressed weirdness is what remixes are for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;islands-taste&quot;&gt;Islands “Taste”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally the second of Islands’ two 2016 albums: “Taste”. I said in last month’s album digest that I didn’t have much time to properly digest “Should I Remain Here At Sea?”. I managed to properly digest “Taste”, mainly because it’s brilliant - an album that’s both different to and superior to its companion. I think I’ve reviewed them in the correct order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d lamented that the weird multi-structures I remembered from previous Islands albums were mostly missing from “Should I…?”. Well “Taste” begins with “Charm Offensive”, an appealing song that employs some interesting tricks to worm its way into your heart. One is to perform the first run through of the chorus as an instrumental. Another is to have brilliant lyrics. Another is to collapse in to weird coda. Great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No Milk, No Sugar” is based off some chunky 80s synth, to the extent that it makes me think of Yazoo. Again it employs that trick of getting the synths to wordlessly prime you for the upcoming musical lines. It’s one of those rallying cries for whatever cause you want to believe in, with suitably vague lyrics, but is no worse for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Carried Away” is a soft sweet song that soars into the evening sky, while “It’s Heaven” introduces guitars to a slow song that gathers pace and builds into an anthem by the end. If The Decembrists ever pastiched 80s pop as well as university level literature, they’d sound like Islands do on these tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights are “Outspoken Dirtbiker” (what a title!), “Snowflake” (far funkier than a song with that title should be) and “The Joke” (darker and more apocalyptic than anything on the rest of the album).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is one great album that you could shake out of these two Islands albums, but given how different each album sounds compared to the other the result might be a bit uneven. I’d say that “Taste” has the slightly larger share of great songs, though it also suffers from not having songs like “Back Into It”, “Innocent Man” and “Sun Conure”. Nevertheless, with two albums I feel spoiled for choice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-month&quot;&gt;Next month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure what’s coming next month. I’m definitely going to write about the Prins Thomas album “Principe del Norte” which I’ve only just discovered (It was released in February 2016). I’ve not seen much else due out that I fancy reviewing so I may go back and pick up a few more releases from earlier in the year. There’s also a new Orb EP out, but that will get a separate post like the other two (&lt;a href=&quot;/the-orb-sin-in-space-pt-1/&quot;&gt;“Sin In Space Pt. 1”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/orb-alpine-ep/&quot;&gt;“Alpine EP”&lt;/a&gt;) did.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Richard Beard, Acts of the Assassins</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/acts-of-the-assassins"/>
   <updated>2016-07-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/acts-of-the-assassins</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterstones.com/book/acts-of-the-assassins/richard-beard/9780099592938&quot;&gt;Acts of the Assassins&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting novel by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardbeard.info&quot;&gt;Richard Beard&lt;/a&gt; that retells the story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle_(Christian)&quot;&gt;the apostles&lt;/a&gt; and their deaths. It uses a modern crime genre style and a contemporary setting. The author himself refers to it as “Gospel Noir”.
Cassius Gallio, a Roman CSI-type referred to as a speculator, investigates the murders of the apostles following the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Gallio, charged with guarding the body following Jesus’ death and greatly undermined by the disappearance of the body, views the resurrection as the greatest conspiracy of the age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s even stranger and more interesting than that because the novel unfolds in a superposition of past and present. Rather than updating every aspect of the story of the apostles and then bending the story to suit, Beard instead allows the action to progress regardless. If a narrative event requires a modern element of the story to proceed, then the modern version is used. When the story needs a more traditional take, that gets used. This means that the novel is neither a simple rehash of alleged events, nor an irreverent attempt to update them. The meaning of the events is the same either way, so why not superimpose the two versions of the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern setting allows for some fun to be had with the narrative involving stakeouts, the DNA testing of glass fragments from Joseph of Arimathea’s house, and the general crapness of English roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it doesn’t mean that things are easy to follow. By about halfway through things get rather confusing. When Gallio arrives at the scene of Philip’s death in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibleplaces.com/hierapolis/&quot;&gt;Hierapolis&lt;/a&gt;, he sees it with modern eyes and so there is “already” a martyrium at the scene. During the course of the novel the bones of the apostle James &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.santiagodecompostela.gal&quot;&gt;make their way to Spain and become venerated&lt;/a&gt;, even though this is within weeks or months of his death. But simultaneously those bones have been venerated there for over a thousand years because the novel is set in our modern timeline. America is referenced and appears to be no different from in our reality, which seems improbable given how much of its identity stems from Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deaths aren’t easy to stomach. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beyondtheyalladog.com/2012/07/simon-the-zealot-complete-with-saw/&quot;&gt;Don’t read Chapter 7 before bed&lt;/a&gt;. The gothic noir narrative and modern setting allow known events to retain their tension. You might know the overall outcome (chapters are named for the disciple who has died or is about to) but the graft of events on to the new timeline and the interior story of Cassius Gallio are both unknown to the reader. The confusion about the timelines is part of the fun.
Whether you enjoy the entirety of the novel will depend on how you feel about the author’s sensitivity and attentiveness to the original legends, in particular their meaning. Why update the stories of the apostles in the first place? After all, if it were simply a case of retelling the story with a gumshoe detective &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yuks&quot;&gt;for yuks&lt;/a&gt;, then surely it would be better to shake out more of the temporal inconsistencies? I think the superposition dares us to see the parallels between events then and events today, but also draws out of us how unprepared we are to believe in the more supernatural elements of the original story.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #33: Embrya by Maxwell</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-33"/>
   <updated>2016-07-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-33</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I give the impression of planning these posts but to be honest I came across an article about Maxwell a few weeks ago and fondly remembered my cassette copy of this album. The joy of Spotify is that it’s easy to dig up old favourites. The recent warm weather makes for a good opportunity to enjoy the sultry embrace of “Embrya” once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gestation: Mythos” burbles along for two and a half minutes, overlaying spoken word samples, string phrases and weird underwater noises, before the bass line of “Everwanting: To Want You To Want” brings things to life. Over a sinuous and aquatic background, Maxwell delivers a smooth and soulful vocal. As you might guess from the title, it’s definitely one for your late nights and warm evenings playlist. I love the way that the song takes its time: it knows where it needs to go, it knows how to get there, and damned if it isn’t going to enjoy itself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, that sums up most of this wonderful languid album. “I’m You: You Are Me And We Are You” throws Spanish lyrics in to the mix too, also shuffling along on a downtempo beat. The mixture of dub and R&amp;amp;B feels so natural I’m surprised that it’s not proved to be more popular. Perhaps it’s so relaxing that it doesn’t urge you out to the store to buy it, certainly “Luxury:Cococure” received a lot of airplay (you main even find the main riff to sound familiar) but this album was a flop. At least back in 1998 when selling &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; a million copies was considered a flop. It’s a shame because “Matrimony: Maybe You” was a minor radio hit and should have been the soundtrack to many a first dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourites is “Drowndeep:Hula” because it steps back from the groove and the attempts at producing singles. Instead we get a sweet and intimate song that’s built up from a slow beat. I’m tempted to say it sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/22/lovers-rock-story-reggae&quot;&gt;Lover’s Rock&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a wonderful instrumental arrangement and I’d like to hear a fully instrumental version of this one day. Tellingly, it’s a co-write with Stuart Matthewman who is famous with his work with Sade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Arroz con pollo” is a short brassy instrumental that feels a bit like intermission music, albeit funky intermission music. It sets up a rather strange second half of the record. “Know These Things: Shouldn’t You” has a really strange air of condemnation and mystery, which feels out of place on an album that’s been focussed almost entirely on the sheets so far. Still the variety is welcome and the string arrangement is killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Submerge: Til We Become the Sun” and “Gravity: Pushing to Pull” keep up the groove, “Embrya” is a pretty consistent album in that regard, one that you can allow to flow over you. Like other albums in my understated classics series (&lt;a href=&quot;/uc16/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/uc21/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) this is a collection of songs that will lull you to sleep in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album closes with the title track which reverses the opening one, so you can put the whole thing on repeat all and listen to it go round and round all night.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>South America, Part 12</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-12"/>
   <updated>2016-07-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-12</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;uyuni-to-tupiza&quot;&gt;Uyuni to Tupiza&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Uyuni the night after the big storm, having stopped just a day or so to visit the salt flats. Our next stop was a strategic stay in Tupiza, a large town encircled with red hills. It resembled many towns that I visited in South America: low buildings arranged in a grid pattern. Not much greenery and plenty of dust billowing about. The reason for our stay was strategic, it’s only a short distance to the notoriously fussy border between Bolivia and Argentina. We would leave at 5am the next morning so we would reach the border early in case of a long delay, which can happen at this border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our stay was functional we ended up in dorms, with James and I bundled in with the three snoring Japanese pensioners. Perhaps it was knowing that I needed to wake up at five, perhaps it was the droning companions, but I did not sleep too well. Nevertheless we did get time to have a quick poke around Tupiza, which was nicer than a lot of other places you might use to get a good start at a border. A brass band played in the main square. The internet café was cheap. A sleepy restaurant still on holidays served us chicken and chips. Sarah bought a Spanish copy of Monopoly at a market. Friendly dogs ambled around. It was a place between places, but it was good to be there with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/01-Red-hills-of-Tupiza.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bolivia-argentina-border&quot;&gt;The Bolivia-Argentina border&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borders suck. It takes at least three hours for the Argentinians to accept that we Brits and our Aussie, Belgian and Dutch allies aren’t about to commit some nefarious subterfuge. We’re allowed in. The border’s there to enforce Argentina’s economic strength relative to Bolivia, but we see trade happening laissez-faire between both countries. We mill around in the no-man’s-land between them and wonder if it was worth missing breakfast for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/02-Kelly-at-the-border.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-to-salta&quot;&gt;On to Salta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we hurtle into Argentina on improved roads it is obvious that we are leaving the redness of Southern Bolivia behind us. The world around us begins to turn green. Initially there are some weird and wonderful geological patterns in the hills. Meanwhile, the houses at the sides of the roads become recognisably European, perhaps for the first time since Ecuador (bar the odd pocket like Miraflores in Lima).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/03-Patterned-hills.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start to see roadside shrines to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauchito_Gil&quot;&gt;Gauchito Gil&lt;/a&gt;, a man described as Argentina’s Cowboy patron saint. They’re small, about the size of dog kennels, but are decorated with red flags so you can see them coming a way off. Gauchito Gil was an Argentinian Robin Hood figure, which you can read about in the wikipedia article I linked to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway to Salta we stop at a service station. I marvel at the fact that the toilet flushes, something I haven’t seen outside of a hotel room for about a month. I wash my hands and buy ice cream, because it’s hot and there’s ice cream. I laugh because it’s January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;salta-and-the-dodgy-campsite&quot;&gt;Salta and the dodgy campsite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the camp site late in the evening. We gawked at the enormous pool that snaked through the grounds but alas people were draining it ready for cleaning. Similar attention to the toilets would have been preferable as the showers didn’t work and the squat toilets were filthy (even for squat toilets!). For its city centre location the campsite was quite quiet but the noise of the traffic was something new as we’d often camped in remoter places than this. I imagine it is a more fun and lively place when the pool is full!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next morning with a horrible rash down my arms and legs. I decided I’d get a hotel room for the second night (we were due to stay for three) just so I could get a shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/05-Ew-look-at-my-rash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the dodgy camp site, Salta is a wonderful place. It’s probably the liveliest place we’ve been to since Cusco (though only because La Paz was dead on New Year’s Day) and seems a place of genuine excitement and opportunity. Like Cuenca in Ecuador, it’s a place you could imagine living if you had the chance. And as with Cuenca, you get the feeling that there’d be opportunities to do so that didn’t simply revolve around tourism or its proximity to a border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of nice cathedrals, there are loads of places to eat steak and there’s a cable car up to a nearby hill where you can look down on the whole city. I get ripped off by a taxi driver but that’s just another reason to think I’m in a normal city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/06-Campsite-seen-from-high-above-Salta.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-salta-to-san-pedro-de-atacama&quot;&gt;From Salta to San Pedro de Atacama&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey from Salta to San Pedro de Atacama began calmly as it was Mim’s birthday the night before and most of my fellow travellers stayed out all night with the aim of sleeping on the truck the following day. I should have done the same as I ended up with another itchy night in the tent. That said, I was excited to get moving again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-argentina-chile-border&quot;&gt;The Argentina-Chile Border&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greenness of Argentina began to give way to the Atacama desert, one of the driest places on Earth. There are spots where it hasn’t rained since record-keeping began, well over a hundred years. Where we crossed the border of Chile and Argentina, there wasn’t much around us, just desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the hostility and remoteness of the border crossing breeds hostility and remoteness into the staff who manned it. They stonewalled us throughout and we didn’t really have much feedback about what was going on. Both nations were as bad as each other, the Chileans’ absurd need to scan every bit of luggage for food somehow complemented by the Argentineans’ outright hostility. It made for a thoroughly irritating and dull three hours. If I could remember the name of the crossing dear reader I’d state it here so you know exactly which one to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/07-Selfie-of-boredom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;san-pedro-de-atacama&quot;&gt;San Pedro de Atacama&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road to San Pedro de Atacama was therefore pretty dusty and sandy. There were a few picturesque hills and mountains along the way, not to mention a minefield that exists due to continuing tensions between Chile and Bolivia over their border. (The War of The Pacific between Chile and Bolivia during the 1880s ended badly for the latter as they had to cede all their access to the ocean and ended up landlocked. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/01/economist-explains-21&quot;&gt;It’s something that continues to rumble on between the two nations&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/08-On-the-way-to-San-Pedro-de-Atacama.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More interesting are the winding loops of road that lead you up and over the Andes once more. I loved how the roads undulated and swept over the contours, leaving trails and loops behind us. I imagine they must be great fun to experience in a car too, close down to the road, taking every curve as though it were a corner of the world’s most remote race circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/09-Undulating-road.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in San Pedro de Atacama, we quickly pitched our tents in the dusty campsite and set out to get food. There was an immediate sense that San Pedro de Atacama is a major destination for travellers, it had the atmosphere of a poorly kept secret and was quite gaudy and commercial. We fetched out weird plasticky money from the cash machines and ate pizza in a cute courtyard. After beers we staggered back to the campsite in near pitch darkness. I fell asleep immediately but when the beer got me back up again later in the night, I stood in the warm night between the tent and the toilet block and stared up at the stars. I was content once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moon-valley&quot;&gt;Moon Valley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between things like blogging at the internet café and sitting down to watch a film in the town square, we went on two big trips while in San Pedro de Atacama. The first was to the Moon Valley, a large area of geological interest just outside of the town. It’s beautiful and I don’t think I’ve been anywhere else like it. I’ll let the photos speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/moon-valley-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/moon-valley-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/moon-valley-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/moon-valley-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-altiplano-lakes&quot;&gt;The Altiplano Lakes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we took another excursion up to the Altiplano, a higher altitude part of the Atacama region. First we visited a local church, then we visited a lake where flamingos stood around as flamingos are wont to do. Finally we visited a number of higher altitude lakes that were beautiful and from which Vicunas stood and sipped the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/altiplano-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/altiplano-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/altiplano-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_12/altiplano-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-part&quot;&gt;Next part&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the trip takes in the journey to Santiago. I didn’t take many photos on this part of the trip so it may be a shorter post.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. G. Ballard, The Unlimited Dream Company</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-unlimited-dream-company"/>
   <updated>2016-07-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-unlimited-dream-company</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/high-rise/&quot;&gt;I last wrote about a JG Ballard novel nearly three years ago&lt;/a&gt;. That one - “High-Rise” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/20/high-rise-review-ben-wheatley-jg-ballard-tom-hiddleston&quot;&gt;has since been made into a film&lt;/a&gt;. The subject of this post is “The Unlimited Dream Company”, my favourite among his novels: a silly romp through suburban sexual repression that glitters with sinister wit. Even after many read-throughs I still can’t work out whether it is a crazy masterpiece or something light that we’re meant to throw away after reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel opens with the narrator Blake telling us that he is walking alone through an abandoned &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepperton&quot;&gt;Shepperton&lt;/a&gt;. All the inhabitants have fled, replaced by large flocks of exotic birds. Blake claims that this same thing will happen all over the world, that the human colonies will be replaced by giant aviaries. The story then flashes back to one week before as Blake steals a Cessna and crashes it into the Thames near Shepperton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/551354163&amp;amp;color=%23151b08&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Unlimited Dream Company” fuses the mad apocalyptic streak that runs through many of Ballard’s novels like &lt;a href=&quot;/the-drowned-world/&quot;&gt;“The Drowned World”&lt;/a&gt; to the monomaniacal psychoses of novels like &lt;a href=&quot;/concrete-island/&quot;&gt;“Concrete Island”&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways it is the high point of his writing, a fanciful ascent to the heights of surrealism on the thermals of his clipped, precise writing. Its plot mirrors the art of writing: Blake seeks to transform the mundane into the beautiful, ideating a new world of existence from the ruins of his own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first Blake attempts to escape Shepperton (listen to the audio clip below) but is thwarted at every attempt. Busses fail to arrive, noisy traffic jams convene on the streets, and even the wildlife conspires against him. Blake begins to accept his fate and resolves to stay with the family who rescued him from the river. All the while allusions are made to a skeleton still at the controls of the downed plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later chapters unfold into a bizarre psychosexual drama in which he feels attracted to almost every female he encounters, and experiences an antithetical clash of egos with almost every male. Ballard reduces his self-absorbed and preening character to that of a mere animal, one that is peacock-like in his vanity and paranoia. As all this occurs, large numbers of birds begin to arrive in the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/551355168&amp;amp;color=%2320868a&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with &lt;a href=&quot;/crash/&quot;&gt;“Crash”&lt;/a&gt;, Ballard skewers the reader’s voyeurism and feeds it to a narrative that becomes more and more like a weird dream that turns bad. Whether you persevere will depend on your stomach for weirdness, but I think it’s worth it. Blake is an unpleasant character with few redeeming features but I find him quite compelling. It’s a character trope that Ballard has a knack for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel ends up as a meditation on death and on whether or not our lives have any meaning. With the possible exception of “High-Rise”, I think it addresses its subject matter better than any previous Ballard novel I have read. I’m not sure what to make of a preening and deluded self-appointed messiah absorbing the entire population of a leafy London satellite town into his body but it’s a gripping read. It doesn’t quite have the wry social commentary of “High-Rise” or “Crash”, but it’s an important exploration of surrealism nonetheless. Perhaps with the eighties approaching, culture had become so surreal that Ballard had no choice but to throw in everything he could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would (kind of) revisit this idea again in a short story about ten years later. “Memories of the Space Age” features a small number of delusional characters roving around a deserted Florida, fighting off escaped zoo animals and musing upon a future that has departed without them. This story has a similar feel to “The Unlimited Dream Company” and also similar subject matter to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_America&quot;&gt;the next novel in this sequence: “Hello America”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Already I saw us rising into the air, fathers, mothers and their children, our ascending flights swaying across the surface of the earth, benign tornados hanging from the canopy of the universe, celebrating the last marriage of the animate and the inanimate, of the living and the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Swaptastic Part 3: The Shiny App</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The shiny app embedded below allows you to explore the number of packets you need to complete the Panini sticker album for this summer’s Euro tournament. This builds on the results I presented in an &lt;a href=&quot;link to earlier post&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; and allows you to explore how many fewer packets you need to buy when you have more friends to swap with. You can also vary the number of runs performed because the model runs considerably slower with more swappers involved.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, June 2016</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-june-2016"/>
   <updated>2016-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-june-2016</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Album Digest June 2016 is a poppy batch of albums. We have the return of my long-time favourites Roxette and the heroes of my South American tour Tegan &amp;amp; Sara. There’s some dance music in the form of Flume’s album “Skin”: an Australian presence ahead of the new Avalanches album next month. Finally there is the first of two new albums by Islands - both were released back in May but one gets reviewed this month and the other next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;roxette-good-karma&quot;&gt;Roxette “Good Karma”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve loved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roxette.se&quot;&gt;Roxette&lt;/a&gt; since I was about ten years old. The first album I ever owned was “Look Sharp!” (&lt;a href=&quot;/uc12/&quot;&gt;Understated Classic #12&lt;/a&gt;) and although my interest waxes and wanes, I usually check in on them when they release new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album is pretty much what you’d expect from a pop band that’s been going for over thirty years - they’re having fun and they want you to have fun. It’s nowhere near as good as their best stuff, but Marie can’t sing as much as she used to due to previous health problems. When she does contribute it lifts everything, although in some places it sounds like she’s been sampled off old records. Whether or not this is really the case I don’t know, but it would be typically self-referential if they were. Whatever the circumstances there aren’t many songs here that you’d put on the next nostalgic hits compilation they release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless they are still game and they’ve at least made an attempt to be current. None of the songs are guitar based and they’re all very studio-centric. Sometimes they pull off some of the old magic by sheer force of will, as on opener “Why Dontcha” and the rollicking “20BPM”. At other points sentiment wins the day, like on “Some Other Summer” (a conciliatory song about teenage heartbreak) and “Why Don’t You Bring Me Flowers?” (in which Marie offers to buy you sweater, one as soft as moonlight). Unfortunately you get the odd bit of naff “old geezers do naff R&amp;amp;B” as well, like on the verses of “You Make It Sound So Simple”, but at least they’re still trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it’s nice that Roxette continue to make new music but “Good Karma” is not that essential to your world, unless you want a few new tracks to freshen up your mega playlist on Spotify. I’d recommend “It Just Happens”, “Why Don’t You Bring Me Flowers?”, “20 BPM”, and “April Flowers”. As Marie sings on that last track: “I wish you all the best”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tegan--sara-love-you-to-death&quot;&gt;Tegan &amp;amp; Sara “Love You To Death”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teganandsara.com&quot;&gt;Tegan &amp;amp; Sara’s&lt;/a&gt; last album “Heartthrob” ended up as one of my favourite albums of 2014. Though it was released in 2013, I didn’t buy until I was in Argentina in 2014. I discovered it when I began to play “Closer” loads on my iPad Nano. I ended up playing “Heartthrob” to death on the truck during the rest of the tour, there was something about it that got to the heart of my quest for reinvention. I think when I left for South America, I didn’t really know if I was going to change who I was, or whether or not I needed to, but after a few listens of “Closer” I understood that I did and that I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a strong emotional connection to a particular album, it can be difficult to build a similar connection to that artist’s later material. I think that is the case for me with “Love You To Death”. It has the same structure as “Closer”: ten immaculate pop songs last well under forty minutes. Every song is precise and clever, not outstaying its welcome and contributing to a sugar rush of the kind that only the best pop music can provide. Just as with “Closer” there are three or four outstanding songs. By this I mean songs that you could consider to be classics, that you could put into books about pop songwriting as examplars of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Boyfriend” plays out the illicit side of a love triangle and is a thrilling rush of sexy innuendo and desire. “100x” delivers heartbreak and devastation at the end of a relationship in a mature yet soul-destroying way, one of those rare songs that is lovely despite its emotional charge rather because of it. “Stop Desire” is about as horny as a song can get before becoming so overt that it bores, it’s exciting and titilating rather than lascivious or crude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other songs are fun too, I especially like how “BWU” playfully pokes fun at gay marriage (“I don’t need a white wedding”). It’s empowering music that embraces all sexualities and orientations whilst being overtly and cheerfully queer. It’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see where Tegan &amp;amp; Sara go next. Repeating “Closer” was OK because it was such a great album and managing to produce such a close companion with “Love You To Death” is no mean feat. It’s clear that they are among the best pop song writers around at the moment and hopefully they can step forward again next time out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flume-skin&quot;&gt;Flume “Skin”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m aware this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flumemusic.com&quot;&gt;Flume’s&lt;/a&gt; second album. I added his self-titled debut album to my Spotify back when it was released but I never managed to find the time to listen to it. I think I will go back to it after hearing “Skin”, an album that’s not perfect but does have some interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with “Skin” is that it is a bit patchy. There’s no real plan, so it feels like an uneven listen. Individual songs are great but as I listened to the entirety of the album I felt like I might enjoy the songs more as part of a playlist or mix alongside other artists’ songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying that Flume is a talented artist. He manages to make a track featuring Busta Rhymes sound interesting, something I’d’ve thought wasn’t possible. On the other hand the album features six different female vocalists but you’d be hard pressed to tell each of their songs from any of the others (A possible exception is Little Dragon, because I know their work and the voice of their singer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting tracks are the instrumental vignettes. In particular “Wall Fuck”, “3”, “Pika” and “Free” are all really good. “Pika” sounds like Battles, which is always get a track into my good books. Elsewhere there’s a collaboration with Beck, which sounds exciting but it’s more of “Morning Phase” or “Modern Guilt” kind of Beck that shows up, when you desperately want it to be an “Odelay” kind of Beck just to pick things up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Skin” is good album rather than a great one. I can hear the potential for a great album within these tracks but there’s also a frustrating lack of direction at some points. I wonder if Flume can direct his talents toward something more cohesive next time and, dare I say it, a little more fun? (Also, I wonder what that first album sounds like?…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;islands-should-i-remain-here-at-sea&quot;&gt;Islands “Should I Remain Here At Sea?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have much to say about the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://islandsareforever.com&quot;&gt;Islands&lt;/a&gt; album “Should I Remain Here At Sea?” at the moment, save to say that I’ve listened to it through a couple of times and enjoyed it. It’s one of two albums recently released by the band. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/islands&quot;&gt;Both were crowdfunded&lt;/a&gt;. This one is meant to be a sequel in spirit to their debut “Return To Sea” and it’s very straightforward and rocky. I’ll be reviewing the other album “Taste” next month. It’s meant to be more electronic but I haven’t listened to it all yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember “Return To Sea” as being more tricky and complex than anything on “Shall I Remain Here At Sea?”. A case in point is the opening track on each album. “Return To Sea” begins with “Swans”, which stretches over nine and a half minutes while twisting and turning over itself multiple times. “Shall I Remain Here At Sea?” begins with a three minute song called “Back Into It” that does pretty much what it says on the tin: it reintroduces you to a more straightforward version of the Islands sound in order to get you back into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs on “Shall I Remain Here At Sea?” don’t deviate too far from that template. They don’t have any titles as strange and funny as “Don’t Call Me Whitney, Bobby” but the songs are as poppy and fun as that one. I can hear the similarities between “Return To Sea” and this album, though nostalgia may drive me back to the parent over the child. Nevertheless, there is also some sweet and simple stuff that I wasn’t expecting. “Sun Conure” is a very cute little song that would be an ideal accompaniment to a caipirinha at sunset on a Brazilian beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to listening to “Taste” as well and I hope I will write more about both albums in next month’s album digest.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Swaptastic Part 2</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/swaptastic-part-2"/>
   <updated>2016-06-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/swaptastic-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to my post about the &lt;a href=&quot;/euro-2016-panini-stickers/&quot;&gt;Euro 2016 Panini Stickers&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve now completed the collection with &lt;a href=&quot;/swaptastic-part-1/&quot;&gt;the help of an online swapping site&lt;/a&gt; and by buying the last 39 stickers directly from Panini. I also managed to write a new simulator, this time with additional collectors involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume that each of N collectors will buy a packet of stickers and add any new stickers to their album. Then they attempt to swap any leftovers with the rest of their friends. The intersect function in R makes this pretty easy to code up. Every collector who finishes the album stops buying stickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the R code for a single simulation of the swapping algorithm, with defaults for the Euro 2016 album:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;stickerswaps &amp;lt;- function(number.collectors=2, number.stickers=680,
pack.size=5, packs.purchased=1, target.collections=1, cutoff=50)
{
  pack.price&amp;lt;-0.5
  collections&amp;lt;-array(0,c(number.collectors,number.stickers))
  number.complete.collections&amp;lt;-0
  total.number.swapped&amp;lt;-0
  number.rounds&amp;lt;-1

  # we set a flag to once a collector has completed the album
  # later we can change this to when all but one collector has completed

  while(number.complete.collections&amp;lt;target.collections)
  {
    for(i in 1:number.collectors)
    {
      if(sum(collections[i,]!=0)&amp;lt;=number.stickers-cutoff)
      {
        new.stickers&amp;lt;-sample(1:number.stickers,pack.size*packs.purchased)
        collections[i,new.stickers]&amp;lt;-collections[i,new.stickers]+1
      }
    }

    # After acquiring new stickers, each possible pair of collectors exchanges their swaps
    for (i in 1:number.collectors-1)
    {
      potential.swappers=(i+1):number.collectors
      for (j in potential.swappers)
      {
        # each collector works out which stickers they need
        need.i&amp;lt;-which(collections[i,]==0)
        need.j&amp;lt;-which(collections[j,]==0)
        # each collector works out their swaps
        swaps.i&amp;lt;-which(collections[i,]&amp;gt;1)
        swaps.j&amp;lt;-which(collections[j,]&amp;gt;1)
        # now work out what j has for i
        exchange.jtoi&amp;lt;-intersect(swaps.j,need.i)
        # and what i has for j
        exchange.itoj&amp;lt;-intersect(swaps.i,need.j)
        # how many do we swap?
        number.swapped&amp;lt;-min(c(length(exchange.itoj),length(exchange.jtoi)))
        # update the collections and the total number swapped across all pairs
        if (number.swapped&amp;gt;0) {
          total.number.swapped&amp;lt;-total.number.swapped+number.swapped
          # NB this assumes collectors always swap the lowest number stickers first
          collections[i,exchange.jtoi[1:number.swapped]]&amp;lt;-collections[i,exchange.jtoi[1:number.swapped]]+1
          collections[j,exchange.jtoi[1:number.swapped]]&amp;lt;-collections[j,exchange.jtoi[1:number.swapped]]-1
          collections[j,exchange.itoj[1:number.swapped]]&amp;lt;-collections[j,exchange.itoj[1:number.swapped]]+1
          collections[i,exchange.itoj[1:number.swapped]]&amp;lt;-collections[i,exchange.itoj[1:number.swapped]]-1
        }
      }
    } # end of swaps

    # increment the number of rounds
    number.rounds&amp;lt;-number.rounds+1

    # calculate the number of complete collections
    number.complete.collections=sum(rowSums(collections!=0)&amp;gt;=(number.stickers-cutoff))
  } # end of while loop

  return(c(number.rounds*packs.purchased,total.number.swapped/number.collectors))
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the benefit to a collector of having a friend to swap with? The figure below compares someone collecting alone to a collector with one single friend to swap with. As I mentioned last time, the single collector has to buy about 340 packets of stickers on average. Meanwhile, someone with a sticker swapping buddy has to buy about 240 packs of stickers on average - that’s a hundred fewer packets of stickers on average. The value of a friend is about £50!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/1vs2collectors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then increased the number of collectors. As you can see from the figure below, the distribution creeps ever leftward and tightens up around the mean. The larger your friendship group, the closer you get to only having to buy enough packets of stickers to fill the album. This makes sense if the stickers are equally rare: you should be able to exchange your swaps with those belonging to your friends. Note that this shows the number of packets that the first collector has to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/FirstCollector.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at a similar graph for the penultimate collector to finish. I chose the second-to-last collector because the last person has no one to swap with. You will see that these distributions overlap a lot more. The unluckiest player in the 10 collector scenario has to buy as many stickers as the luckiest players in the 3 collector scenario. As each collector finishes it becomes an N-1 collector scenario for the remaining collectors and this will involve buying more packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/PenultimateCollector.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s look at the distributions for how many stickers each collector has to collect when there are five of them. On average the last collector to finish has to buy about forty more packets of stickers than the first collector to finish. The final collector also has a much wider range of possible outcomes as it will depend on how close to finishing she is when her friends complete their collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/All5Collectors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 3 will look at what happens when the stickers are not equally rare.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>In the space between this and that</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/in-the-space-between-this-and-that"/>
   <updated>2016-06-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/in-the-space-between-this-and-that</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Britain voted to leave the EU this week. It made for an angry and confused Friday morning. I posted snippy comments on Facebook at a rate of about one every fifteen minutes. I also knew that there was nothing I could do. Even when you feel like Charlton Heston at the end of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, you have to suck it up and accept that sometimes things don't go as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I wonder whether the other side would accept this result. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/voters-using-their-own-pens-at-the-polls-after-wild-warnings-of/&quot;&gt;The ones who wanted to use pens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/24/remember-that-time-nigel-farage-said-52-48-votes-should-lead-to-second-referendum-5963900/&quot;&gt;The ones who claimed that a 52-48 margin in the other direction would require a re-run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm lucky. I can afford to adjust to the new normal. I worry for those who cannot. I'm well-educated with an in-demand skill set, I'm white, and I'm male. I'm not heterosexual (not that it's any of your business), but I do have a beautiful girlfriend so I can look like it. I can pass unnoticed, not be recognised as different by the newly emboldened wreckers of the status quo. Given the recent excoriation of experts, I should probably dumb down for pub quizzes though. I only fear what I will have to endure in the defence of others, not for what might happen to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise that there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/divided-britain-brexit-money-class-inequality-westminster&quot;&gt;a growing disconnect in British society&lt;/a&gt;, one that exacerbates an already schizophrenic national character. It is a mindset reaches for invention and discovery with one hand, while clutching tight to tradition with the other. I am writing a long blog post about how social networks are carving us up into walled-off tribes that cannot see one another. I think it is this collective unseeing, the collective denying of the unattractive other, that has allowed us to sleepwalk into this (inter)national tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to fix things. But I think I want to talk to people more now, not less. I am going to start with people who agree with me. I've noted the houses on my street that, like mine, displayed remain posters over the last few weeks. I will write them nice letters that offer commiseration and solidarity. I will invite them over for a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I will try to go beyond my remain bubble. This is no longer a world in which one can feel secure against hatred, but it cannot be one in which we become afraid to talk to one another and afraid to listen to one another. I don't want to limit my perspectives to cosy narratives about innate human solidarity or resort to easy put-downs about intelligence. I want to understand the issues and concerns that brought us to this point even if they are unpalatable to me. At least at the moment I do, because otherwise I'm just at a complete loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Envelopes containing swaps that have arrived in the post in recent days. It is nice to get letters from all over the country, even if they do just contain a selection of &lt;a href=&quot;/euro-2016-panini-stickers/&quot;&gt;panini stickers&lt;/a&gt;. As I mentioned in a previous post, I have used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stickerswapping.com&quot;&gt;the sticker swapping website&lt;/a&gt; to share my swaps with people all over the UK. I have sent swaps off to London, Bristol, Cornwall, Lancashire, Wales, and Gloucester. You’ll also be happy to know that I got my hands on an Aleksei Berezutski. Only 52 left to go!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Logitech K380 Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/logitech-k380-review"/>
   <updated>2016-06-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/logitech-k380-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time for a little gear review. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/multi-device-keyboard-k380&quot;&gt;Logitech K380 keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. It pairs with devices wirelessly over Bluetooth. I bought it to use with my Apple TV, iPad and iPhone. It runs on 2 AAA batteries, but the supplied batteries are not rechargeable. The keyboard is light and portable but you definitely know you have it in your bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s lovely to type on. For a go-anywhere keyboard it has a surprisingly nice feel to the keys. It also gives equal weight to Windows and Mac keys, so it’s quite easy to use across both platforms. The only frustration is that the iPad doesn’t support keyboards as it should and the iPhone is even worse. I’m expecting that to change in iOS 10, which is due to be announced at WWDC next week. Of course, none of this is the fault of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I said I use it with three devices. This is because it has three keys dedicated to switching between devices. This is really useful because you don’t have to remember how to faff around getting the keyboard to connect to each of your devices. This keyboard is pleasingly non-monogamous (in the Bluetooth sense) whereas the apple keyboard can be hard to shift from one device to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from its flexibility, what motivated me to buy a another keyboard to cart around with me? Well there was its natty grey and yellow colour scheme (an equally natty royal blue and turquoise version is also available) which makes me oddly happy. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/article/3041435/iphone-ipad/ulysses-for-iphone-review-anything-but-a-plain-text-editor.html&quot;&gt;More important is the recent appearance of Ulysses on my iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;/useful-ulysses/&quot;&gt;I’ve written about Ulysses before&lt;/a&gt;. I love it. It keeps getting better and better. It’s expensive but it’s worth it because it makes me love writing and it has made me better at writing too. Having it on my phone has been so useful that I thought a keyboard to spare my thumbs would be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the k380 is a well made, aesthetically pleasing, affordable and useful keyboard. Logitech haven’t paid me to say any of this but maybe they should! (There are no ads on this blog, just hearty endorsements!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Euro 2016 Panini Stickers</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/euro-2016-panini-stickers"/>
   <updated>2016-06-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/euro-2016-panini-stickers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sound the conspicuous consumption klaxon! 📣 I know it’s foolish but I decided to collect the Panini stickers for the Euro 2016 tournament this summer. I think it’s a more edifying waste of money than a series of group game accumulators that don’t come off. If this week’s long read in The Guardian is anything to go by, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/big-gamble-dangerous-british-betting-shops&quot;&gt;we really shouldn’t be giving any more of our money to betting companies&lt;/a&gt;. The album also looks better than any of the official books. Anyway, this post celebrates my inner collector/geek and the beauty of the shiny sticker!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find sticking the stickers into the album relaxing. Like the craze for adult colouring books, it takes a nostalgic childhood memory and uses it to escape the pressures of everyday life. I wouldn’t say that I’m a perfectionist though, I totally mangled Swedish keeper Andreas Isakson as I stuck him in and I’ve even stuck down an a-b pair in the wrong order!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burning question is how many packets of stickers will it take to fill the album? It depends on how many people you are able to swap with and how much money you are prepared to spend on excess stickers. If you have enough friends collecting stickers, you should in theory be able to buy 675 stickers (135 packets at 50p each) because you can then swap all your duplicates with your mates. eBay wasn’t a thing when I was ten (the last time I collected stickers for the 1990 World Cup) but it is now. You can resort to all sorts of shenanigans there. In the real world and such “cheating” aside, it’s likely that you will need more than 135 packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-hypergeometric-distribution-stickers-induced-bankruptcy-and-you&quot;&gt;The Hypergeometric distribution, stickers-induced bankruptcy and you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many swaps are you likely to generate? We can calculate the probability of getting N out of 5 new unseen stickers in each packet. We use hypergeometric distribution for just this sort of thing: taking small samples from a larger population without replacement and calculating the probability of N successes in that sample. In Excel the formula &lt;code&gt;=HYPERGEOM.DIST(NUM_GOT,5,NUM_NEED,TOTAL_NUM,0)&lt;/code&gt; generates these probabilities. The names I gave the variables should explain each parameter. As mentioned you get five stickers in each pack, so this is the number of draws each time. The fifth parameter takes the value 1 or 0 depending on whether you want cumulative values or not. Cumulative values helped me build the Markov chain I used later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we play around in Excel we see that the probability of generating swaps increases quickly as you begin to accumulate more stickers. In the following table I compare a situation near to the start of collecting, somewhere about halfway through, and somewhere near to the end:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of unseen stickers (Out of 5)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With 600 stickers still to collect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With 300 stickers still to collect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With 50 stickers still to collect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;53.4%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;1.6%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;35.8%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;10.5%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;9.5%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;26.9%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;0.3%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;1.2%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;34.1%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;4.3%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;0.1%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;21.5%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;27.2%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;5.4%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;68.2%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with most of the album still to fill, you have a just over 50% chance of putting all your new stickers into the album. Happily you also have a minuscule chance of getting five stickers that you already have. Once you get beyond the halfway point, you’re most likely to be adding between one and three new stickers to your album with each new packet - and you still have three hundred to go! It’s a good job that Panini allows you to send in a list for your final 50 stickers as by then you have a greater than 2 in 3 chance of not getting any new stickers in each packet! That is only one new sticker on average in every three packets! This is why having a large pool of friends to swap with is so important!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shiny-situation&quot;&gt;The shiny situation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this assumes that all the stickers are of equal rarity. You can understand why there might be more Gareth Bales or Anthony Martials about than there are Florin Andones or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/teams/player=1905362/index.html&quot;&gt;Taulant Xhakas&lt;/a&gt;, at least in the UK. It might help Panini to sell more stickers to casual collectors if you can track down the famous faces quickly. Nevertheless, I think that the table above goes a long way towards explaining the perceived rarity of stickers: the more you have, the rarer the ones you don’t have seem to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this, we can use the shiny stickers as an example. These are the Panini equivalent of finding Willy Wonka’s golden ticket. They make getting the Icelandic team badge the best thing to happen all week. I estimate that there are 50 shiny stickers in the album. There is one for each team badge and one for each team photo, and the pictures of the trophy at the start of the album are also shiny. We can again use the hypergeometric distribution to estimate the probability of getting one shiny sticker in your packet of five stickers. If you have no shiny stickers yet the chance is about 27% (and also 4.0% of the time you might get two in one packet: this has happened to me). However, if you already have ten shiny stickers the chance of getting another in your packet (that you don’t already have) drops to 22%. Particular stickers just seem rarer because it’s more difficult to find new stickers once you possess a certain number of stickers. Once you start looking for one sticker in particular, it will seem very rare indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simulations&quot;&gt;Simulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will finish with the results of a simulation. Using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain&quot;&gt;Markov chain&lt;/a&gt; with transition probabilities determined by the hypergeometric distribution, I simulate a single collector’s progress. I ran it a 1000 times until a cutoff of 50 stickers (when you can send your final list to Panini). This assumes that all stickers are equally rare and that the collector never makes any swaps. The graph below shows 25 of the 1000 runs and how the number of stickers remaining changes as the collector opens more packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/StickerGraph.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these conditions my collector has to buy an average of 355 packets over the 1000 runs. This means that on average they spend £184.50p to fill the album (including the £7 spent on buying 50 final stickers at 15p each from Panini). In 1000 runs, the minimum number of packets needed was 306 (for a total cost of £160) and the maximum number of packets needed was 418 (for a total cost of £216). The median was 354 packets and the interquartile range was 344 to 365 packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth thinking about this in terms of the price paid for each unique sticker. If you’re the lucky person who gets all the stickers inside 306 packets you’ll pay 24p per sticker. The unlucky person who has to buy 418 packets ends up paying a whopping 32p per sticker! If you don’t swap any stickers then on average you’ll end spending 27p per sticker. This is nearly three times their initial cost and almost twice the price per sticker that Panini charges for completing the final fifty of the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-save-money&quot;&gt;How to save money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to save money. The first is to find some friends to swap with. In theory this allows you to keep the cost of every sticker at 10p. If I have time, a follow-up post will explore what happens to a group of collectors who agree to exhange doubles after each batch of packets bought. I’d like to write a simulator that helps answer questions like “How many friends do you need?” and “What batch size between swap sessions is best?”. I’d also like to explore what happens when the assumption of equally rare stickers no longer holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your friends are too sensible to get in on this sticker collecting lark, the second thing you could do is persuade each friend to buy you fifty stickers direct from Panini. This is probably as effective as swapping (because swapping is unlikely to be 100% efficient) but you would miss the thrill of opening packets and the social interaction that comes with swapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve swapped with friends at work who are collecting and I have also taken to the internet to make swaps with strangers. So far I’ve added at least 100 stickers to my collection this way, with at least 40 (so far) arriving in the post from people I’ve never met. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stickerswapping.com/index.php&quot;&gt;stickerswapping.com&lt;/a&gt; website is useful both for organising your collection and for setting up trades with fellow collectors. It relies on your ability to trust strangers from the internet but people have little to gain from ripping you off. Nevertheless it’s a good idea not to accept trades that appear too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the sticker swapping site allows you to see how many people have a particular sticker to swap. Is one sticker rarer than the others? You bet. &lt;a href=&quot;http://thumbs.ebaystatic.com/images/g/gF8AAOSwVcFXO2c0/s-l140.jpg&quot;&gt;The shiny of the Belgian team badge!&lt;/a&gt; I’ll trade you three Romanian strikers if you have one going spare!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, May 2016</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-may-2016"/>
   <updated>2016-05-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-may-2016</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Album Digest May 2016 features the work of four bands or artists that I have reviewed in previous album digests. I also own (or will own) all of these albums on vinyl, so it’s handy that I’ve recently bought myself a record player!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool&quot;&gt;Radiohead “A Moon Shaped Pool”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radiohead released “A Moon Shaped Pool” online about three weeks ago and a physical version hits the shops later in June. As with all of their recent albums, it is (mostly) a slow burner that rewards multiple listens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the space of two days they released the ‘single’ and most immediate song “Burn The Witch”, and also a more abstract song called “Daydreamer”. These turned out to be the opening two tracks. They released the album with no fanfare and people only knew it was called “A Moon Shaped Pool” about an hour before its official release. This happened when Google Music listed it early by mistake. People assumed that the track listing revealed at the same time was incorrect because it was in alphabetical order, but this later turned out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Burn The Witch” is the catchiest song Radiohead have released in years: with imposing strings and a sneering vocal it storms by in no time. “Daydreaming” is more of a muddle with murmured lyrics drifting through gentle ambiance until about five minutes in when the strings kick in and take hold. The last twenty seconds always convince me that a gremlin is in my speaker with weird backward vocals and rumbles closing the track. Very spooky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Decks Dark” is my favourite song on the album. It is the song that sounds most like a typical Radiohead song and while for most bands this would seem dull but when Radiohead pull all their intriguing elements together it is a delight. The last example of this that I can think of is “All I Need”, which also pulls together their outsider mentality and a beautiful musical arrangement. The next song “Desert Island Disk” does this too, and if you’ve ever wanted to hear folky finger picking on a Radiohead record, then this is your moment. In times gone by this is the song they would have cut in to little pieces and played backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point it is clear that “A Moon Shaped Pool” is less abrasive than previous albums. Even though a full-on guitar riff is unleashed at the end of “Ful Stop”, the song sounds like a calmer cousin of “The National Anthem”. It also has a wonderful middle section that sounds nothing like “The National Anthem”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the theme of album emerges too, it is (mostly) a break-up album. (“Burn The Witch” isn’t about a break-up and its title would be unfortunate if it were.) I don’t like break-up albums. They’re often used by (male) artists to claim they were wronged in relationships they failed to contribute to. But while it is downcast and sad, “A Moon Shaped Pool” avoids self-pity. Break-ups happen: it’s horrible but they do. This album explores the realities and surrealities of it. “Glass Eyes” is sweet and sad, let down by not allowing the gorgeous string arrangement to extend far beyond its alloted thirty seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Identikit” strikes me as funny. It’s about wanting to chide a partner for their part in the end of a relationship, but it also evolves into something self-aware and silly. It almost satirises the typical break-up song. The chorus of “broken hearts make it rain” is beautiful and ludicrous at the same time. It also displays an attention to vocal detail that Radiohead often gloss over. Thom’s vocals are always an asset to the band, but here the arrangement of the backing vocals also shines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ecological theme of “The Numbers” (which began life named for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring&quot;&gt;Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring”&lt;/a&gt;) speaks to a need for personal change. It too has interesting vocal arrangements and wonderful string arrangements. For me this is the first Radiohead album where you can sit and notice the quality of the musicianship without it being mucked about with and obfuscated. That’s not fair, “In Rainbows” also found them dispatching songs with consummate skill, which is why many people (not me!) felt that “King of Limbs” was a slight backward step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Present Tense” is another great song and I love it almost as much as “Decks Dark”. It has a great lyric about grace under pressure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Distance / Is like a weapon / Of self defence / Against the The present tense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penultimate song “Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggarman Thief” is still growing on me, though it’s another track with a fantastic string arrangement. It leads nicely into “True Love Waits”. As with “In Rainbows”, which revisited the old favourite “Nude”, they release a definitive studio recording of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1044-19-unreleased-radiohead-songs-that-could-be-on-their-next-album/&quot;&gt;one of their oldest ‘missing’ songs&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a beautiful rendition and better than the live version at the end of the “I Might Be Wrong” mini album. I’m surprised at just how &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; it sounds even after twenty-two years. I think it’s because the song had something timeless about it all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised by just how much I like this album. It’s already one of my favourite Radiohead albums. Having recently bought a record player, I’m looking forward to listening to it alongside my existing vinyl copies of “In Rainbows” and “The King of Limbs”. I will write an update and review the bonus songs later on in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mark-pritchard-under-the-sun&quot;&gt;Mark Pritchard “Under The Sun”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about Mark Pritchard’s collaboration with Steve Spacek as Africa Hitech five years ago in the &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-may-2011/&quot;&gt;May 2011 Album Digest&lt;/a&gt;. That album, “93 Million Miles” was more of an old school dance affair, while “Under The Sun” roves far and wide for inspiration. Mostly electronic, it nevertheless reaches out into pop, rock, and folk music, among others. While albums can suffer when they genre-hop in this way, “Under the Sun” keeps things under control by not making massive leaps. The pace and tone change frequently but not in such a dramatic way that you want to stop listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”?” emerges slowly and surely out of the silence over six minutes. “Give It Your Choir” is a collaboration with Bibio that delivers a chilled pop moment. The ideas Pritchard explores in his interludes are interesting. “Infrared” sounds like Neu! and “Falling” has a pleasant 8bit feel to it, like a SNES game soundtracked by Aphex Twin. “Beautiful People” links back to the Radiohead album as it features a guest vocal from Thom Yorke. It also has a wicked catchy flute riff. I bet there are awesome remixes of this track, or that there soon will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album continues in this vein. “Where Do They Go, The Butterflies?” and “Sad Alron” have a Boards of Canada feel, even if they don’t quite match BoC’s otherworldliness. “You Wash My Soul” (with Linda Perhacs) takes us into full folk territory. There’s a wonderful spooky vocal performance and finger-picked guitar, while the synths are subtle enough you wonder if they’re even there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cycles of 9” has a modern classical feel with a minimalist repeating riff and a lush string arrangement. It feels a lot like Max Richter’s reworking of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. “Hi Red” is a funny interlude and helps to reintroduce the electronics. The next track “Ems” is my favourite. It’s another slow building instrumental with a strong minimalist “riff”. It reminds of some of the experiments by Laurie Spiegel included on the compilation-cum-reissue of &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-june-2014/&quot;&gt;“The Expanding Universe”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spoken word collaboration with Beans called “The Blinds” is interesting. It sounds like a modern version of Tom Waits’ “9th and Hennepin”. The backing track is an insistent pulse over which weird Kraftwerkian noises intrude. I’m ambivalent about the vocal as I’m not convinced by the poetry and so I’d love to hear just the instrumental version. “Dawn of the North” and “Khufu” both sound like late-period tracks by The Orb, all ripples and no real intent beyond creating a bit of atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At just three minutes “Rebel Angels” is one track that could probably do with being a touch longer. It’s a hyperactive track that adds a little bit of intensity to a rather slow second half, though it too dissolves into agreeable ambience for the last minute of its runtime. This leads into the title track, which is a midtempo song built around a sample: “For every evil under the sun / There is a remedy”. It’s an exercise in repetition as the sun slowly ebbs and flows before fading away. Overall it’s a pleasant and chilled-out album, ambient without being too sleepy and beaty without being too sweaty. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brian-eno-the-ship&quot;&gt;Brian Eno “The Ship”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This review of Brian Eno’s excellent new album will be short. There are only four tracks, though the title track does consume half the running time (and two sides of the double vinyl version).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I reviewed an Eno album, it was &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-august-2014/&quot;&gt;his collaborations with Underworld’s Karl Hyde&lt;/a&gt;. In July 2011 he released &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-july-2011/&quot;&gt;“Drums Between The Bells”&lt;/a&gt;, an album that set the poetry of Rick Holland to music, and after that in November 2012 he released &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-november-2012/&quot;&gt;“LUX”&lt;/a&gt;, a set of longform instrumentals for an exhibition in an art gallery. This album mixes elements of all three of these recent projects, leaning more heavily on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title track is 21 minutes long. It begins with a noise collage before evolving into a fairly literal song about a ship. It’s much more compelling than that description makes it sound and most of the joy of it comes in the second where the whole track collapses into noise. The melodies fragment into drones and the vocals get smushed into their component vibrations. Barely audibile spoken word segments and siren calls surface and sink as the track progresses. There are also spatial experiments during the more abstract moments where drones, pulses and other sound elements move around the stereo field. I can’t offer much critique because it’s such a long piece to consider in its entirety but I can say that I’ve always enjoyed it. (Though I must say that I also fall asleep to it regularly because it is very relaxing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the album is called “Fickle Sun” and is split into three parts. The first part (18 minutes long) is similar to “The Ship”, while part two (“The Hour is Thin”) is a poem created by a Markov Chain read by Peter Serafinowiz and part three is a pretty straight cover of “I’m Set Free” by the Velvet Underground. This is a long form piece that asks the listener to consider component parts in isolation, compared to how “The Ship” throws every component at you almost at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fickle Sun” follows a similar format to “The Ship”: what begins as an interesting song about toil and labour becomes deconstructed as the minutes pass. Rather than capturing an impressionistic scene of a ship on the waves, we get interludes of industrial noise and folky work songs. By about twelve minutes in the lyrics are whispered and the melodies are sparse and ambient. As with “The Ship” spoken word elements are whispered over one another and lyrical elements are stretched out, sped up and overlaid. It’s disorienting and yet always interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Hour is Thin” is strange and funny, especially once you know that it was written by a random process. Peter Serafinowiz manages to read it pretty straight and the piece sounds a lot like those on “Drums Between the Bells”. It’s a shame that there isn’t more information on the sleeve about how the words were created because without it, the track seems not to have any context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover of “I’m Set Free” is excellent. I haven’t heard much of Eno’s singing before but there is plenty on this album. There’s no mucking about: it’s a beautiful rendition of a great song, albeit one that I’d not heard of before. I wonder if it’s a tribute to David Bowie or perhaps even to Lou Reed. Either way, it’s a great way to close out an interesting album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parquet-courts-human-performance&quot;&gt;Parquet Courts “Human Performance”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-june-2014/&quot;&gt;“Sunbathing Animal” was one of my favourite albums of 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It was a shouty punky affair that made the pain of looking for a job almost bearable. Peppered with intellect and humour, which is also the case on “Human Performance” which is their latest ‘proper’ album. “Human Performance” came out in March, but back then I wasn’t sure if I would write another album digest. By April I had so many albums to write about, I realised I needed to wait to do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say it’s their first ‘proper’ since “Sunbathing Animal” but they released two mini albums in between. I reviewed “Content Nausea” in my January 2015 album digest, but I found the more recent and experimental “Monastic Living EP” difficult to listen to. And when I say difficult to listen to, I mean ‘tunes’ that flirt with the boundary between noise and music. Some experiments, no matter how necessary, should be confined to the laboratory. That said, something about those weird wonky instrumentals filters through into “Human Performance”, an album that appears to delve deeper into the thoughts and feelings of its creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I bought a vinyl copy of this album, and I’m glad I did. There’s a booklet glued into the gatefold with cool artwork and the lyrics set down in a handwritten font. I loved the old school experience of sitting down next to the record player watching the record spin on the turntable with the lyrics spread out over my lap. Not just because it’s a great album to sit and listen to, but also - like the best albums - it’s a great album to get up and dance to as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite songs are “Dust”, “Human Performance”, “Berlin Got Blurry”, and “Keep It Even”. “Dust” continues in the vein of the singles from “Sunbathing Animal” and is simply about dust being everywhere. I do love the interesting pedal work and car horns at the end. The title track seems to be about depression, though it could just as well be about lost love. It has an efficient music arrangement and I love how the bass guitar wanders through the song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the lyrics to “Berlin Got Blurry”, they pack out the lyric booklet and tell the story of a mad weekend in Berlin. Better still is the surf guitar riff that kicks off each verse and the busy bass line that propels it along. The lyrics are also what draw me to “Keep It Even”, though much of my love for this song also stems from the guitar lines supplied by Jeff Tweedy. They sound like they’re straight off &lt;a href=&quot;/uc-27-a-ghost-is-born-wilco/&quot;&gt;“A Ghost Is Born”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parquet Courts also wear their influences well on this album too. The guitar solo at the end of “One Man No City” sounds like Rain by The Beatles. “Paraphrased” captures the sound of Pixies to my ears, not just in the shouty vocals and quiet/loud dynamics but also in the angular guitars and the production. The delivery of stream of consciousness lyrics on “Captive of the Sun” sound like it could have come off Beck’s “Odelay”. “Steady On My Mind” channels Lou Reed in convincing fashion, and not for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three songs aren’t so successful. “Two Dead Cops” is shouty and not in a good way. The lyric, which is one of the wordiest in the booklet, is barely discernible. I guess I’ll have to listen it again and pay more attention. “Pathos Prairie” attempts to emulate The Clash but I don’t think it really works. On the last song “It’s Gonna Happen” the band experiment with a slow burner, and it’s okay but it just doesn’t appeal to me. Imagine “Good Night” from “The Beatles” performed by the Velvet Underground: the idea is awesome but the execution isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parquet Courts continue to experiment and improve. They write songs that interest me both with their lyrics and with their musical arrangements. Listening to their albums gives me great pleasure and I hope they’ll end up like Wilco or Radiohead and churn out an interesting album every few years.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2016 marks the centenary of the birth of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;amp;VF=MAGO31_9_VForm&amp;amp;ERID=24KL534M5N&quot;&gt;Werner Bischof&lt;/a&gt;, the talented Magnum photojournalist who died in Peru in 1954, aged 38. He travelled widely, making the most of an incredible talent for photography. After the second world war, this led him all over Europe to document its aftermath. As the cold war began, Bischof found himself documenting events further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw two exhibitions of his photography at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elysee.ch&quot;&gt;Musée de l’Elysée in Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;. “Point of View” explores his international work spanning the years 1945 to 1954. “Helvetica” explores his earlier work while isolated from travel in Switzerland during the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;point-of-view&quot;&gt;Point of View&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Point of View” is a retrospective of his Magnum work. It works backward from photos that he took in Peru in the weeks before his road accident, with rooms divided into continents. 1953-54 features photos from the Americas, 1953-1950 photos from Asia, and 1945-1950 photos from Europe. In each room there is either rarely seen or previously unseen work. This includes a large slideshow of unpublished pictures from North and South America, a documentary about his first photography exhibition in Zurich featuring photos from India and Japan, and in the European room a large number of contact sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact sheets are a direct print made from a roll or sequence of images of film. Before digital photography they were an important part of the photographer’s art as it enabled potential clients to quickly look through and select their best work. A lot of the European contact sheets were clearly used to sell pictures to different photo journals as some photos often appeared on more than one contact sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;helvetica&quot;&gt;Helvetica&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helvetica is a collection of photos, photograms and contact sheets from the time Bischof spent in Switzerland as a young photographer. This exhibition was the first chance to see many of these pieces. It was a small collection, which was understandable, but the presentation was rather disappointing. It was contained wholly within the European section of the Point of View show and seemed quite banal in contrast to the post-war material. On further reflection I think the Helvetica pieces were very interesting but at the time the poor staging at the Elysée undermined this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-note-on-photography-exhibitions-some-photos&quot;&gt;A note on photography exhibitions. Some photos.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be odd for me to say this given how these exhibitions were the main reason we went to Switzerland when we did but I don’t think it is as important to see photos in the flesh as it is to see painting or sculpture. When you see paintings up close you can see the brushstrokes and other evidence of artistry. It is possible to reproduce a large extent of the artistry involved in a great photo in a book. However, it was a pleasant experience to see all the photos together in a gallery setting rather than peering at them in a tabletop book. What we gained in Lausanne was the context for the work and a chance to linger long over each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I include a few of Bischof’s photographs that I was able to find (of sufficient quality) online. However, I can’t say with certainty that these digital reproductions are as good as seeing the real thing. There is something about properly developed photos and no matter how good a screen you have there will always be imperfections in the way that screen reproduces a photograph. Go see an exhibition or failing that, find a book. His work is shown a lot and there are also numerous books, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.phaidon.com/store/photography/werner-bischof-9780714840413/&quot;&gt;his excellent entry&lt;/a&gt; in the Phaidon 55 &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.phaidon.com/store/photography/phaidon-55/&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I think it is important to include some of the photographs we saw. This is because these photographs and their artistry are important. Not only because of what they describe, but also how they are constructed. To discuss this (even in my cack-handed way) it is necessary to include some of them with this post. I guess this is a long-winded way of claiming fair use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1941-nude-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/lausanne-exhibition-cover-breast-with-grid-1941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second world war prevented Bischof from taking up a photography degree in Paris. He whiled away the war years with advertorial work and abstract photographic experiments. One example is this nude, which uses light to create markings and shapes over the body of the subject. Other studies in this period include mountains, plants, photograms, and more work involving models. Another nude adorns the leaflets advertising the show we saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is telling that Helvetica is the least interesting part of the show. This could be because the exhibition sequences the photos in reverse chronological order. I believe this was a mistake. It denies viewers the opportunity to see how the abstract work fed into his later photojournalism. Because of this, I’ve presented this selection of photos in chronological order (as best I can).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1946-The-Reichstag-Berlin-Germany-Werner-Bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1947-red-cross-train-budapest-hungary-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1947-Puszta-Inn-Hungary-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bischof’s travels around Europe between 1946 and 1950 gave him the opportunity take photographs that tell powerful stories. Those stories are rooted in the tragic impact of the second world war throughout the whole of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photograph of the boys sweeping up in the chateau repurposed as a grain store captured my imagination. What do the boys think of the grandiose room they are sweeping up in? What is more valuable to them? The chandelier or the grain? What have those boys seen in the war? What does the future hold for them? A single photograph can introduce so many stories and ask so many questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clever picture of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berlin.de/en/attractions-and-sights/3560965-3104052-reichstag.en.html&quot;&gt;Reichstag&lt;/a&gt; juxtaposes the building’s bombed out domed roof with an abandoned bullet-ridden helmet. It compares and contrasts the impact of the war on soldiers and the cities they are fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photographs from Hungary show the far-reaching spread of the privations of war and its aftermath. The children are on a Red Cross respite train, these were laid on to help children recover in rural areas from the stresses of war. You can see how uncertainty about the future haunts the gaze of these children as they stare from the windows. It captures the potential for war’s traumas to echo down through generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often think of adults as more resilient but there’s a strong sense of vulnerability about the elder gentlemen in his photograph taken in the inn. There’s a sense that the group is huddling together to exclude the outside world and the gaze of the photographer, taking refuge in the time honoured tradition of boozing together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1951-Children-running-toward-trucks-delivering-food-to-famine-stricken-village-bahar-india-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1951-in-front-of-the-steelworks-jamshedpur-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1952-dancer-japan-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photographs from India are wonderful. They’re not necessarily of wonderful things, but they are amazing photographs. The light completely changes as you might expect in a different part of the world. The stories remain however, and what stories they are. The first of the two that I managed to find online echoes the grain silo picture: is the seeming glee on the children’s faces due to the arrival of the grain truck or simply the joy of running? You can look across the children and see the whole gamut between these extremes. There is the same mixture of uncertainty and curiosity in the faces as those that peered out of the window of Hungarian Red Cross train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photograph of the women walking in front of the steelworks brings out another theme in Bischof’s work, that of the collision between tradition and modernity. We can say the same about the picture of the Japanese dancers (1952). Here the juxtaposition of old and new manifests in small details - the calendar with western numerals and the women’s makeup, more suggestive of showgirls than geishas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine how striking these photographs were in the 1950s. While the world was smaller than it had ever been, to many people it was still huge and unfamiliar. Pictures from India and Japan may as well have been of another planet. Even after the war, the world was still fraught with dangers. Despite post-war regeneration, there were still threats of disease, famine and of future wars with an added nuclear dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1952-in-the-garden-of-the-meiji-temple-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1953-farmer-cambodia-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photograph Bischof took in the garden of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gojapango.com/tokyo/meiji_shrine.htm&quot;&gt;Meiji temple&lt;/a&gt; is one of his most famous and with good reason. There is something serene about its composition and how it captures the beauty of this setting. Even today it feels almost like an archetypal image of Japanese culture. There’s no overt juxtaposition of themes or storytelling aspect, it’s just a moment of beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same could be said for the photograph of the junks in Hong Kong harbour. Bischof excludes all modernity from the frame, capturing the serenity of seeing these traditional boats at sail. There’s no more to it than that. Sometimes a great picture is just a great picture. (Even though this digital version is cropped and looks better in person.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time even Bischof’s more political and journalistic photographs were masterful compositions. He skewers the absurdity of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War&quot;&gt;Korean prisoner of war camp&lt;/a&gt;. Grown men kept prisoner in their homeland trapped by ideology and drying their washing on the barbed wire. The image of the Cambodian farmer with the parasol is also a delight. I like how he seems to have more of a hold on his beautiful parasol than either of his cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1953-Painting-the-golden-gate-bridge-werner-bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bischof visited the USA in 1953. The pictures he took include the only colour photographs in the exhibition. In many of these Bischof takes an outsider perspective. His camera looks down on parking lots from high skyscrapers and scopes out unusual sights. Cars parked on rooftops forming patterns. Rears of cars poking out of the windows of a strange garage. A man doused in orange paint coming down from the Golden Gate Bridge. Each captures an unusual moment, one that you might never have thought about until seeing the photograph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition featured many photographs from this period in which Bischof continued to explore the tension between new technology and old beliefs. One of my favourites, which I have not found online, was of a pair of nuns standing next to an automatic ticket machine in a bus station. The nuns laugh together and a sign indicates that the ticket machine is closed.  It might not sound like much but for me it articulated a crossing point between our old community ways (often enforced by religion) and the more remote modern life with fewer interpersonal reactions. That Bischof selected the precise moment that provokes these thoughts in me over sixty years later speaks to his ability as a photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bischof/1954-People-near-Machu-Picchu-Werner-Bischof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/south-america-trip-part-9/&quot;&gt;I visited Peru and Machu Picchu almost sixty years after Werner Bischof&lt;/a&gt;. Hiram Bingham “rediscovered” Machu Picchu in 1911 and it was not until the seventies that the Peruvian government encouraged tourism to the area. So when Bischof visited in 1954, the site was not the tourist trap it is today. The pictures he took of Machu Picchu and the surrounding villages were as much of new and exciting places as those he took in India and the far east a few years earlier. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu&quot;&gt;In fact the photo of the site on Wikipedia is Werner Bischof’s picture&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed comparing his pictures to my own - his are way better! (And he’d hiked there along a far less developed version of the Inca trail!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t look at the photographs from Peru without feeling some sadness. They were his last. Bischof and his travel companions had pressed on with their journey despite having trouble with their vehicle. It was holy week - there are lots of photos of the pilgrims - and they were unable to find a mechanic to fix the the vehicle. A few days later Bischof died with two other passengers when their car fell off a cliff on a mountain road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tragic event robbed the world of a great photographer. These exhibitions show that Werner Bischof left a body of work to celebrate and it is sad that we did not get to see more. His work prompted my interest in how the second world war became the cold war. Even now it shows how we as a world are all interconnected and that every small story has a part to play in the wider whole.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Paul McAuley, Something Coming Through</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/something-coming-through-by-paul-mcauley"/>
   <updated>2016-05-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/something-coming-through-by-paul-mcauley</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Something Coming Through” is a science fiction novel set in the near future. A few years after a brief nuclear war known as “The Spasm”, an alien race known as the Jackaroo introduce themselves to humanity. The novel is funny, thoughtful, and politically charged. I found it to be a good read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aliens have given humanity fifteen “gift” worlds and an automated way to access them. Think of the Docklands Light Railway but with space shuttles. These worlds contain artefacts and remnants from their previous occupants. Movement between the worlds has also changed the Earth: it suffers from incursions by invasive species brought back from the other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action in the novel takes place in two strands. One strand starts on Earth. Chloe, an anthropologist working for an innovation company called Disruption Theory, tracks an “outbreak” of a cult caused by bizarre alien technology. Meanwhile the other strand takes place on Mangala, one of the gift worlds. A policeman named Vic investigates the murder of someone just arrived from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enigmatic Jackaroo seem a little too cool for school. Could it be that they aren’t entirely in control of events? Or that they aren’t who they seem to be? Not everyone welcomes their presence and this complicates Chloe’s mission. Part of the action takes place in a parliamentary hearing, with a UKIP-style politician attempts to grill a Jackaroo (the understatedly named Bob Smith) about their intentions. It feels like an unashamedly British take on sci-fi, reminiscent of the old classics by the likes of HG Wells and Arthur C. Clarke - but with nuances of more modern sci-fi by writers like William Gibson also mixed in. (Speaking of William Gibson, I really must finish “The Peripheral” one day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the sections on the alien world fuse hard-boiled police drama and hard SF, exploring the way that we would no doubt bring our earthbound dramas and foibles to any new paradise given to us. Science Fiction commonly uses the private eye. Nerds love genre mashups, but also the private eye provides an interesting viewpoint for the reader. The author can use the hypervigilance of the character to introduce readers to the strange new world. Personally I preferred the sections with Chloe, as I felt she was the more interesting and less stereotypical protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the two stories converge and the novel runs out of steam a bit when this happens. That said, I thought the lag of one story behind the other in time made for interesting shifts in perspective. A sequel already exists - called “Into Everywhere” - and a lot of “Something Coming Through” builds up the world and sets the scene. While the culmination of “Something Coming Through” gets rushed, it does feel like it sets things up nicely for the sequels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My paperback includes the first chapter of “Into Everywhere”. I thought it was great and better written than most of “Something Coming Through”. It felt more assured, perhaps by establishing the world in “Something Coming Through” McAuley will write something mind-blowing for the follow-on. With some interesting characters and settings left open in the first book, it will be interesting to see where the series goes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, April 2016</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-april-2016"/>
   <updated>2016-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-april-2016</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month’s album digest is a mixture of comparisons. First we compare the fortunes of old hands Underworld to even older hands the Pet Shop Boys. After that I’ve found two dance albums, one that I liked and one that I didn’t. I find it quite hard to write about dance music and so the comparison is quite useful. Sometimes it helps to work out why you like one thing and not another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pet-shop-boys-super&quot;&gt;Pet Shop Boys “Super”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month’s pop album is “Super” by the Pet Shop Boys. For some it will be a surprise that they are still going but they did spark back to life somewhat with their last release “Electric”. This album, by following in the same vein of melding their usual pop sensibilities to ‘up to date’ electronic music, does not have the novelty value of “Electric” but it is another strong showing nonetheless. This time there aren’t as many big pop songs (there are no equivalents here to “Bolshy”, “Love is a Bourgeois Construct” or “Thursday”) but instead a sense of invention. If “Electric” was the monster, “Super” turns out to be the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the experiments are more successful than others. “The Pop Kids” details exactly how the Pet Shop Boys (and most of their fans) have felt for decades about pop music and its power to liberate people from the banality of their everyday lives. It does so in ebullient fashion. “Happiness” misspells its titular emotion for wry comic effect, tittering with tongue in cheek. “Twenty Something” ambles along on a loping beat and sympathetically follows the titular twenty-something through his or her day. It manages to wryly observe the dull minutiae of modern life, just as “West End Girls” did back in the day. I also really like “Pazzo!”, a fizzing and fissile instrumental just about held together by sampled vocal snippets. It’s short and to the point, like a leaner meaner version of “Axis” from “Electric”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other experiments are less successful. “The Dictator Decides” attempts to give us Kim Jong Un’s interior monologue as a weepy show tune and it only partially succeeds. It’s more wishful thinking than insightful geopolitical analysis. “Sad Robot World” isn’t as funny as it would like to be and is undermined by Neil Tennant pitching his voice way too high. In my opinion, very few PSB songs benefit when he sings in this way. “Undertow” has a great chorus but is underdeveloped compared to “Pop Kids” and “Twenty Something”. The same can also be said of “Inner Sanctum”: it’s a belter of a tune but the lyric is so underdeveloped they needn’t have bothered. While “Pazzo!” also gets by with a minimal lyrics, I guess the repetition of this makes the album feel weaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame that “Twenty Something” and “The Pop Kids” are the only songs that recapture the observational skill that marked their heyday, but it’s nice to see that there’s still life and experimentation in them. Perhaps the conclusion to the “trilogy” will have more to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;underworld-barbara-barbara-we-face-a-shining-future&quot;&gt;Underworld “Barbara Barbara, We Face A Shining Future”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Barbara Barbara, We Face A Shining Future” is Underworld’s eighth album (in the current incarnation that assumes that “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” was their first) and their creativity shows no sign of abating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening trio of the single “I exhale”, “If Rah”, and “Low Burn” is probably the best Underworld 1-2-3 since “Beaucoup Fish”. “I Exhale” has a playful “blah blah blah” chorus and sing-song-spoken verses. “If Rah” comes from a long tradition of Underworld songs that use cut-up vocals (some might say fridge poetry) to present a strange story from multiple points of view. I think it might be about a literal fly on the wall trying to work out the habits of the silly humans he can see. “Low Burn” borrows more than just the word “burn” from “Beautiful Burnout” and is all the more wonderful for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Santiago Cuatro” is the first time that they break from their new template. It’s a moody instrumental piece dominated by acoustic guitar and electronic atmospherics. One of the drawbacks of listening to music through streaming services rather than by owning it is that you can’t see the sleeve notes. I have no idea if Karl or Rick played the guitar, or if it’s a guest, or a sample. Perhaps it’s better to just to sit back and listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Motorhome” reminds me of the collaborations between Chemical Brothers and Beth Orton on the Chems’ first couple of albums. It’s chilled out and has a slow folky vibe but in the background the electronics noodle away. I’d say that it’s one of their more successful attempts to meld live instrumentation with electronics. I tend to be agnostic about Karl’s more song-like creations, for every “Sola Sistim” we end up with a “Ring Road” now and then, but “Motor Home” isn’t too bad and fits in well with the surrounding tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album closes with a beautiful double-header that returns to the territory of “Low Burn”. First “Ova Nova” pulses while Karl softly croons a song of love and redemption over the top. It’s the first time that Karl really sings on the album and it’s a transcendent moment precisely because it’s been stowed away to this point. The end chorus of “every diamond” is yet another one of the many joyous nerve tingling moments their music has given us over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes “Nylon Strung”, in which Underworld finally master the art of closing an album in an upbeat way. Looking back through their work, most of their closing tracks have either been sad (“Louisiana” off “Barking”, “Stagger” off “Second Toughest in the Infants”) or weird and unsatisfactory (“M.E.” off “Dubnobasswithmyheadman”, “Stagger” off “Beaucoup Fish”, “Ess Gee” off “A Hundred Days Off”). But “Nylon Strung” is just beautiful - a slow steady pulse with sweet love struck vocals swooping back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of Underworld’s earlier music was couched in the alienation and loneliness of modern life, and how seeking refuge from that just leads you to ever more alienated and lonely places. Now they’ve settled nicely into a comfortable groove that allows them to demonstrate that things do get better. They show that if you are brave enough to keep inventing and exploring, eventually you find the place you belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;charlie-dont-surf-storms-ahead&quot;&gt;Charlie Don’t Surf “Storms Ahead”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, I think Charlie Don’t Surf is an awful pseudonym to perform under. Especially on Spotify, which doesn’t include the apostrophe and therefore makes my inner grammar disciplinarian twitch unnecessarily. There’s just something innately odd about appropriating a line from a classic film in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered this album via a playlist on Spotify called “Electronic concentration”. It’s full of rather soporific mid-tempo dance music and is designed for when you need a dull thud to drive you along as you do something you don’t really want to do. Like writing essays. In that playlist was the “Einmusic Remix” of this album’s title track “Storms Ahead”. The album itself was released the very week that I’d discovered the playlist, so I decided to give it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of good ideas on the album but they’re often drawn out and repeated too much. One of his favourite tricks is to build a track around a mall vocal snippet that expands gradually after many repetitions. It’s a fine trick at first but it begins to grate when the majority of the tracks use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album is a curious blend of what one might call “wine bar dance music” and the harder beats that peppered the second Leftfield album. It’s a fairly toothless combination in the end and the album sounds a lot like the playlist that led me to it in the first place: a dull thud to drive you along while you do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leon-vynehall-rojus&quot;&gt;Leon Vynehall “Rojus”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Charlie Don’t Surf, Leon Vynehall’s “Rojus” is a joyous and innovative dance album. It is also repetitive at times but the sounds evolve in layers and rely much less on brute force beats. Every time I listen to it the whole thing just flies by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds a lot like the Oxia album that I reviewed almost four years ago. I struggled to say a lot about that album too, I only know that it feels a lot more relaxed and less macho than the Charlie Don’t Surf one. For examples of why, check out “Saxony” which has a languid and funky beat - you can dance to it but it is also relaxing. “Beau Sovreign” is initially a breathy track that builds through repetitive vocal samples into a sleek house track. “Paradisea” is where I began to make the connection to Oxia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album culminates in a glorious eight minute track called “Blush” that has a sense of movement that is missing from almost the entirety of “Storms Ahead”. It reminds me of a massive pop-dance crossover hit from the mid-90s but for the life of me I can’t remember what it is. I will update when I remember what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-month&quot;&gt;Next Month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the album digest is back! Next month I’ll write about “The Ship” by Brian Eno, “Human Performance” by Parquet Courts, and, with any luck, a brand spanking new album by Radiohead if recent rumblings are anything to go by.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just before Easter Ingrid and I went to Lausanne in Switzerland for a few days. It was a much-needed break and my first trip out of the UK since I got back from South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caught an early train to Gatwick. It took a strange route along the coast via Worthing and Hove, which was annoying because we could have left later if a more direct train were available at that time of day. At least it wasn't late, which for Southern is really rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bleary-eyed we got the monorail to the North terminal and fumbled our way through customs. As usual I forgot to take off my belt. We had a reasonable breakfast and people-watched as young men ordered cocktails at 7am in the morning: makes you proud to be British.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight to Geneva was serene, extended a little by a strike by French air traffic control that meant we had to fly over Germany instead. The alpine scenery below us was beautiful, I love landing in new places on sunny days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough we were flashing our passports at yawn-stifling guys and walking through arrivals to the train platform. We could have bought our tickets from the machine but (in what would become a theme for the week) we were incredulous of the prices. Soon enough (11.03 English time, we'd left my flat at 4.45) we were out into the sunshine and peering out Lake Geneva in the hazy sunshine. Our bottle of mineral water cost about £4.50. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hotel was easy to find, about 15 minutes from the station. After checking in, we had a little rest and then went out again to explore Lausanne. Much warmer than we'd anticipated and sunny, it was perfect exploring weather. Lausanne tumbles down from the hills to the shore of lake Geneva, bracing itself with bridges on the way down. Views stack on top of more views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it through most of the shops up to the cathedral and a château nearby undergoing renovation. The cathedral is as impressive as all cathedrals in major cities, perhaps distinguished by some especially colourful stained glass windows and a beautiful side chapel with windows on all three protruding sides. When we were there it let in the late afternoon sun, making the statues shine. Around the cathedral there's a quiet arty district of narrow streets lined with architecture practices, web design studios and antique book stores, and supporting a restful stillness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the cathedral we stumbled down steep steps and people-watch some more. It's always fun to be on holiday and watch strangers in a strange town as they go about their business unaware that anyone observes them. However, we tired of shops (encountering the third Starbucks of the day generated a particular frustration and ennui) and rode the crammed metro a few stops to get closer to the lake. We found somewhere to eat dinner but to fill the hour and a half before the place opened we walked down to the shore and took in some more of Lausanne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly found the marina (and the hotel where we'd have dinner the following night) and snapped pictures of boats in the evening sun - in part a response to an ongoing request from Ingrid's mum. All sorts of sculptures line the shore and it's fun to snap them. Teenagers hung out with bluetooth speakers and skateboards, reminding me of Montevideo. Meanwhile, observing that inland they replace seagulls, we watched crows sit atop a play area squawking: the definitive sound of a murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a reasonable Italian meal and walk back to the hotel. Shattered, we realise that the hotel room's TV and the hour's time difference allow us to tune in for our usual Monday fix of University Challenge. The comforts of home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiredness ensures we sleep in on Tuesday morning. We walk to the Musee de Lycee for the Werner Bischof photography exhibition. I will write a separate post about it later. Afterwards we walk in the grounds of the museum and soon realise we've wandered into the grounds of the neighbouring Olympic museum. We decide to check out the café for lunch and it turns out to provide good food that Ingrid can eat. It's also good value, at least for Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat taken by the olympic museum, we decide that Tuesday has become museum day and stay on to visit the whole thing. It’s as hagiographic as you might expect it to be, but it's still fun. It demonstrates how much the olympic games involves itself into far more than just sport, though there probably could be more sporting footage throughout. The most interesting bit was to walk around the artefacts from previous games. It spoke to how the technology that supports athletes has changed over the hundred-or-so years of the modern games. I was particularly enamoured of the old school Swiss bob-sled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving the museum on the end of closing time, we walked down to the shore (via the Olympic flame) and this time headed east until we came across the Thai Pavillion. Then we turned west for dinner and had a lovely meal in the hotel we'd discovered the day before. I had a delicious chicken and white asparagus risotto, while Ingrid had a handsome lamb salad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the hotel we decided to look at the tourist guides we were given on arrival and work out what we hadn't seen for our last full day. We also had cards giving us free public transport that we had not yet used, so we figured we could at least get on a bus at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we had breakfast at the hotel and acquired a packed lunch from the assorted offerings. We walked westward along the shore of the lake to the neighbouring village of Saint-Sulpice, taking in the roman ruins on the way. After three hours we tired and walked to a bus stop, catching a bus to the metro station at the university. We took the metro into the centre of town and another bus out to the north of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the lake we intended to visit is currently drained and the facilities around it are being renovated. We didn't visit a lake so much as a puddle with a couple of diggers and some puzzled looking ducks. There's also a tower nearby made entirely from wood to a double-helix design conceived by Leonardo da Vinci. It looked abandoned and scary. We made a pretty walk down to the Hermitage museum and visited an exhibition of paintings by Paul Signac. I'll write about that exhibition in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the exhibition we walked down the steep hills back into the city and had dinner in a burger bar - well you have to do that at least once in every country don't you? We bought snacks from the station and headed back to the hotel to pack. Our feet sore: the sign of a good day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we had breakfast and once again pilfered some lunch. After we checked out we tried to visit the botanical gardens but it wasn't the easiest place to walk around with our wheelie bag, so we took the train to Geneva and had a little walk around there to whittle down the hours before our check-in. Our last day in Switzerland was pretty sedate and sunny, and we also bought lots of chocolate for Easter back in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our flight home left late and we were sat in the row ahead of a baby that bawled almost the entire time (still better than being on the same flight as drunk people though!). Then we stood in the cold and rain while our train from Gatwick was delayed. Talk about Britain being quick to remind us that we were back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swiss/Swiss20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Orb - Alpine EP</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/orb-alpine-ep"/>
   <updated>2016-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/orb-alpine-ep</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Orb return with a new EP on the &lt;a href=&quot;www.kompakt.fm&quot;&gt;Kompakt label&lt;/a&gt; called “Alpine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alpine” is split in to three tracks “Morning”, “Evening” and “Dawn”. The third of these was included on the 2016 edition of Kompakt’s annual “Pop Ambient” compilation, a gently drifting track with plenty of bells and yodels. A diversion from the sounds of &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-june-2015/&quot;&gt;Moonbuilding 2703 AD&lt;/a&gt; (and its presumably ongoing remixed companion EPs), but it sat nicely with the other tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alpine Dawn” sounds pretty much how you’d expect an Orb track with this title to sound. It’s pleasant and doesn’t go anywhere in particular. It’s a bit trippy. The other tracks on this EP, as you’d guess from their titles, do not add a great deal more to the mix. “Morning” evolves out of the same blissed out atmospheres as “Dawn” but churns into something a little more awake halfway through - probably in reaction to that cheesy yodel sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Evening” then takes that crunchy dubby beat and runs with it. It’s probably a better beat than any of the rather fiddlier affairs on “Moonbuilding 2703AD”, perhaps it’s not too serious and perhaps because it’s just evolved naturally out of another bit of music. While “Moonbuilding 2703AD” was a welcome return for their longer-form experiments, “Alpine” shows that they sometimes need about twenty minutes to get where they are going. Nevertheless, it bodes well for the future that they can still produce these beautiful slabs of engaging music seemingly out of nowhere. There’s life in the old Orb yet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, David Bowie RIP</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-special-david-bowie"/>
   <updated>2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-special-david-bowie</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d add three of my favourite David Bowie albums to my review of Blackstar to a form an album digest tribute. Also among my favourites but not included here is “Outside”, which will be included in the understated classics (currently it’s number 66) at some point. I thought about bumping “Outside” up the running order but I’d like to be objective about it when its turn comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;station-to-station&quot;&gt;Station To Station&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the side effects of the cocaine / I’m thinking it must be love” sings Bowie on the title track of his tenth studio album “Station To Station”, released in 1976. But this album is most definitely almost entirely built on cocaine, from the weird Kabbalah channeling title track, to the smooth funk of “Golden Years” and on toward to the weepy conclusion of his cover of “Wild Is The Wind”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an album that Bowie claimed he couldn’t remember making. Written and recorded in a period in which he was apparently living on red peppers and milk. And cocaine, lots of cocaine. He was working on the film “The Man Who Fell To Earth” and had become immersed in his character, Thomas Jerome Newton. It was Newton who would inform Bowie’s then stage-persona The Thin White Duke: imagine a scary haunted skinny coke-addled Sinatra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that it’s testament to his songwriting skills that some of his of most interesting songs are on this album, written at a time of near breakdown. “Station To Station” itself twists and contorts through about four parts, some influenced by the Krautrock sounds that would help inform his next three albums, but also built on a traditional rock foundation. It doesn’t feel like ten minutes at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Golden Years” is one of those great Bowie songs like “Fame”, “Sound and Vision” and “Under Pressure” that make it so hard to pin down a list of your favourites. “TVC15” is probably the best song ever written about a television eating Iggy Pop’s girlfriend. “Word on a wing” and “Stay” are both unusual due to their strident religious references but the former in particular just shows what an amazing writer he was: six minutes and not an ounce of extraneous material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heroes&quot;&gt;“Heroes”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being ambitious and having long tracks, “Station To Station” always flies by when I listen to it. Another thoroughly enjoyable album that seems to stick around for just an instant is “Heroes”, the second of the so-called Berlin trilogy. It was a hard toss-up to chose it over “Low” as “Low” contains my all-time favourite Bowie song “Sound and Vision” and an incredible suite of near-instrumentals on its second side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Heroes” is slightly more conventional than its two predecessors, but only just. Everyone knows the amazing title song. It’s about a couple that meets each day to kiss in sight of the guards patrolling the Berlin wall. About how simple acts of love can make powerful and silent stands against tyranny. There are other pop masterpieces on “Heroes” like “Beauty and the Beast” and “V2 Schnieder” (a tribute to Kraftwerk’s Florian Schneider), but the sound is mostly pretty bleak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Blackout” has a wonderful atonal stomp to it and a vocal that may be unmatched in all of the rest of his work - spanning a shouty spoken word section, to the R&amp;amp;B sounds of “Young Americans” to that Bowie-est of Bowie-esque deliveries of the lines between “If you don’t stay tonight” and “I will kiss you in the rain”. Every time I am actively listening to “Heroes” I have to listen to this song two or three times consecutively. As we’ll see when we come to “Blackstar”, it’s one of those Bowie songs that just stands completely out of time and place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, “Sense of Doubt”, “Moss Garden” and “Neukoln” replicate the eerie atmospherics of the second half of “Low”. Though Bowie will be rightly remembered as a man often possessed by songs filled with frenetic energy, it’s also worth remembering how much stillness and calm runs through other parts of his work. It’s a side that is underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heathen&quot;&gt;Heathen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Heathen” should by all rights be a strange mish-mash of a record. It’s three or four songs rescued from the abandoned 2001 album “Toy”, two covers from “Pin-ups 2” that was shelved in the early 80s, and about four songs “informed by” the events of 9/11. Yet somehow, it’s a convincing late peak - one of many if you include “The Next Day” and “Blackstar”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening track “Sunday” is a creepy shimmering track about a forgotten world full of chants and allusions to degredation and decay that only bursts into life in the last minute or so. It borrows much from those quiet moments on “Low” and “Heroes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His cover of the Pixies’ “Cactus” takes a bit of getting used to: he moves from emulating Black Francis in the first verse but by the end he’s giving it the full Bowie treatment. Bands like the Pixies - outsiders driven on by the power their songs and the stories they have to tell - probably owe their existence to Bowie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Slip Away” and “Slow Burn” are both amazing songs that have been largely ignored even though they’d probably be lauded had they been on one of the albums he released prior to 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think “Everyone Says ‘Hi’” is probably the first of the songs that Bowie started writing about knowing he would eventually have to stop writing songs. It just captures that hopeful dislocation of someone getting in touch after a long time apart. I remember hearing it on the radio on my birthday one year and it was wonderful. It’s not a song with a profound artistic statement, in fact it’s benign and domestic, but it has this innate storytelling quality to it. It just reaches for you from out of the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album closes with “A Better Future” which has this brisk and beautiful little eight note riff underpinning the verses, and “Heathen (The Rays)” which revisits the subject matter of the opening track. Both have a downcast outlook, particularly “Heathen” where he asks “Have I stayed too long?” and realises “I can see it now / I can feel it die”. The point here is that Bowie pretty much treated every album like it was his last, that’s why they were usually so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blackstar&quot;&gt;Blackstar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exceptional title track of Blackstar begins “In the villa of Ormen / Stands a solitary candle / In the centre of it all / Your eyes”. If you Google “Ormen” or “villa of Ormen”, you get nothing. Perhaps this is a reference so arcane and obscure that we’ll never know what or where it is. But perhaps it’s just an act, one built from words disguising of others: “the veil of performing”. To me it seems like a song about seeing your pain reflected in the responses of others. The whole ten minutes are remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When “Blackstar” was announced much was made of one PR chap saying that it sounded “pretty out there” and most people, confronted with that downright weird video for the title song, might have agreed. But it is in fact a pretty accessible album, especially when you consider what it says. Some people might find the free jazz noodling on “‘Tis A Pity She Was A Whore” a bit much but it’s a pretty song and the more I listen to it, the more I love the jazz parts. The version of “Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)” is shorter and less obscure than the one on last year’s “Nothing Has Changed” compilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between those jazzy tracks, we have “Lazarus”, another song that will be better remembered for its video and the message seemingly encoded in its title. It is quite simply the best song of what we will no doubt call Bowie’s all-too-short late era of “The Next Day” and “Blackstar”. I don’t think it’s sentimental to say that. When I first heard it I thought about how there would one day be a day where we wouldn’t hear new songs from Bowie ever again. I thought it might be quite soon, that he would soon retire for good. I just didn’t expect it to be two days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three songs are also excellent. I love the mixture of polari and nadsat (the slang from “A Clockwork Orange”) even if it does encode the song to such an extent that you wonder if it means anything at all - but then does it have to? Does Jean Genie? It works well musically, I especially like that self-sample of “Where the fuck did Monday go?” and the rolling sinister synths that start to appear in the mix toward the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dollar Days” and “I Can’t Give It All Away” both sum up his situation in ballad form. The former pokes fun at his place (or lack of it) in the establishment “If I never see the English evergreens I’m running to / It’s nothing to me”, while the latter explores the business of needing to write autobiographically after a lifetime of vowing not to do so: “Saying no but meaning yes / This is all I ever meant / That’s the message that I sent”. Both songs are heartfelt and they tap into that tranquil reflective side of Bowie’s work that I highlighted earlier. It truly is a fitting farewell.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Nutcracker</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-nutcracker"/>
   <updated>2016-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-nutcracker</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For Ingrid’s birthday, we went to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://moscowcityballet.com/en/repertoire/ballet/1&quot;&gt;The Nutcracker performed by the Moscow City Ballet&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingsportsmouth.co.uk&quot;&gt;The King’s Theatre in Southsea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original conversation went something along the lines of “Matt, please come and see some ballet with me on my birthday! It might not be your thing but I’d love someone to come and see it with me”. As I’ve always loved a bit of Tchaikovsky, I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only previous encounter with a ballet was an adaptation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_(ballet)&quot;&gt;Christopher Marlowe’s Edward II by John McCabe&lt;/a&gt; during my English Literature A-level. We got a day trip to exotic Bristol out of it, which when I was 17 meant the chance to visit all the cool record shops looking for rare KLF vinyl that I couldn’t afford. We also got underage hammered at the pub before going to the Hippodrome to watch a ballet in which a man flounced around with a giant pink strap-on on (as if male ballet dancers didn’t have enough of that action going on already!). Needless to say, it did little to convert me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nutcracker is an altogether more benign proposition, full of childlike wonder and hummable tunes. The latter attested to by the elderly gent in the seat next to me suddenly humming the odd couple of notes now and then. I think if any ballet show could win me over it would be this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial set, that of a Christmas party, would normally be a little out-of-place this far into January. But not in Portsmouth ahead of FA cup fourth round weekend. As you may or may not know, hardcore Portsmouth fans don’t take down the decorations until the team is out of the FA cup. Most years this is a wry slight on the team’s tendency to get eliminated at their first sight of a half decent team, but this year is one of those years when fans get to let their tinsel linger a little longer. (At time of writing, this author expects that Ingrid’s flatmate will be taking down his decorations tomorrow!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loved our seats. When we booked online we though that as we were in row D of the stalls, we’d be just a bit back from the action and just right of centre. Lovely. When we sat down though it turned out that rows A to C had been pulled out to make way for the musicians (I’m loathe to say orchestra as there weren’t that many of them) and we had front row seats. It meant that our view of the dancers was perhaps suboptimal but the added frisson of diverting your eyes to watch the musicians at work from time to time was a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first act passed me by a little and I was just getting into the swing of things - oh yes, the dancers are snowflakes now - when it ended. I was struck by two things in particular, both about the movements of the dancers. The first was how beautiful it was to see the dancers making abstract and artificial movements, especially when these are made by two dancers with each one fooling you into thinking one is a part of the other. The second is how you get sucked into the story (even if I didn’t quite follow it until Ingrid explained it at the interval) by the &lt;em&gt;acting&lt;/em&gt; of the dancers. Once I noticed this, I was so impressed: not only are the dancers pulling off beautiful and complicated dance moves, they are telling the story with real emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the second act easier to follow. I recognised a lot of the music and even remembered a few of the titles of the pieces. Tchaikovsky knew his way around a tune and in The Nutcracker he showcases many traditional Russian folk dances that the dancers of the Moscow City Ballet eagerly demonstrate. It was fabulous colourful stuff. I loved the woven stage backdrop of magical creatures and flowers, its gauzy transparency evoking a fanciful dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely night out. We had a nice dinner near to the theatre beforehand in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rosies-vineyard.co.uk&quot;&gt;Rosie’s Vineyard&lt;/a&gt; on Elm Grove. In the interval we got chatting to one of the stewards and we’re now taking &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingsportsmouth.co.uk/whats-on/tours-and-talks/theatre-tours/&quot;&gt;a tour of the theatre&lt;/a&gt; on February 13th, when we’re also seeing the matinée of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingsportsmouth.co.uk/whats-on/musical/spamalot/&quot;&gt;Spamalot!&lt;/a&gt; Great!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Favourite Albums of 2015</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/favourite-albums-of-2015"/>
   <updated>2015-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/favourite-albums-of-2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Given that I gave up on writing album digests for a bit this year, I thought I would at least do a proper top ten list of my favourite albums. There are quite a few albums that I did not have room for and I might try to revisit those later. In the mean time, let’s crack on. (To save time, I have in some instances pasted my original review from the appropriate album digest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-the-magic-whip-by-blur&quot;&gt;10. The Magic Whip by Blur&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this album on the day that I got my new job. What better way to celebrate becoming an economist than by buying an album you’ve already listened to on Spotify? Besides, it has a nice looking cover so why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never that much of a Blur fan. Aside from the singles the first few albums passed me by. After “The Great Escape” I paid more attention, but even then I usually caught up with their albums long after the fact (the one exception being “13”, which I mooned around to in my first year at university). I like “Blur” and “Think Tank” a lot and have considered both of them for inclusion in the understated classics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found “The Magic Whip” to be a good summary of their past records delivered in the form of new songs. That those songs happened to be by various turns cute, sorrowful, apposite and fun was an added bonus. A couple sound like Gorillaz offcuts but the rest is indisputably Blur. There is Parklife and Great Escape aping thrash-along “I Broadcast”, the Blur-the-album-esque “Go Out” and songs like “There Are Too Many Of Us” and “New World Towers” would nestle nicely on “Think Tank”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the album is a solid collection of Blur songs that add to their already impressive back catalogue. If you get to see them live you won’t mind them slipping the best of these into the set. It is rare for comebacks to be this easy and in Blur’s case, they capture themselves both as they were and as they are - not an easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-the-martian-original-score-by-harry-gregson-williams&quot;&gt;9. The Martian Original Score by Harry Gregson-Williams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;/the-martian-a-short-review/&quot;&gt;my review of the movie version of “The Martian”&lt;/a&gt; and this is &lt;a href=&quot;/the-martian-by-andy-weir/&quot;&gt;my review of the book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite soundtrack of the year. I don’t have a great deal to say about it except that for a film as tense as “The Martian”, its soundtrack is surprisingly chilled out. Even the music meant to evoke dust storms is fairly calm, perhaps because its job in the film is to focus you on the astronauts’ actions in response to the storm. It’s more of a soundtrack to an orderly attempt to evacuate than a raging storm. Elsewhere, the score does more work in scenes where Watney totes around Mars looking at pretty red landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: when I get pissed off because my train is late, I put “Sprouting Potatoes” on repeat one. It’s a beautiful little piece and I can’t stay mad when I think of those little green shoots poking up through the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-no-cities-to-love-by-sleater-kinney&quot;&gt;8. No Cities To Love by Sleater-Kinney&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had heard of Sleater-Kinney before their boxed set “Start Together” was released in 2014 but had not ever listened to them. I was quite impressed that they curated their own Spotify playlist with the contents of the box. I added it and even downloaded the songs for offline listening but didn’t get around to much more than a cursory play of a few tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about Spotify playlists is that any additions get pushed out to you. In fact you even get little notifications pushed to your phone. So when S-K released “No Cities To Love” they added it to the “Start Together” playlist and this reminded me to check them out. For now I have just stuck to the new record because it’s good enough to hold my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love a bit of shouty punky guitar music so “No Cities To Love” is perfect for me. It’s really well produced and the songs are beautifully constructed with thoughtful lyrics. Now that I have a walk to work each morning once more, it’s nice to find something amazing to listen to. My favourite songs are the title track (I start my morning walk with it and put the rest of the album on shuffle), “Fangless”, and “Bury Our Friends”. Magnificent stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This review first appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-january-2015/&quot;&gt;January’s Album Digest&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-every-open-eye-by-chvrches&quot;&gt;7. Every Open Eye by Chvrches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Chvrches but I overplayed their debut album “The Bones of What You Believe”. After a while its relentless assault of precision-tooled electro-pop began to grate a little. I swore that if I were to maintain my interest than their second album would have to be more varied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my wish. The four songs trailed ahead of “Every Open Eye” were each different, the best among them being the pseudo title track “Clearest Blue”. The album opens with “Never-ending Circles” which has this monstrous repeating riff that propels the song along, rising and falling like the steps that run atop the impossible building in Escher’s “Belvedere” print. Lead single “Leave A Trace” sees Chvrches adding a little dirt and distortion to their perfect sound. The closer “Afterglow” is beautiful and emotional in a way that no other Chvrches track has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small evolutions like this are what make “Every Open Eye” into a coherent whole. They can write amazing pop songs and have a better grasp of the variation needed to sustain the listener’s interest over a whole album. Their third album is going to be one to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-la-di-da-di-by-battles&quot;&gt;6. La Di Da Di by Battles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most years “La Di Da Di” by Battles would be much nearer to the top of this list. Mainly because I love Battles. In fact this year most of my Battles love manifested in playing Apple Music’s “Intro to Battles” playlist over and over ahead of the release of the new album. By the time my copy arrived, I was almost at peak Battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“La Di Da Di” is a good album that builds on the ground made with “Gloss Drop” despite abandoning the guests that contributed accessibility as well as vocals to Battles’ second album. However, from opener “The Yabba” onward it’s clear that the instrumental-only focus has concentrated Battles’ on making sure that the songs speak for themselves. “La Di Da Di” - as its title suggests - is crammed full of hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the album these hooks get deployed in different ways. On “The Yabba” we get a slow build (side note: check out the totally trippy video for this track), while on “Dot Net” they get straight to their shuffle and keep it going long enough but not too long. Battles’ reputation for tightness and efficiency isn’t just because of their playing, but also how long they play for. They aren’t afraid to play with a simple idea for a little while and then toss it aside. In fact, these shorter and simpler tracks help pace the album with their direct interludes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“FF Bada” has a pretty straightforward structure, it’s my favourite track on the album because it’s direct and fun. The playing on it is immense and it’s great fun to listen to. The way that a little march forms towards the end is fantastic. I bet that if there’s another remix album whoever gets “FF Bada” will have a field day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that some tracks like “Summer Simmer” take a while to get going but they’re worth your patience. These tracks often build slowly into something frenetic and compelling. I imagine that they’re even crazier live. In fact, “Summer Simmer” ends up slowly pealing into a sunset and the following track “Calcio e Pepe” reflects it with its slow opening lines of lyrical feedback. Guest vocalists faced with inventing lyrics for backing tracks like this often come up with something abstract and here without that to be worried about Battles manage to build an emotional connection through their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly some tracks like “Non-Violence” and “Tyne Wear” come over as slightly generic, and perhaps “Tricentennial” sails a bit too close to previous glories, namely “Atlas”. However, elsewhere there are yet more innovations: on “Dot Com” Battles manage to sound like a thrilling modern take on Neu!. In fact, “La Di Da Di” is probably Battles’ most overt acknowledgment of the debt their sound owes to krautrock. I also love the way that the intro to “Megatouch” channels “Uptown Top Ranking” before turning into what sounds like the weirdest sixties cop show theme ever. Finally on “Luu Le” we get Battles deconstructing a jam and turning into a song right before our eyes: it’s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, “La Di Da Di” is enjoyable but it did leave me hankering for the more immediate zaniness of “Gloss Drop” or “Mirrored”. This is another album on which Battles stake out their own terms and create a lot of accessible music from what seem like very inaccessible elements. That alone is a triumph. We also need to acknowledge that this album wins best cover art of the year by quite a long chalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-ten-love-songs-by-susanne-sundfør&quot;&gt;5. Ten Love Songs by Susanne Sundfør&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this album on Spotify’s new releases page and recognised her name. She featured on “Running To The Sea”, one of the best songs on Royksopp’s “The Inevitable End”. As a result I decided to give “Ten Love Songs” a go. I listened to the first minute of the first song “Darlings”, thought “OK this is weird, a bit like an album of Christian show-tunes”, and paused it there and then because it was late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started again the following morning as I walked to work, partly because I didn’t have the time to change to anything else. In that fifteen minute walk I listened to the sequence of the first four songs and was blown away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off “Darlings” swells into a wonderful bittersweet song (the first line is “So it’s definite then? / … everything must come to an end”) that really could be in a musical and then “Accelerate” lurches into your ears, which sounds like ABBA on bad acid: detached Nordic vocals over squelchy bass and a crazy “Phantom of the Opera”-style organ break. And later on in the song, both. At the same time. After that “Fade Away” manages to sound like regular ABBA, which as everyone knows is no bad thing and very hard to pull off. Finally “Silencer” pulls off a wonderful film noir storyline with minimal string backdrop - key lyric: “…no one heard you but the stars / Through the rain of the sprinklers, a bullet pierced your heart”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there the quality remains high, even if the lyrical conceit of “Kamikaze” is a little gauche: you get everything you need to know about the song from the title. Following that, “Memorial” is a ten minute miniature masterpiece of murder and loss in collaboration with M83 (they previously collaborated on M83’s soundtrack to “Oblivion” - &lt;a href=&quot;/oblivion-a-short-review/&quot;&gt;the movie where Tom Cruise takes on aliens WHO BLEW UP THE MOON&lt;/a&gt;). The best bit is when it takes about six minutes off in the middle to explore a miniature classical piece. Throughout the whole album every element of each song sounds amazing and was, apart from three songs, produced by Susanne on her own. “Ten Love Songs” is the work of a major talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Delirious” and “Slowly” are both amazing pop songs. The first begins slowly, perhaps attempting to follow “Memorial” somehow, before it bursts into a playful double-entendre lyric about BDSM. Meanwhile “Slowly” revisits the same territory as “Fade Away” with an 80s vibe that one won’t make you cringe - her vocals are a hair’s breadth of those of Nina Persson on this song, bringing back memories of &lt;a href=&quot;/understated-classics-25-long-gone-before-daylight-cardigans/&quot;&gt;The Cardigans’ excellent “Long Gone Before Daylight” album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two of the ten love songs are “Trust Me” - a slow burning torch song that makes you want to do anything but trust its narrator - and “Insects”, a song in which a swarm of synths tries to overwhelm a lyric about keeping a clandestine sexual relationship a secret. The two combine to create a creepy end to the album, in particular the way that “Trust Me” slows things right down only for “Insects” to pick up the pace again and end the album on the wrong foot. It makes you want to play it all over again. I have done this. Repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only bad thing about “Ten Love Songs” is that there are only ten. It’s one of those rare albums where an artists throws everything on to tape and it all manages to stick and congeal into something fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This review first appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-february-2015/&quot;&gt;February’s Album Digest&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-music-complete-by-new-order&quot;&gt;4. Music Complete by New Order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opener “Restless” sounds like a crap Electronic song at first, even if its lyric is a laudable deconstruction of middle class greed. The fact that it’s so surly and lazy is pretty subversive, there can be few occasions when Bernard Sumner has sounded be jaded and less enthusiastic. It’s certainly a bold gambit to open with such a downbeat song, but toward the end it begins to morph into something more optimistic: “it’s not hopeless / if you take less”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things really take off with “Singularity”. Bass line that shows you don’t miss Hooky. Check. Synth line straight off “Power, Corruption, and Lies”. Check. One of the Chemical Brothers. Check. A chorus straight off “Republic”. Check. Suddenly all that (deliberate, constructed) unease created by “Restless” seems like something of the past. The lyrics are important too, referencing Ian Curtis and Tony Wilson (and probably Peter Hook too, among others). It’s a really muscular song, there hasn’t been this much heft to a New Order track since “Technique”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Plastic” takes the Balearic sound that New Order perfected around “Republic” and pushes it on another notch. (Actually it doesn’t sound a million miles from “Dark Angel”, which is head-and-shoulders the best track on Electronic’s second album “Raise The Pressure”.) There’s a nice Donna Summer vibe to it too. The best bit of all though is the coda, where the cool detached lyric suddenly and briefly becomes intensely personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tutti Frutti” is my favourite song of the year. It starts off like a sleazy threesome between “Relax” by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, “The Model” by Kraftwerk, and New Order’s own “Fine Time”. Somehow it manages to morph into one of their most poppy songs since “True Faith” or, dare I say it, “World In Motion”. It’s the first of several tracks that are lifted by the presence of Elly Jackson (aka La Roux). I often stomp through Chichester miming to this song, I must look pretty scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing a glorious five song opening run is “People on the High Line” which is chock full of housy piano and is strongly reminiscent of their Arthur Baker period. It certainly stands alongside “Touched By The Hand Of God” and the like. The one criticism of it is that it, like “Restless”, might be just a shade too long. Mind you, that extended musical outro sounds a lot like something off “Technique” - a great source of happiness for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, the album dips a bit. “Stray Dog” is a spoken word track narrated by Iggy Pop, which is pretty weird. The worst aspect of it is not that Iggy Pop has nothing on Tom Waits for this kind of thing, but that the instrumental track behind the words is very pretty and probably warrants being heard on its own. “Academic” is too long and too much like something off the previous two albums, though it is saved somewhat by its earnest chorus. “Nothing But A Fool” is also too long, though if you were to isolate the opening ninety seconds as a separate instrumental track, I probably wouldn’t notice. The song itself is nothing to write home about though, especially compared to the first five on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things improve with “Unlearn This Hatred” which features the most modern sounding keyboard sounds on the album. It’s also a lyric crammed with typical New Order lyrics (“Help me win this human race” etc) but as usual it’s done with such giddy abandon that you can’t help but give in to its charms. In fact, I also like “The Game” for pretty much the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have “Superheated” which features Brandon Flowers of The Killers. I refuse to listen to their “Mr. Brightside” because it always takes me right back to a difficult time in my life. And when I heard this song with him on, it reminded me of those same events and how much time has passed since then. It made me think about how great closure is and how important it is to let water go under the bridge. It’s a sweet and earnest end to this album too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many way that this album could have been awful (viz “Waiting For The Sirens’ Call”) and while “Music Complete” doesn’t quite deliver on its title it comes pretty darn close. That opening run of five tracks (or four if you skip straight to “Singularity”) is almost as good as putting on their singles compilation, though of course that is a twenty-odd song run. It almost makes you eager for more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-divers-by-joanna-newsom&quot;&gt;3. Divers by Joanna Newsom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top three albums in this list are - as with most “best of” lists - interchangeable. To shade one album from another in this ranking I’ve used their accessibility. I tend to elevate fun and accessible albums over others. In the case of “Divers” by Joanna Newsom this isn’t fair. Its knotty depths and tangles are chief among its many pleasures. Even so, a list is a list, “Divers” is an album of the year, and no matter how we cut things we have to compare it to the other albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsom’s voice, her reliance on the harp as instrument of choice and her general abandonment of verse-chorus-verse structures are features that we can bemoan as well as celebrate. Let us celebrate them here. Let us celebrate that there is still an artist making music that demands that we listen to it. There is no way that a single song on “Divers” you can allow to skate over you. As background music it fails. But if you sit down with the lyric booklet in hand, the hour of your time that it demands will fly by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main draw is the lyrics. Few songs are stories now, so an album full of songs-as-stories feels like a glut. You need to make time and settle down with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy to describe the opening song “Anecdotes”. I think it is about a child recounting a dream, though it’s only the final, italicised, eight lines of the lyric that lead me to this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next song is a little more obvious, at least if you have the lyrics (and Wikipedia) to hand. “Sapokanikan” is the Lenape name for the area of Manhattan now known as the Meatpacking District. The song is about how the citizens of the modern city now forget and obscure the ruins and memory of Sapokanikan. Newsom connects Tamanent (Chief of the Lenape tribe) to Ozymandias (aka Rameses II) via Shelley’s sonnet of the same name, interpolating the famous line “look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” into the lyrics. The irony is that we know more (in a cultural sense) about Ozymandias’ kingdom than we do about the Lenape native americans. You need the lyric booklet to discern all this though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It is no surprise to see Newsom acting in Paul Thomas Anderson’s recent adaptation of &lt;a href=&quot;/inherent-vice-a-short-review/&quot;&gt;“Inherent Vice”&lt;/a&gt;. Thomas Pynchon’s novels are famous for sprawling over many hundreds of pages stuffed with arcane references and counterfactual histories. &lt;a href=&quot;/on-pynchon/&quot;&gt;I love them&lt;/a&gt;. Each of his novels have wikis that are almost as rewarding to read as the novels themselves. Newsom’s albums might benefit from something similar, collated from the many contributions about her songs to the various song meaning websites out there on t’internet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware that I have not discussed the music. With just the lyrics in front of you, it would be difficult to set them to a tune in your head. Newsom contorts her lyrics around the music. Sometimes the phrasing of a line in the booklet can break in “odd” places compared to the music. The lines in the lyrics don’t always correspond with bars in the music in the ways you might expect in pop songs. This makes it tricky to remember the songs for quite a few listens. This is another reason why paying attention is important while listening to “Divers”. Because the lyric doesn’t always go the way that the music leads, it is easy to get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess there are no more than two choruses on the whole album. Perhaps there are more if you expand your definition of a chorus to “revisiting the same musical phrase with the same or slightly different words”. None of this is a complaint. It’s just difficult to write about this album’s many joys without banging on for ages. It’s also why I will round out my discussion of it having mentioned just two of the eleven songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d urge you to discover the rest of “Divers” for yourself. It’s not on any of the streaming services so you’ll have to pony up the dough for a physical copy. It’ll be worth it. Do what I wish I’d done and get the vinyl! Like many others on this list, “Divers” is a meticulous album that rewards the attention that you give it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-platform-by-holly-herndon&quot;&gt;2. Platform by Holly Herndon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an album that could teach robots to love. It’s excellent. It features pretty much every element I love about dance music and presents it to your with fresh ears. If you bother to listen to just one of my recommendations, make it this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holly is a musician and sound artist, and her compositions on “Platform” skip along that boundary between recognisable music and something other, something we might instead choose to call art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At points it makes me think of &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-october-2012/&quot;&gt;Laurie Spiegel’s experiments in how to create electronic music in the first place&lt;/a&gt;, the experiments of Glass, Reich, and others in making a modern classical music, and then the simple visceral pleasures of techno’s throbs and thuds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere there are tracks that make me think of Prince, James Blake, Grimes, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Anderson&quot;&gt;Laurie Andersen&lt;/a&gt;. Most of it though just sounds utterly unique: all those comparisons are just me clutching at straws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take “Chorus”, it’s propelled along by a throbbing beat and yet dominated by sampled voices. It’s so precise and full of so many small detailed elements that it is impossible to describe in its totality. Of course its idiosyncrasy and defiance of description does not detract one iota from the very real pleasure of listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the thing is things just get weirder and weirder from there. “Unequal” takes what sounds a bit like a medieval plainsong and then wraps it around a barely there beat, before folding in the sounds of running water, bird wings, and samples of poetry. For some people it’s not going to make any sense at all but for the open minded it is genuinely mind expanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Morning Sun” uses a similar formula and is perhaps the most recognisable pop song on the record. It also has a cool video of her walking around on Mars alone, evoking “The Martian”. And again, it’s not just the fact that it sounds so incredible as a whole (and &lt;em&gt;like a pop song&lt;/em&gt; despite of everything that’s in there) but that there is so much internal detail. Not only that, but that it can sound logical despite all the tangents and interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite though is “Locker Leak”, which is part sung, part spoken, and all crazy. It’s full of tongue twisters, puns, and advertising slogans. There’s also a killer beat underpinning it all. I think it says a lot about the crazy mixed up world we live in: a maelstrom of small snippets that make sense on their own but sound surreal (and a little frightening) when all whipped together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Even if you end up hating it, you need to check out this album at least once on your preferred streaming service. (It might be better if you give it more than one try, it takes some getting used to but it’s worth the effort.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This review first appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-june-2015/&quot;&gt;June’s Album Digest&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-art-angels-by-grimes&quot;&gt;1. Art Angels by Grimes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that haven’t changed since Grimes’ last album:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A scary near-severed alien head on the cover&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big chunky pop songs that make you glad to be alive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A smattering of references to old dance records that aren’t cool but are fun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Titles that are too weird for the pop charts (but do those really exist or matter anymore?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Huge choruses (“REALiTi”) that are sometimes unintelligible (“Kill V. Maim”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that are new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ooooh guitars, all over the place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whether it gets noticed or acknowledged by the wider world or not, it is clear that Grimes is a unique talent capable of dictating the cultural zeitgeist (Who do you think is responsible for all that pastel hair dye?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collaboration with Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes (yes, really) that seems to imply that the Taiwanese for “motherfucker” is… “motherfucker”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collaboration with Janelle Monáe that shows that Grimes is one of those artists who simultaneously improves and is improved by her collaborators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Absolute genuine pop bangers: “California”, “Butterfly”, “Flesh Without Blood”, “Artangels”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose there isn’t much more to say than that. Grimes is the real deal and “Art Angels” shows that. I read a post that she put on her Tumblr about a year ago where she wrote about her battles with Tinnitus and her fears that she might have to stop making music. “Art Angels” shows what a tragedy it would be if she had to.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Long Post</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-long-post"/>
   <updated>2015-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-long-post</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am writing a long post that I will either publish as one long post (about five or six thousand words) or as about seven smaller ones each closer to the average post length of about eight hundred words. I have to get it out-of-the-way soon as my mind needs to focus on my health economics essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to write short posts to a timetable, let alone churn out long posts on a regular basis. As a result, this longer post is not likely to become the norm. It’s an idea I had that bloomed into something ever bigger and this time I decided to have a crack at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My WordPress dashboard includes a post that I wrote over two months ago in my “recent” posts. The swanky new WordPress.com app has an insights tab in its stats section that shows a heat map of posts by month and mine are looking rather sparse. Hence this little post to keep things going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been rather busy. I’m an MSc student again, this time doing an MSc in Health Economics at the University of Surrey part-time. This involves a lot of time on the train and though this involves plenty of staring out of the window, it’s caused me to mull over this long post rather than generate lots of ideas for lots of little ones. Nevertheless I feel that the experience of going to lectures, of learning new things and meeting new people, is very satisfying indeed. It is keeping my mind ticking over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard work and at this time of year when you don’t see much daylight it can be a bit tiring. The trains in this part of the world don’t help either. They are never on time and I think it’s getting beyond parody now, they’re that bad. On the other hand, it has been unusually warm this winter. Last year, I was huddled in my flat cursing the broken down boiler. This year I’m still sleeping above my covers like I do in the summer. Anyway, it’s hard work but it’s getting me good marks so I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So keep your eyes peeled for a big post in the next week or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2020 UPDATE: Oops, looks like that never happened. Which is a shame, given that the subject matter was pretty predictive of many events that would follow in the next four or five years.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Underworld, Second Toughest in the Infants (Superdeluxe edition)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/second-toughest-in-the-infants-superdeluxe"/>
   <updated>2015-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/second-toughest-in-the-infants-superdeluxe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week Underworld reissued their excellent second album “Second Toughest In The Infants” in various formats including a four disc super deluxe edition. I wrote about this album in my understated classics series and I want to share some thoughts on the reissue. I love this album so I was excited to hear the remaster and the additional material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t comment on the physical version of the release as I can’t afford it at the moment. I also had to wait to buy the gorgeous yellow reissue of “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” but the “Second Toughest In The Infants” box is on the list. Underworld do a really good job on the boxes with interesting artwork to accompany the large volume of material. If the “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” box is anything to go by, the new one will be pretty hefty on the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The super deluxe edition comes as four discs. The first disc is the original album remastered. The second collects B-sides and remixes. The third disc comprises unreleased tracks and demos. The fourth disc is devoted to collecting demos and live performances of “Born Slippy (NUXX)”. The idea is to demonstrate how the track evolved from demo to finished track. Since “Born Slippy (NUXX)” is Underworld’s best known track, this makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dubnobasswithmyheadman” sounded cleaner and clearer after its audio polish. But the remaster doesn’t seem to change “Second Toughest In The Infants” quite so much. I think this is because it was recorded in a better studio with better gear. Identifying the effect of remastering on electronic music is difficult anyway. How do you improve sounds that only exist on hard drives and optical discs? I’m no audiophile, but the album does seem a little brighter. I noticed more detail in the end section of “Sappy’s Curry”. The competing keyboard lines are more distinct from one another, creating a dizzying effect. Elsewhere the remaster reminded me how much guitar there is on this album, which I’d not noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own the “Pearl’s Girl” single so I know its four B-sides like the back of my hand. They sound good remastered, in particular “Oich Oich”. It’s exciting to hear one of my favourite Underworld songs so improved. Also included are the original instrumental version of “Born Slippy” and the “NUXX deep pan” version. I’ll talk about those when discussing disc four. Rounding out disc two are the B-sides and alternate mixes from the reissued version of “Pearl’s Girl”. It is disappointing that these reissues include so few third-party remixes: for example, the Alex Reece version of “Banstyle” from the NUXX singles is missing. It is a shame that there is no room for the “carp dreams… koi” mix of “Pearl’s Girl” which is also a personal favourite of mine. There is a lot of good material for people who haven’t collected this stuff over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third disc is of most interest to fans and collectors. The great thing about the “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” remaster was how it made you privy to the different versions and directions that various songs took. There were demos of abandoned songs. There were versions of classic tracks like “Dirty” and “MMM Skyscraper I Love You” that demonstrated how the different components of those songs were cast into their final versions. Unfortunately there is less of that sort of material here. Although a few of the tracks have the same name as they do on the album, you will recognise most of them as components of tracks that made the final cut. There are only a few blind alleys and offcuts to enjoy here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is “Bug” which is an abandoned track that sounds like “River of Bass”. I guess it was discarded because it didn’t fit on to the album and “Stagger” is a far superior song. Very little of the material on these CDs is this mellow so it makes for a nice addition to “Sappy’s Curry”, “Stagger” and “Deep Arch”. “D’Arbly Street” is the instrumental sketch of “Stagger” and serves to show just how much Karl’s vocals take that song into a completely different place. This is my main problem, there’s just not enough of Karl, and without him the demos and sketches just seem perfunctory. “Rowla A1806” is the most interesting demo here, it has vocals that were dropped and the venom of the instrumental version is absent. “Pearls (Version 2)” is an intense hardcore version of the original that is very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bloody 1” is a sixteen minute outline of what would become “Juanita: Kiteless: To Dream Of Love”. It features very little of what I’d recognise of “Juanita” (very frustrating that none of these demos do) but it’s immense. At the start it feels like the “Dark Train” mix of “Dark &amp;amp; Long” and it features lyrics from “To Dream Of Love” that are clearer than the album version. When you listen to it you realise that they must have had the great idea of a great big long intro track pretty early on. You also get an impression of just how much work they did to make “Juanita: Kiteless: To Dream Of Love” so awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the fourth disc of NUXX demos. The first thing that struck me is just how well-formed “Nuxx” was in the first demo presented here (“Nuxx A1796”). Most of the lyric is ready and most of that fantastic drumbeat is there too. What’s missing are the amazing drops and some of the performance of the vocal. At this stage they aren’t really sure about the vocal as some sections get smothered in unnecessary reverb including a line or two reciting a fried breakfast order. “Nuxx A2221” is very weird and they’re looking for a killer sound to couple with that drum beat. For the first few minutes they try the synth sound from “Texas Cowboys” by The Grid. However this version is 12 minutes long and by the end they have figured out the strange helicopter-like noises that made it on to the final version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nuxx A4712” is where they hit on that choral bit that makes the slow bits of “Born Slippy” so hair-raising. Unfortunately they’re also still playing that “Texas Cowboys” riff as well. “Nuxx A4733” is “Nuxx” done in the same vein as “Dark Train” with a propulsive riff underpinning the track but the vocal suffers as it can no longer keep up with backing. The “Lager lager lager” line sounds particularly unconvincing. “Nuxx A2254” returns to the drums, postponing the “Dark Train”-style bits to the end with an interesting riff around the nine minute mark. “Nuxx A1825” has the vocal and the down tempo choral bits nailed but it veers off close to drum’n’bass territory at points: whenever they use the original drum line it sounds magnificent. Then to cap it off, you get the original and it is a testament to the track that even after six other versions you can still listen to it all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, this remaster is not quite as good as the “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” one but only because “Second Toughest In The Infants” is a better album and there isn’t the abundance of rare material to stuff the extra discs with. The incremental versions of “Born Slippy (NUXX)” are interesting though with the limited replay value. Let’s just hope they manage to find more material for the “Beaucoup Fish” reissue next year.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Satin Island by Tom McCarthy: Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review"/>
   <updated>2015-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As much as I wanted it to, Satin Island by Tom McCarthy did not win the Booker Prize. Having read it all I realise it was a long shot. However it is an interesting book that deserved consideration, even if it does have some flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I promise that there will be no spoilers. Not this time. There are some spoilers here. Because it took me so long to work out what I thought Satin Island was actually about, I want to use this post to explore those ideas. I promise to keep the amount of plot exposed to a minimum. Given that at first glance the novel appears plotless, I shouldn’t have too much trouble. &lt;strong&gt;However, please read the novel before you read this review, unless you don’t intend to read it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search for Satin Island on Amazon, the first six books you find are it and its five co-nominees for the Booker. Satin Island even comes sixth on the list! Its rating of two and a half stars out of five is poor compared to the four out of five given to most of the other nominees. (I note that Sunjeev Sahota’s The Year of the Runaways has four and a half out of five, making it the most popular Booker nominee on Amazon. Perhaps that’s the book I should read next…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is “Satin Island” does not have universal appeal. It is pretty hard to “get”. Some of this is down to its rarefied subject matter: it’s a first person narrative by a “corporate anthropologist” who refers to himself as “U.”. As in “call me U.” - one of the novels many feints and tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He - and it was a fair way through before I was certain that U. is a man - works for a shadowy consultancy on a top-secret project called “Koob-Sassen” that involves multiple agencies, including the government. The project seems to echo the work of Carter-Ruck for Trafigura, which culminated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/10/20/SUPER-INJUNCTION.pdf&quot;&gt;the Guardian revealing the existence of super-injunctions in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. McCarthy structures the novel in numbered sections like a legal document (1.1, 1.2, etc) or like a philosophical treatise à la Wittgenstein’s “Tractatus” with its propositions and sublevels thereof. While this structure is not particularly welcoming when you flick through the book in the bookshop, it is a useful device for driving you through the book once it draws  in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning what a super-injunction is. It is a legal document that not only prevents named individuals from talking about an ongoing legal case but also prevents them from talking about the fact they cannot talk about it. That such documents exist, things that are almost guaranteed to exist because the fact that no one can talk about them, seem to me to put the world out of kilter. The nature of U’s philosophical and ethnographical peregrinations hint at similar constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“U.” has to somehow sum up the Koob-Sassen project for his masters. He has to come up with an idea that &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt; “the spirit of the age”. His boss Peyman pops up from time to time to issue &lt;em&gt;mots justes&lt;/em&gt; that border on self-satire. Somehow, despite almost never being directly included in the action, Peyman manages to ooze the same menace as an antagonist from a Ballard novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U’s task mostly ends up with him musing on the issues of the day (an oil spill, an aeroplane incident that leaves him stranded at Turin airport, the death of a parachutist, a football match betwen Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and so on…) and surfing the internet. This is woven between interactions with his girlfriend Madison and the death of his friend Petr from cancer. These personal events are narrated in a detached fashion. Discussion of sex is dispatched in short perfunctory sentences such as “we made love”. As U. relates his conversations with his dying friend to the reader, he also describes simultaneous thought processes, showing how his mind is always working away to make connections between things - no matter the situation. He comes across as detached and the writing has a similar quality to Nicola Barker’s “Darkmans” (as I mentioned last time I wrote about “Satin Island”), wherein the narrator decides to hop from one thing to another in the search for a plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is pretty much the entirety of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it all mean? I came to the conclusion that one interpretation of the novel is that it could be a meditation on suicide. First of all, the Satin Island of the title is a reference to a parachute. U. muses for a long time on the case of the parachutist who has the cords of his chute cut. He comes to the conclusion that it was a bizarre form of thrill-seeking Russian roulette amongst the victim’s parachute club. He finds out that this would be impossible. Eventually he comes to realise that the only person who could have cut the cords is the dead parachutist himself. This is confirmed when he starts to see similar stories of other parachutes around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U. also describes an anthropological ritual involving falling that he remembers learning about an re-enacting as a child. Along with U’s detachment from the world, perhaps the obsession with parachute deaths is his ideation for how he will kill himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final chapter U. visits the terminal for the Staten Island ferry in New York. He thrills at the arrangement of broken letters that from one angle appear to spell SATN ISLND. However he doesn’t board the ferry and visit the island, knowing already that there is little there for him to see. He observes the crowds and withdraws, against the grain. You could see this as U. rejecting life and refusing to reach his destination, but given the echoes of the river Styx in the narrative, it’s also possible to view it as U. rejecting the chance to accept death. He walks away from it instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be the true meaning of Satin Island. It doesn’t really explain the bizarre tale related in chapter 13 by U.’s girlfriend Madison, among other things. I’m ok with that, because with such an open-ended tale you won’t find a theory to fit everything no matter how you try. It’s the author’s prerogative to know whether there’s a meaning and whether to disclose it. It is more like that the author’s intention is open-endedness and because Satin Island is a modern novel about modern people doing modern things and thinking in modern ways, ambiguity is always likely. It’s the reader’s prerogative to read attentively and discern meaning: at least it is in these times with every narrative fractured into a multiplicity of viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there is the problem of legitimacy: if Satin Island has a plot that exists only in the mind of the reader, is it good writing? Is it a good novel? I would say yes because throughout the writing is excellent. It is difficult for a writer to convey the thought processes of an invented character and I think McCarthy does this very well. But then again, as those Amazon reviews suggest, some people respond badly to this and have a very different idea of what a novel is. At the end of the day, this is what will determine whether you love or loathe Satin Island. Which is perhaps as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #32: They Were Wrong So We Drowned by Liars</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-32"/>
   <updated>2015-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-32</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As it is Halloween, I’m writing about a spooky understated classic. Liars’ second album “They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” is a concept album about witches. It was the first of their albums that I owned having heard their name mentioned among those in the New York Post-punk revival scene at the start of the 00s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine that to most ears a first listen to “They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” sounds dreadful. I certainly thought so. It’s a short album and if you plough through it there are one or two nuggets that would sound great on most albums - but a lot of it initially seems to be noise and chanting and screaming. If anyone wants to make the argument that Liars are not worth the trouble, not worth the effort to like or understand, then “They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” is the album they will use as ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I revisited “They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” over the last month or so in preparation for this post (I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; listen to the album I’m writing about), it surprised me just how much I enjoyed listening to it. I approached it with some trepidation, and I even thought that I should perhaps write about “Drum’s Not Dead” instead. However while I listened to it for the first time in years at night and on the train, I found it to be a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one of the reasons why I like “They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” so much more than I did back in 2003 is because I’ve listened to so much more music since then. I’ve come to love music that exists at the margin of noise and melody. I’ve discovered bands like CAN and Neu! who build tracks out of groove and texture. I’m much more appreciative of the effort it takes to bend songs out of typical lyrical constraints and out of conventional structure. I’ve listened to hell of a lot more music by Tom Waits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” informs Liars’ subsequent work: its financial flop forced them to hunker down and renovate the studio in which they’d record “Drum’s Not Dead”; its weirdness gave them something to react against on their eponymous album; its structure helped them to pull off a similar feat of (more approachable) story telling on “Sisterworld”; and, of course, if you listen carefully, you can hear its influence on the simultaneously accessible and experimental aspects of last year’s seventh album “Mess”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your eperience of “They Were Wrong, So We Drowned”, the good news is that it’s going to take you about six minutes to work out whether you will like it. Those six minutes are the duration of the opening track “Broken Witch”. It begins with some dark slurps of synth that sound almost like alarms, interupted by a burst of rattling drums redolent of those witchy stick constructions that you find in the woods (hence the cover image of this post). As the vocal enters and strikes up a spell-chant, there’s a nice twisty Marc-Ribot-esque guitar line that underpins it. It all clatters along as though it will all fall to pieces at any second, held together merely by sheer force of will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, I imagine most people might turn off after about two and a half minutes when we get the word “blood” chanted repetitively for about thirty seconds. Remember all those supposedly satanic albums that those concerned parents wrote about to the Daily Mail? Well this is one of those. If you can handle the subject matter, including some tongue in cheek stuff about wanting to be transformed into a horse (“men have small hearts / I need a … tail / Tell me a tale…”), then it turns into a great rave-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Steam Rose From The Lifeless Cloak” is a transitional instrumental piece, one of the bits of the album that makes a lot more sense once you’ve heard a few albums by CAN. Meanwhile “There’s Always Room On The Broom” is the one song that could have been on their first album, a post-punk retelling of an episode of “Sabrina The Teenage Witch” (no, not really). It’s great and I think back in 2003 I really wanted the album to be “Broken Witch” and nine clones of this song. It’s the only song on the whole album that’s direct enough to merit automatic inclusion on your Halloween playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next song “If You’re A Wizard Then Why Do You Wear Glasses?” (Good diss of Harry Potter guys!) is another transitional piece: it’s mostly instrumental with some mumbling and some screams at the end. It’s connective tissue I guess. It leads into “We Fenced Other Houses With The Bones Of Our Own” which skulks along on a beat that has all the infernal twitchiness of a steam powered ghost train. The lyrics are mostly about cauldrons and descend into more spell-like chanting. I think that what I understand now is that the entirety of “They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” is an ensemble and that individual tracks present different facets of the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With “They Don’t Want Your Corn, They Want Your Kids” the album suddenly takes a lurch into political territory with a song about how witch hunts are designed to distract the poor from the real issues that face them. It’s surprisingly accessible, perhaps helped by having about the second best arrangement on the record - a twitchy pulsating affair. It’s frustrating that its momentum then gets cut away with another instrumental interlude “Read The Book That Wrote Itself”, albeit one that features some superb and spooky drumming. If you fall asleep listening to this one, you will definitely end up dreaming of getting trapped in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the political theme and the tempo return on “Hold Hands and It Will Happen Anyway”. I’m not sure how I never noticed the fantastic guitar work on this song, it’s fantastic: horror movie surf guitar anyone? Like “…Broom” it’s a shouty track and all the more enjoyable for being one of the more structured songs on the album. The last minute or so is compelling, descending into a chant of “choke/choke/the devil we invoke”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They Took It For The Rest Of Our Lives” maintains the tempo but returns to the clatter and clang of “Broken Witch”. Imagine CAN playing live at Dracula’s castle and you’ve got the sound and the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” closes with “Flow My Tears The Spider Said” - a slow song based around a creepy organ and a lyric that recounts the themes of the album as a whole. It’s a theatrical end to the album that sums the whole thing up like a Shakespearean epilogue. The organ riff spookily shimmers into a haze of reverb and gets replaced with an eerie vocal line. After a while a clank of slow percussion begins that sounds like wind chimes or the slow progress of a clock mechanism. The last sounds you hear are bird song, almost as though the night is over and the sun is rising once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They Were Wrong, So We Drowned” is not an easy album to like, let alone love. However it is completely infused with its subject matter. If it were an actor, it’d be method acting right to the end of the performance. It’s dark and scary. It never breaks character. It is an album whose pleasures are many but often hidden, revealed over a longer time scale than those of more conventional albums. Why not find a copy this halloween and crank it out loud? Even if you hate it, it’ll probably scare off the trick-or-treaters!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Martian: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-martian-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2015-10-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-martian-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/the-martian-by-andy-weir/&quot;&gt;In my review of the book&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned that a film adaptation of The Martian was on the way. I’m not sure why but it got released earlier than any of the dates that I’d seen and so on Saturday I found myself watching The Martian on the big screen. Could the film version deliver the same level of entertainment as the novel? Could Mark Watney (Matt Damon) get off Mars alive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short answers are (spoiler alert!) yes and yes. The Martian is at least as enjoyable as a film as it is a novel. The change in medium has both pros and cons, but overall it’s great fun whether you’ve read the book already or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my blog post about the novel, I wrote about what I perceived to be the filmic qualities of the writing about the Martian surface and the computer generated shots of the landscape are stunning. What’s more the film also looks fantastic at the “suit level”, there’s great attention to detail in the structure of the habitat module &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/inside-martian-movies-sleek-spacesuits-explained-183716716.html&quot;&gt;and the space suits&lt;/a&gt;. It’s almost a shame that this convincing detail almost gets overlooked by the need to propel the film along, I’d love to have luxuriated in the world building of the film. I bet there’ll be a stack of extras with the Blu-ray in a few months time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a long film, not that a great deal of it feels extraneous or forced. One of the weaknesses of novel is that the story unfolding back on earth and on the Hermes ship felt a little forced and underwritten compared to the experiences of Mark Watney on Mars. I think that the film goes a little way to address these issues and that pads out the run time. There are some good supporting performances from Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kirsten Whig, and Mackenzie Davis (it took me a good few hours for me to realise that I’d recognised her from the excellent TV show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amc.com/shows/halt-and-catch-fire&quot;&gt;“Halt and Catch Fire”&lt;/a&gt;). As an ensemble piece, it’s solid rather than spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/the_martian_xkcd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Damon does a good job as Mark Watney, though I think the film presents Watney as more of an action hero than the book does. Plenty of the charm and wit comes through, with a large amount of the diary entries of the novel taken verbatim and presented in a video diary format. There are a few awkward moments where I noticed the camera work and found that it was breaking my belief that he was alone: in space no one can hear you scream except the camera crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plot-wise plenty has been cut from the book but as I’ve said, it’s actually a pretty long film and sticking to it slavishly would require a TV series. Because the novel was originally a serial there are a lot of twists and for the film a few had to be straightened out lest it go full Avatar (i.e. go on forever). What remains is still pretty twisty. I was disappointed that a great scene with a dust storm was omitted, but maybe it’s a deleted scene on the DVD or maybe there’s an extended cut. Maybe that extended cut should just be a quick re-read of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Martian” is a good film with plenty to keep you entertained. The score and soundtrack are both excellent too, I think the former might be my “slip off to sleep” soundtrack for a few months: with lots of gauzy drones and cute little piano loops, it seems indebted to Brian Eno’s “Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks”. The soundtrack is mostly disco (this is a plot point) and provides some uplifting and amusing moments throughout. Naturally the end credits roll to the sound of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive”, which is a nice touch. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Booker Prize Pick 2015</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/booker-prize-pick-2015"/>
   <updated>2015-10-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/booker-prize-pick-2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/man-booker-shortlist-2015-satin-island/408784/&quot;&gt;Satin Island&lt;/a&gt;” is my pick for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://themanbookerprize.com/man-booker-prize-2015&quot;&gt;Man Booker prize&lt;/a&gt;, announced tomorrow. I’ve not managed to read all of it yet. Also, I’ve only glanced at the others on &lt;a href=&quot;http://themanbookerprize.com/news/man-booker-prize-fiction-2015-shortlist-revealed&quot;&gt;the shortlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My prediction record on selecting the winner of the Booker from the shortlist is pretty good, though all I’m ever doing is guess the outcome of a 1 in 6 chance, like the roll of a die. Often it’s a book that I really hope will win rather than one I know will (except “Wolf Hall” and its sequel). I still think the world is a worse place for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/3665324/Man-Booker-2007-Prize-Darkmans.html&quot;&gt;Nicola Barker’s “Darkmans”&lt;/a&gt; not winning the prize back in 2007. I was delighted when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/11/books.bookerprize2006&quot;&gt;Kiran Desai’s “The Inheritance of Loss” won the previous year&lt;/a&gt;. That’s part of my affection for “Satin Island”, it’s a book that will make people go “huh?” if they’re driven to reading it via a prize win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously McCarthy has come to my attention before. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(novel)&quot;&gt;“C” was nominated in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, the year that Howard Jacobson’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://themanbookerprize.com/books/finkler-question&quot;&gt;“The Finkler Question”&lt;/a&gt; won. I was determined to read “C” anyway but somehow never did: I’d been intrigued by its titular similarity to Pynchon’s “V” and the scribbly cover of its first edition (not the awful American cover &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(novel)&quot;&gt;on the wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for the novel). Generally when an author gets Booker nominated for two consecutive novels, it’s a sign that they are doing something right, hence my interest in “Satin Island”. This is with the usual caveats that prizes don’t detect good writing, you do, but they do tend to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve read so far, Satin Island is an interesting take on what the novel might become rather than a shining example of technique. What I mean is that - at least for now - Satin Island strikes me as a worthy winner for its imagination and innovation in taking the novel as a form forwards. In the chapters I’ve read so far, it’s full of ideas and thoughts and hops between them consummately. However, I’ll only know if it’s worth persisting with if I manage to persist with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite short (the shortest of the remaining nominations by a fair way) so I should get through it in the next week or so. Expect a short review around then - especially if it wins tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ben Elton, Time and Time Again</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/time-and-time-again-by-ben-elton"/>
   <updated>2015-09-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/time-and-time-again-by-ben-elton</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time and Time Again is a ridiculously stupid novel by Ben Elton. A shadowy sect (established by Isaac Newton no less!) recruits a soldier to go back in time and prevent Franz Ferdinand’s assassination in Sarajevo in August 1914. I wonder if it all goes to plan and everyone lives happily ever after with no weird timey-wimey after-effects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say &lt;strong&gt;this novel makes me wish that time travel were a real thing so that I could travel back in time and slap myself in the face while in the queue to buy this tripe.&lt;/strong&gt; I usually try to see the best in the books, albums and movies that I write about, but the most fun you can have with this novel is to rip it to shreds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main character Hugh “Guts” Stanton is a self-pitying sad-sack that Elton expects us to believe graduated from Cambridge. He is thoroughly unlikable: I spent most of the novel hoping that he’d meet some grizzly end rather than succeed in his goal. Apparently all it takes is a poorly written caricature of a sad-sack soldier for me to start siding with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-Hand-secret-Serbian-society&quot;&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted world war one to start anyway, just to spite this guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanton is so thinly drawn, you might think Ben Elton used a template from one of those “How to write your bestseller in 30 days” books. Poor characterisation could be excused if this were a novel that your crazy uncle wrote at his creative writing lessons: at least it got him out of the house for a bit. But this is a novel by Ben Elton, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyquotes.tv/blackadder-iv-episode-1-captain-cook-script/&quot;&gt;who wrote scripts for Blackadder&lt;/a&gt;. He’s supposed to be pretty good at this stuff. Blackadder Goes Forth and its poignant yet enormously funny treatment of the Great War is one of the biggest reasons why people will bother to pick up this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sections featuring Isaac Newton read like extracts from the journal of someone who has had a particularly vivid cheese dream the night after binge watching Wolf Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the affable Cambridge don who recruits Hugh to this hare-brained scheme? Well she’s probably the best thing in the book, a sort of cross between Stephen Fry and one of the two fat ladies. (Incidentally, as fun and frothy alternate history novels go, you’d be well advised to pick up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317457.Making_History&quot;&gt;Fry’s “Making History” which covers similar territory with considerably more aplomb&lt;/a&gt;). However, Elton decides halfway through that’s she’s going to be evil and bumps her off just as her comic potential begins to dawn on the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gallumphing intellectual set loose on the past is more preferable to what actually ensues - a love interest who is (of course!) a suffragette and guess what?! She’s irish. Or rather “oirish” as Elton insists on adding italicised &lt;em&gt;potayto ta bee shure&lt;/em&gt; repetitions after every instance of her reported speech. In 2015! What the heck was Ben Elton thinking? Why the hell didn’t whoever was editing this say something? Was there even an editor? I’m almost certain that there wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate thing is that in a mirror to the plot of this book, the paths untaken and the ripples that travel out from those choices mean that it is possible to see a better story within the mess. The last five chapters are more interesting as Ben Elton’s construction of time travel is clever enough to include a mechanism for timelines to cross over, so we get to see the onward effects of time travel. However, those alternate time lines and their impact should have more emphasis in the plot. After all, isn’t that what you expect from a title like “Time and Time Again”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I’d advise that you do not buy this book. Instead, please invent a time machine and pinch my copy from me last Thursday. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>South America, Part 11</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-11"/>
   <updated>2015-09-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-11</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;la-paz-to-potosi&quot;&gt;La Paz to Potosi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left La Paz, this time ascending the rim of steep hills around the city in a slightly less clunky “Death Bus”. Perhaps it was because we were travelling uphill or because it was daylight, but it didn’t seem so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off to Potosi through strange towns with weird monuments (see the pictures) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia/the-southwest/oruro/travel-tips-and-articles/76305&quot;&gt;Oruro where great festivals happen around Ash Wednesday each year&lt;/a&gt; that are famous throughout the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had lunch by the side of the road just after Oruro. We had a strange fruit from La Paz for dessert: I have a picture of the outside but I can no longer remember their names. Inside, the fruit had red flesh and quite a few pips. It didn’t taste particularly sweet, it was a bit tart but not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got in to Potosi quite late. I made lots of attempts to snap the imposing countryside - including the Cerro de Potosi. This was the highest point of the tour. The advice is to avoid alcohol because it’s so high up but a few of us did and it just felt as though you were drinking while very tired. The altitude didn’t really affect any of us, unlike in Quito and on the Inca trail where some of us suffered a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;potosi&quot;&gt;Potosi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel was one of those built around a central atrium and it rained heavily during the night, a clattering sound on the glass roof. It was a pretty place, certainly one of the better places we stayed in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, after breakfast in a strangely greenhouse-like dining room on top of the hotel, we took a trip to the mint museum. It tells the history of the town and story of the mining operation in the hills around it. As I alluded to in my post about Lake Titicaca, the natives for hundreds of miles around were swept up into the mines and worked to death for silver. At that time almost all Spain’s silver came out of the mines of one mountain - the Cerro de Potosi. The work was difficult and dangerous, and if they weren’t injured then silicosis would eventually kill them. The conditions were terrible. The average life expectancy was about six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is that people are still mining the mountains in the area and conditions are barely better. Later that evening we watched a heartbreaking documentary at the hotel about children struggling to make a living from the near-depleted mines. And of course it’s not just Bolivia: almost everywhere that minerals are mined, children are exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go on mine tours too. I opted not to as I already feeling a bit down (the week or two after the visit to Machu Picchu were a bit of a come-down really). A few people went and said that it was a depressing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After insisting on a quick coffee and a lemon pie, we set out to find the famous flying saucer café but got halted by rain and general difficulty in finding a good walking route to get there. It was probably closed, like almost everywhere else. Potosi is a bit depressing in the rain (where isn’t?) and because it was early in the new year, there weren’t a great number of places to eat that were open. We ended up in the same place for both evening meals but not for the lack of trying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uyuni-and-the-salt-flats&quot;&gt;Uyuni and the salt flats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we headed out for Uyuni and its salt flats. We made it in good time as the Bolivian government have invested in new roads for the area as it now hosts one of the legs of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dakar.com/index_DAKus.html&quot;&gt;Dakar rally&lt;/a&gt;. The trans-continental race was moved to South America a few years ago under the threat of terrorism and now thrives there. No longer intercontinental, it takes a different route each year through two or three different countries. The 2014 route was from Rosario to Salta (both in Argentina) to Valparaiso (in Chile). The section through Uyuni was only for bikes and quads, the participating cars and trucks had to make do with Salta (more on which in Part 12). Nevertheless the Dakar rally brand was everywhere in Uyuni, just one more bit of merchandise for the hawkers. (And apparently the reason for there being no internet, they were upgrading the cable ahead of the race… apparently)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uyuni is a military town and the hotel was right next to a military base. The first morning there I listened to a drill taking place while I was in the shower. The hotel was also partly a pizza restaurant apparently famed for being the best pizzeria in South America (Minuteman Pizza). I’m not sure this was the case, it was pretty good but I just used it as an excuse to have pizza for dinner two nights in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our full day in Uyuni we took a trip out in jeeps to visit the salt flats and the train graveyard. We had dinosaur props and all sorts ready to emulate the wacky false perspective pictures from the salt flats that adorn the walls of the Minuteman Pizza restaurant. Unfortunately due to recent storms, the flats were a little flooded but these made for some dramatic pictures too. We found some dry areas and arsed about a bit, I include some pictures below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the salt flats there is a hotel made of salt. It’s also the only place for miles around with toilets. I can remember going to the loo and looking through a hole in the wall (which was made of salt) to everyone milling around outside. It was rather surreal. So surreal that I took a photo! (Something that I had forgotten until I looked for pictures to accompany this post!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning the sun was shining and the sky was that deep blue that you get wherever there is a lot of white around (think of Greek Islands or Caribbean beaches) but by lunchtime another glowering storm was coming in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the salt flats we paid a visit to the train graveyard. By this time the rain was upon us - so instead of pictures of rusting industrial hulks set against a cerulean blue (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=uyuni%20trains&quot;&gt;very popular on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;), I have them all set against gun metal grey skies and rain instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_11/22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening the storm really hit and the hotel had a power cut. We watched Doctor Who on dwindling laptop batteries and played cards by torchlight unable to hear much for the sound of rain and hail clattering on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Eric Schlosser, Gods of Metal</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/gods-of-metal"/>
   <updated>2015-09-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/gods-of-metal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Y-12 is the United States’ most secure weapons-grade Uranium storage facility. It is known as the “Fort Knox of Uranium”. In 2012 it was infiltrated by three elderly peace protesters, sparking a major scandal about the safety of US nuclear sites. “Gods of Metal” by Eric Schlosser tells the story of that break-in alongside a history of both the anti-nuclear movement (in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plowshares_Movement&quot;&gt;the Plowshares movement&lt;/a&gt;) and nuclear security in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A revision of an article that originally appeared in the New Yorker as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/09/break-in-at-y-12&quot;&gt;“Break-In at Y-12”&lt;/a&gt;, “Gods of Metal” is a small short-form book (a “Penguin Special”) of about 120 pages that you can read in one or two sittings. It is also a companion to Schlosser’s most recent book “Command and Control”, which is a history of nuclear safety in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title “Gods of Metal” refers to the Plowshares movement’s belief that nuclear weapons are revered idolatrously in the blind faith that they keep us safe.
I found “Gods of Metal” illuminating from three perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the issue of security surrounding nuclear material is paramount. This book is terrifying. The ease with which the group, including an 82 year old nun with a heart condition, gains access to Y-12 is frightening. As Schlosser explains, the danger is not the theft of weapons or bombs but of highly radioactive material. The thought of rogue states or terrorists acquiring such material is the stuff of nightmares. The thought of them doing so by walking into a supposedly secure facility unchallenged is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all mankind’s existential threats, nuclear weapons remain the second greatest after an asteroid strike. (Second greatest because, if we wanted to, human beings could eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons to their existence by adopting universal disarmament.) Although this book focusses mainly on the break-in at the Tennessee facility, Schlosser also draws attention to the frightening implications of current instabilities in Pakistan and Russia for the security of nuclear weapons stock in those countries. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/18/fallon-urged-act-whistleblowers-claims-trident-nuclear-subs&quot;&gt;This year in the UK, a Royal Navy employee blew the whistle on lax security procedures at the Trident nuclear submarine base in Faslane, Scotland.&lt;/a&gt; It seems that while these weapons and the materials to build them exist, we will always have this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles&quot;&gt;sword of Damocles&lt;/a&gt; hanging over our head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, this book makes a strong case against private sector involvement in the affairs of government. I’m aware that it’s a little different in the states because Federal government is one thing and State law is another, and there’s weirdness about how the two interact. Nevertheless a long list of failings is laid down at the door of private contractors and makes for stark reading for even the most ardent of neoliberals. It will be a source of some amusement to British readers that the corporation G4S is involved in this mesh of private contractors. G4S is the poster-child for the ill-effects of private-public partnerships. Their shadowy influence, malign incompetence, and dangerous cost-cutting reaches into all walks of life all over the world. And while it’s easy enough to single out G4S, we should be uneasy about all situations in which private companies are asked to provide a critical service of quality while under market pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, it seems to me that protest movements are more important now than they have ever been. If an 82 year old nun breaking in to a site handling weapons-grade uranium unchallenged seems pretty surreal, that’s because it is. We may feel that the arguments over nuclear weapons are won. The cold war is over (kind of) and nuclear weapons played an important role in bringing that about. But if people like Sister Megan Rice did not continue to protest nuclear weapons then the first break-in to one of these bases would have been by terrorists. Who will take up this mantle when people like her are gone? What are we giving away when we allow legislation that erodes our right to protest? Moreover, Schlosser writes tenderly about the origins of the anti-nuclear protest movement, noting how it began within deeply religious Catholic communities and he takes care to emphasise the human stories at the centre of the break-ins he writes about. He humanises people that are often dismissed as nuts or crazies, and shows how their concerns should be the concern of all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote at the start of this post, “Gods of Metal” is a thrilling read. Schlosser expertly weaves the narrative of the Y-12 interlopers into his potted history of nuclear weapons protests. It is taut, well-paced and informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had a copy of “Command and Control” for a year but haven’t had time to read more than the first chapter: that too reads like a thriller. Naturally I’ll write a review of that when I’m done reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime “Gods of Metal” is a perfect, if slightly chilling, read for your next train journey. At £1.99, it’d be cheap at twice the price.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Everything Everything, Get To Heaven</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/everything-everything-get-to-heaven"/>
   <updated>2015-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/everything-everything-get-to-heaven</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to write honestly about your feelings. It’s difficult to write about your feelings consistently, for a living on a regular basis. It’s difficult to write about your feelings when the world constantly intrudes with inanity, insanity and hatred. It’s difficult to write under those conditions without seeming frayed, without coming loose at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get To Heaven”, the third album by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everything-everything.co.uk&quot;&gt;Everything Everything&lt;/a&gt;, was forged under these stresses and pressures. For most of its running time it sounds like either a bomb ticking down to explode or like a clock inexorably counting up missed opportunities and stolen moments. It sounds for all the world as though it is trapped between fight and flight, paused between action and apathy. Yet it also subjects the listener to the yammerings of a culture that has driven itself mad. Depth and surface, glass and steel, truth and lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything Everything’s previous album “Arc” found their songcraft in a similarly precarious state of affairs. Ideas about love and existence were crammed into miniature epics that twisted and thrashed around like a handcuffed escape artist suspended high above some watery peril. For the most part - as on singles “Cough Cough” and “Duet” - the escapist act was not there to be seen: it was only the thrashing that mattered. A song of theirs would fishtail between subjects, between id and ego, between triumph and disaster. Only on “Undrowned” was the danger truly glimpsed (“There’s so much to talk about / that we don’t talk about”). A glum lullaby set in ice, the modern media merry-go-round cast into the very depths of Dante’s inferno - the winter chill of traitors, no flames here. It was, in retrospect, the marker lain for future trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get To Heaven” reveals the shark and its teeth rather than the plastic fin above the water. The stakes are raised and the danger is real. There’s no pretending that the world has not become darker and more dangerous in the years since “Arc” - but of course there’s that title, the lurid neon colours of the artwork, the ravey chords underpinning “Distant Past”: there’s optimism to be had here. It’s the joy that comes from persisting in spite of it all, the calm that comes from setting yourself aside from the madness around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must have been a difficult album to write. To take all that imagery of war and destruction, to take the ever-pervasive sense that those in power are screwing us all over, to take all the existential doubts that can exist within one person and how those doubts derail friendships and loves. To take it all and throw it into what initially sounds like the grimmest rave ever, and to shape it into something worth believing in. That must have been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that “Get To Heaven” is the best album that I’ve heard this year (not yet) but it’s certainly one of the more ambitious and interesting. Compared to how dull Foals have become (more on which soon) and &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-january-2013/&quot;&gt;just how much Everything Everything sounded like a second-rate Longpigs at points on “Arc”&lt;/a&gt;, it’s amazing that they’ve done this well. The production is sharp and bright, meaning that it contrasts with my go-to record for dark times - Radiohead’s “Amnesiac” - but then again it was always going to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that I’ve not described many of the songs. I’m not sure that I can write about them effectively this close to hearing them for the first time, not when they’ve affected me the way that they have. I urge you to check them out for yourself instead. As always, stay away from the bonus track version - nothing was ever gained by sticking six extra tracks that didn’t make the cut to your album playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject matter is probably among the darkest that pop music ever deals with, and yet somehow it still flickers to life and makes you feel invigorated and alive. That’s a very peculiar trick. You can’t expect an album to explain why bad things happen, but you can expect one to get you dancing regardless and “Get To Heaven” does just that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Inherent Vice: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/inherent-vice-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2015-07-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/inherent-vice-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight I finally caught up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_Vice_(film)&quot;&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inherent-Vice-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0099542161/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1437860132&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=inherent+vice&quot;&gt;Thomas Pynchon’s novel&lt;/a&gt;. It stars &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/&quot;&gt;Joaquin Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; as Larry ‘Doc’ Sportello who’s put on to a case of possible kidnapping by his “ex-old lady” Shasta, played by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/16/katherine-waterston-jk-rowlings-fantastic-beasts-harry-potter&quot;&gt;Katherine Waterston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no point attempting to tell much more you of the plot of Inherent Vice: it’s rather convoluted and self-digesting. At least this means there’s very little chance of stumbling into inadvertent spoilers. However, most of the plot strands do fall into place by the end, much more than I’d imagined they would half way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inherent Vice has a lot in common with other films that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/paul_thomas_anderson/&quot;&gt;Paul Thomas Anderson&lt;/a&gt; has directed that I’ve seen. In essence it’s about the failure of the American dream as much as There Will Be Blood is. Set in 1970, it plays out as the counterculture finds itself sold out, exploited and infiltrated by the very people that it set itself against. It’s as much about the difficulties in doing right by other human beings as Magnolia is. You get the impression that Doc is very much still in love with Shasta but that there are all manner of other complexities to his relationship. I imagine there are a fair few parallels with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-master-2012&quot;&gt;The Master&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/boogie-nights&quot;&gt;Boogie Nights&lt;/a&gt; too, but they’re both still on my To Watch list. I picked Inherent Vice because I fancied something a bit lighter to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was the first Paul Thomas Anderson movie that I found very funny. I think this all comes through from the Pynchon source, his novels are incredibly funny. Even though you might be completely lost after a few pages, it’s almost a given that those pages will make you laugh somehow. In Inherent Vice almost every character is comic and almost every situation is farcical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is it funny, Inherent Vice is also a beautiful movie. I’m not one of those people who can spot those odd mistakes like the wrong lamp-posts in a particular shot, but I was fooled the whole way through. And there’s something about the way it’s shot that really appeals to me. Part of it is that when people are having a conversation, a lot of the time (except when the plot requires it) the underlying shot is that of two people talking to one another. A nice example of where this really works is a scene where Doc chats to his lawyer (Sauncho Smilax - played by Benicio del Toro - very much channeling Fear and Loathing five years on) in a diner - when the waitress comes over Doc abruptly hushes Smilax almost as she comes into frame, heightening the tension and mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really liked the soundtrack. If you’re going to play Can over the opening credits, then I’m always going to be a big fan. As with “There Will Be Blood” the score is by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood but in fact the majority of the delights come from period pieces. There’s little doubt in my mind that the musical vignettes are also enhanced by the aforementioned superb cinematography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. I must admit he’s not how I’d imagined Doc when I read the novel but his mannerisms and speech are pretty much perfect. It’s a perfectly timed comic performance that really gets to heart of someone who knows everyone but knows nothing about what they’re doing. He does turn out to be a good detective and he does the right thing by the end. I think his performance is so good that I’ll probably get more out of re-reading the novel because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Joaquin Phoenix, there are also great performances from Owen Wilson as Coy Harlingen and from Josh Brolin as the police inspector ‘Bigfoot’ Bjornsen. The latter is great as a scenery chewing ‘straight’ cop with a weird home life. I also really enjoyed seeing Joanna Newsom as Sortilège, the sort of proto-narrator who also appears as a character. She gives a lovely sing-song cadence to her lines (understandable given that she’s a singer) and she does all the important work of pulling the movie together. (As in common with Pynchon, her name is a pun - Sortilege is the act of divination by lots, though her narration is mostly given in the form of astrological mumbo jumbo… another of Pynchon’s wonderful feints.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not an easy movie to understand but its pleasures are many, provided you can sit down and really watch it. I started while eating my dinner but ending up pausing it until I’d finished because it is hard at points to hear what the characters are saying, and with a plot this loopy it can problem if you miss something. That said I think the film is more lucid than the book, if only because it drives through the plot in its two hours twenty minutes. Sometimes a book, which takes longer to read, can unravel irrevocably given the chance - Anderson’s adaptation is quite disciplined and does not allow the plot too many opportunities to get away from the viewer. With the novel, lots of Pynchon’s asides and in-jokes draw attention away from the matter in hand - and some of them are visual, so they’re better served by the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, read the book the first. If you enjoyed the book, you’ll love this. And even if you didn’t, you might still like this if you love Magnolia (a little less harebrained) or There Will Be Blood (though this is mostly lighter). Failing that, go dig out the soundtrack - you’ll thank me for that at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous appearances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/on-pynchon/&quot;&gt;Thomas Pynchon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/can-the-lost-tapes/&quot;&gt;CAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trivia: Inherent Vice is a legal term for something contains its own source of destruction, like eggs breaking. It’s used particularly in situations of high risk, often something cannot be insured because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #31: The White Room by The KLF</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-31"/>
   <updated>2015-07-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-31</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This little masterpiece was released in 1991. I got my copy on cassette for Christmas that year, but by May in 1992 they’d already “retired” and split up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KLF were a band in the right place at the right time with the right idea. Taking advantage of synthesizers and the idea of fusing rock and pop music with the emerging sound of house music, they laid the ground for many of the most successful electronic acts that followed them. They were also master showmen, taking a whole host of crazy conspiracy theories and smooshing them together in one stadium-sized package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The White Room” will be a quarter of a century old in 2016. It is a sort of Stonehenge of modern dance music: mysterious, totemic, and completely unique to the minds that conceived it. There are nine tracks and the whole thing’s over and done in forty-five minutes, yet there’s plenty of space and groove with two tracks making it past your standard 12” running time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-is-radio-freedom&quot;&gt;This is Radio Freedom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album begins with “What Time Is Love?” - the perfect example of their singles formula - a burbling synth line and just the right samples. At first I though the “mu mu” line (more on its meaning later) was “roll roll”. Of course it’s the “I wanna make you sweat” line made it an essential addition to early classics like Lil’ Louis’s “French Kiss” (a record that I cued up seven times in a row on a jukebox when I was 12) and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, “Make It Rain” is probably the great lost KLF single - it’s rumoured that this is what they were working on when they started to lose faith in the project - a laid back groove and a cool sax line that may or may not actually be a synth. As a teenager I was convinced that I could actually make it rain by singing fragments of this song (yes I was rather odd when I was younger).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“3AM Eternal” and “Last Train To Trancentral” show the other great idea that The KLF hit upon in 1990 and 1991: to take rap and hip-hop music and insert it into that dance-pop hybrid. This inspired all sorts of nonsense, like 2 Unlimited and such, but let’s not worry about that. Listening to it now, it’s much clearer how much of a debt that “3AM Eternal” owes to tracks like “Planet Rock” by Afrika Bambaataa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album version of “Last Train To Trancentral” is longer and mellower than the single version, with the american version of the album preferring this version. Though The KLF’s back catalogue was deleted in 1992, the US version of the album is still available. It’s a much weaker version as it has no crowd noise samples - on the UK version the whole of side A plays out like a concert with cheering and PA announcements between songs - and the shorter version of “Last Train”, while energetic, is rather abrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-into-the-white-room&quot;&gt;Step Into The White Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weird brilliance of “The White Room” as an album is that it actually feels like a single. You have that continuous twenty minutes of music on side A with three UK Top 10 singles (and a number one) sequenced like the best concert ever and the side B plays out like a cooler mellower shadow of that first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Build A Fire” is a sleepy travelogue song built on crickets, synths and pedal steel that channels their other album “Chill Out”. It also indulges Bill Drummond’s songwriting skills and his Scottish accent comes as a bit of a surprise at this point in the album. It may not have the machine guns of “3AM Eternal” or the grind of “What Time Is Love?” but as a song “Build A Fire” is as much part of the KLF legend as the more lauded ones. (Rumour has it that a radically reworked version would also have appeared on that lost “Make It Rain” single.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title track of “The White Room” is genuinely odd - scat singing over a proto-drum’n’bass beat with female backing vocals and a spoken word lyric from Drummond. It’s also got that synthy-sounding sax from “Make It Rain” again. It has the feel of a track that’s an experiment and it’s pretty successful, proof that they probably had plenty left in the tank when they called it quits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two tracks develop the mythology of Drummond and Cauty’s shadowy alter-band The Justified Ancients Of Mu Mu. “No More Tears” stretches out long and lazy over nine and a half minutes. To the twelve-year-old me this song felt like lazy filler but over the years I’ve grown to appreciate all the little elements within it - there’s even a bit of melodica and a dub feel to some of it. Mostly though it is the track that speaks loudest to The KLF’s plan to create a movie of “The White Room” to accompany the album. By all accounts it was to be a road movie and I imagine “No More Tears” would sound great soundtracking a long stretch of movie where nothing much happens - it certainly did when I listened to it on the truck one day on the way down to Patagonia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Justified and Ancient” was famously re-tooled into a weird techno-country single featuring Tammy Wynette - another of those moments where Drummond and Cauty found that the best way to make things happen was simply to do it. This attitude was first espoused in their book “The Manual: How To Have A Number One The Easy Way”, a tome that has been consulted by many artists since. It may have incurred the wrath of ABBA (The first Justified Ancients of Mu Mu album had to be deleted and all copies destroyed because of uncleared samples of “Dancing Queen”) but here it created another top 5 single for “The White Room” and went a long way to earning them their Brit Award for Best Group in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Room version (the B-side to the single) is much mellower and ends with desolate winds - appropriate for a side of music that begins with the chirp of crickets. Black Steel’s delivery of the lyrics (the closest to an outlining of The KLF philosophy in one of their songs) is suitably wistful, though it could never match the Tammy Wynette version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-they-did-next&quot;&gt;What They Did Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, they released a single called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Grim_Up_North&quot;&gt;“It’s Grim Up North”&lt;/a&gt; that listed northern towns and included samples of 808 State’s “Cubik” and recordings of “Jerusalem”. The song even caused questions to be raised in the House of Commons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They returned to “What Time Is Love?” with a hair metal version called “America: What Time Is Love?” that put forth theory that it was in fact the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu who discovered America a thousand years before Columbus. It’s amazing, especially the 12” version. It has an operatic middle 8.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, even better is the B-side “America No More”, which compares the then nascent First Gulf War to the Vietnam War by mixing up samples from both time frames alongside bagpipes. Like all the best moments from their back catalogue, it shouldn’t work but somehow it just does.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.how-soon.com/index.php/blog/entry/jimmy_cauty_on_the_aftermath_of_the_klf_the_start_of_the_k_foundation/&quot;&gt;Brit Awards&lt;/a&gt; the band collaborated with death metal band Extreme Noise Terror to perform a thrash metal version of “3AM Eternal” before firing blanks from a machine gun. The performance shocked the audience (and me watching at home) with the announcer declaring “The KLF have left the music industry”. And they had.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dangerousminds.net/comments/watch_the_k_foundation_burn_a_million_quid&quot;&gt;They burnt a million quid.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They haven’t reformed. Not properly. Not yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UPDATE 2017: They might have reformed!&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Untitled 2</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/untitled-2"/>
   <updated>2015-07-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/untitled-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago &lt;a href=&quot;/jackson-x/&quot;&gt;I wrote about an idea for a novel that I’d abandoned&lt;/a&gt;. I mentioned in that post that I’d abandoned it because there was another idea that I wanted to pursue. The working title for it is “Untitled 2”. (It isn’t really, I have an actual working title that would give things away or would at least make me feel like the idea was out in the world.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent days I’ve mulled over various post ideas and one idea was to write a big reveal of my vision for “Untitled 2”. I could set out what the novel would be about, the ideas it would grapple with, and when and where it would be set. Stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I realised that just as with &lt;a href=&quot;/jackson-x/&quot;&gt;Jackson X&lt;/a&gt; and the Summer of the Space Whale, this would mean letting go of the project entirely - because if I let the cat out of the bag, I won’t be able to write the novel I dream about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I realised that I wanted to write this post in order to try to set out the idea. It’s hard enough to write a blog regularly as the long gaps between posts here are testament too. I don’t think I could hammer out eight hundred words a day as well. (Though I guess I won’t know unless I try.) And it’s not as if that’s the only difficulty, at least with a blog I can flit from one topic to another. With a novel I’d have to shape it and make it coherent. Lots of editing would be involved. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do need to work through the principal ideas and see whether they’re worth focussing on. I can see the benefits of at least trying to flesh out the ideas. There are aspects of the novel that I don’t feel confident that I can write. As a result it might be useful to resist my urge to tell you what it’s about and focus instead on producing posts to experiment and maybe develop that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, “Untitled 2” doesn’t have to be a fantastic novel, it just has to be mine. At least now I can sketch out the shape of the piece and try to set myself those confidence boosting tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was a day recently where I did sit and turn “The Summer of the Space Whale” into a more full-blown treatment. It ended up pretty complex. This pleased me because I did worry that it was an over-simple idea and that it couldn’t be written into a “proper novel”. That’s something that’s also been a worry for me when I’ve though about “Untitled 2” but hopefully it will be similarly amenable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Light, Last Light</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/first-light-last-light"/>
   <updated>2015-07-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/first-light-last-light</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I often ponder whether the joys of waking up early are greater than those of staying up late. Empirical evidence seems to bear this out: all those people who get to work before you do, super-eager to get everything done. But then all the people walking under your windows late at night, drunk and laughing, they sound like they’re having a whale of a time too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I oscillate between the two extremes, though I tend to sleep better if I stay up late. My natural sleep hours are 1am to 8am, though I am usually human if I can get up just after 7. Whenever I try to stick to getting up early, to do masochistic things like running or being organised, I often find it harder to get to sleep or I wake up at 3 rather than 6. I end up second guessing my alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now structure my life in a routine without routine, where I try to stick to both approaches at once. Because my early bedtime is 10 and my late bedtime is three hours later (gasps from the balcony!), I now plan my evenings to do something different after 10 o’clock. I stop watching TV or playing Civ, and start drafting a post or tinkering with existing ones. (As much as I love writing new posts, I do like to smarten up old posts as well…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time I don’t make it till one, which is ok because you can leave things like reading and blogging until the next day if need be. I always sleep better if I end up with the book I’m reading tapping me on the nose. There’s also no better remedy for insomnia than to finish a piece of writing, particularly if it’s about something you’ve had on your mind all day. I’m also far less of a night owl outside the house, I need to be somewhere I can micronap even if I’ve burning the midnight oil: loud places and alcohol bore me, they’re often effective sedatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I don’t like the middle ground. A crisp cool early morning run with no one around is a delight. That slowness of the night as it drags the departing day into dreams that drift across the silence of suburban streets, that has its own majesty. Each is preferable to the miserable clamour of the day itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it doesn’t matter which way you go. You have to split the difference between the virtuous hard-worker who gets up with the larks and the creative soul who likes to wring every last tick and tock from the day’s long clock. You might even settle for what I cannot: the median. The roles and stereotypes about when you rise and fall are cultural, which mean that they are merely methods for persons uncaring and unknown to take power over your choices, your life. Don’t let them. Stay up awhile. Bed yourself down right now to be up with the dawn. Whichever choice it is, make it the one that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Minions: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/minions-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2015-07-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/minions-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Minions got their own movie, just as I predicted in &lt;a href=&quot;/despicable-me-2-a-short-review/&quot;&gt;my review of Despicable Me 2&lt;/a&gt;. I went to see it this week and I enjoyed it a lot. Here’s a short review. Don’t worry, there are no spoilers here that aren’t in the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very funny. Right from the opening credits you get the minions and their anarchic fun-loving slapstick humour. There’s always been something delightful about they way in which they innocently bumble around. Their penchant for evil bosses is inexplicable but incredibly amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing deeply philosophical about a minion. They just enjoy being part of the herd and live joyously in the moment. I guess we should all try to be like them, at least from the happiness point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot is serviceable enough. Like the trailer, the film is narrated throughout which helps to shape things. I love the fact that for large sections the minions just babble away in their own language (a sort of bowdlerised French to my ears) and you’re effectively watching a foreign film without the subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no big twists just hilarious moments of deus ex machina that are heavily signposted, often to comic effect. This is fine for a fairly silly film that slips in outrageous ideas at every opportunity. I think I gasped with laughter at a couple of bits just because it was so silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Minions can’t quite keep up with itself. Very few of the non-minion characters stand out, which is understandable but also a little disappointing. I think the Despicable Me films are better than Minions because there are other strong characters like Gru and the girls. All minions all the time does seem to be too much of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that slapstick cannot sustain an entire movie so there are moments when Minions has to slow down just to let something else happen on-screen. Yet there are also other moments where there isn’t enough slapstick, that the movie plays it too safe. I won’t tell you what those are, as spoilers would be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really strains against its U certificate. In the trailer you see the minions working for Dracula and in the cinema I heard a young child ask his parents “Who’s that?” How do you explain who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula&quot;&gt;Count Dracula&lt;/a&gt; is to a four-year old?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are chase sequences that go to extraordinary lengths to avoid the level of violence you’d probably see in “normal” movies. They end up funnier as result, but there are also moments that gloss over extreme violence involving guns, axes, knives and explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also uncomfortable with a scene involving a torture chamber, in particular a noose. Call me a prude if you like but I don’t think a gallows has any place in a U certificate movie. A PG certificate would hardly be a disaster anyway, it’s a nice minion-friendly yellow. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/minions-film-0#bbfcinsight&quot;&gt;The BBFC judgement&lt;/a&gt; states “There is a comic scene in which a man threatens to torture the minions in his medieval style torture chamber. The minions are stretched on a rack and hung on a noose but neither of these things harm the minions at all.” Well that’s alright then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong though. After all, I didn’t mind that I’d spotted an Alien reference in Despicable Me 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I enjoyed Minions a lot but I think I liked Despicable Me 2 a bit more. I might benefit from seeing it again (I did miss the scene after the end of the credits after all). The good news is that there is going to be a third Despicable Me movie and I expect that the minions will make it into a few other movies too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Initial Comparison of Apple Music and Spotify</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/an-initial-comparison-of-apple-music-and-spotify"/>
   <updated>2015-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/an-initial-comparison-of-apple-music-and-spotify</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;/why-apple-music-feels-like-a-fail/&quot;&gt;previous post about Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; was more a response to how it was presented at the WWDC Keynote rather than to the idea of Apple Music itself. I should have known better than to use that clickbait title. I knew I wasn’t writing about the product, more the flatness of its introduction (despite the names on show).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days of living with it I thought I’d write about it and Spotify, so that it’s not just my snarky comments about the keynote that are on record here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signed up for the three-month trial. (I also made sure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/article/2942713/how-to-stop-apple-music-from-automatically-renewing-your-membership.html&quot;&gt;cancel auto-renewal&lt;/a&gt;.) I’ve not cancelled my Spotify subscription because I feel it’s better to evaluate them both side by side. I figure one way to tell whether the new service is better is to note whether I reach for Apple Music over Spotify more often as the trial continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some brief observations so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Music playlists are pretty good.&lt;/strong&gt; Both Apple and Spotify provide what I call situational playlists - sequences of songs suited to the time of day - though Apple’s are more vague. Also the “For You” tab on Apple Music (roughly equivalent to Spotify’s “Now” tab) is presented more as a feed that updates over time. At the moment I can still scroll down to the very first batch of suggestions Apple gave me. Meanwhile Spotify will work out what part of my day it is (i.e. commute, lunchtime, bedtime etc) and suggest appropriate playlists. I love the bedtime ones that feature jungle noises and rain! Apple’s big plus in terms of playlists are the genre and artist centred ones. These are very good, especially the artist ones, built as they are on iTunes long neglected (but actually pretty good) Genius feature.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify indicates which songs and albums you have saved to your device more clearly than Apple Music.&lt;/strong&gt; This is important to me because I don’t always have a very consistent signal as I walk through town. I will test this more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the main draws of Apple Music for me is &lt;strong&gt;AirPlay integration&lt;/strong&gt;. However this is better in Spotify than it used to be. With Spotify it’s even possible to play control music playing on my PS3 from my mac, which is nice for combining gaming and music.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve never been much in love with Spotify’s &lt;em&gt;UI&lt;/em&gt; but their iOS app has improved a lot in recent weeks and Apple Music on iPhone seems a bit fiddly by comparison (perhaps it’s better with a 6+ than a 5S). On the Mac though the integration of Apple Music into iTunes makes a lot of sense to me and is pretty fun to use. I enjoy Apple Music much more on the Mac than on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My gut feeling is that &lt;strong&gt;Spotify makes it easier to discover new music, while Apple Music seems to me to have a good grasp of the music I already like&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything I listen to on Spotify scrobbles.&lt;/strong&gt; With Apple Music only the music I listen to on the laptop scrobbles. There is an iOS app from last.fm called iScrobbler but it seems to be so far behind the times that I don’t think it would work any more, certainly not with the streamed stuff. I like the idea of having a record of what I listen to and have used Last.fm for many years, so it’d be a shame to let it go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I think &lt;strong&gt;the radio station is ok&lt;/strong&gt; though I’ve only listened to it for a little while out of idle curiosity. I imagine radio, with its occasional interruptions from the presenter and its meander through genres to please all tastes, is a good way to humanise the playlists. Apple claims its playlists are picked by humans but even so a playlist is a fixed set of particular songs. Radio is another way to surface music for people in a dynamic fashion. To my ears Beats One is so scattershot (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/2/8883215/beats-1-radio-apple-music-zane-lowe-first-24&quot;&gt;Reviews back this up too&lt;/a&gt;) that it could also address the issue of how Apple Music gets me to listen to new stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I switched off Connect as soon as I could&lt;/strong&gt;, it doesn’t appeal to me at all. Neither did MySpace back in the day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnet.com/how-to/replace-the-connect-tab-with-playlists-in-music-on-ios-8-4/&quot;&gt;You can replace the tab with one that features your own playlists&lt;/a&gt;, a nice touch as iCloud playlist syncing is one of the best features of iTunes Match.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neither Spotify nor Apple Music can play my vinyl.&lt;/strong&gt; However Apple Music does let me stream two of the three bonus tracks on the recent Orb album.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Apple Music has impressed me - it was always going to be a case of using it rather than believing the hype - but there are things for Apple to iron out and Spotify does have significant mind share with me. I will write another update in September shortly before the trial ends.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To reboot this series, Album Digest June 2015 features five fantastic albums from Hot Chip, Jamie xx, Blanck Mass, Holly Herndon, and The Orb. I could pick loads more as I’ve listened to a lot of albums since &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-february-2015/&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; but I decided to focus on the more electronic material. This means that I have no excuses for not continuing next month with a rockier theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hot-chip-why-make-sense&quot;&gt;Hot Chip “Why Make Sense?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot Chip seem to be settling in to a pattern with their album releases, alternating between messy experimental affairs and then a state of the art correction. Witness how “The Warning” smartened up the all-over-the-place “Coming On Strong” and how “One Life Stand” moulded and matured the lovestruck meandering of “Made In The Dark” into a lithe ten song set. “Why Make Sense?” takes the earnest song-based approach of “In Our Heads” and casts it into a funky fun-filled fifty minutes. It’s as concise as they’ve been since “One Life Stand”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual there are bangers, songs that would happily sit on any of their albums. “Huarache Lights” is a pean to machine intelligence, the line “replace us with the things that do the job better” repeated by a vocoder that gradually melts into an incomprehensible babble. “Love Is The Future” is a sweet love song that takes on the tweeness of “Look At Where We Are” and re-tools into a bouncy pop song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think “Easy To Get” is probably as coy and sexy as Hot Chip have been since “Made In The Dark”. It’s pretty direct about playing easy to get: “You need a coat, something to take off”. Meanwhile there’s a lovely little synth line that filigrees the chorus that makes it feel like a song you’ve known for years. It’s lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tracks like “Need You Now” and the title track aim squarely for the dance floor. The former is built around a lovely sample of an old school house vocal (sorry, I’m not knowledgeable enough to say what it is), giving it a ready-made classic feel. It also features the much underused vocal talents of Al Doyle. The title track has provided some consolation since the disastrous result of the election with its killer line: “Be what you are / at the mercy of your rulers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot Chip are UK dance music’s Radiohead. They get on with the job without too much fuss and constantly turn out excellent albums. I wonder what their “Kid A” would sound like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jamie-xx-in-colour&quot;&gt;Jamie xx “In Colour”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to like The XX much more than I do. I love their remixes but their original albums not so much. I admire their spare approach to arrangements and their monochrome artwork, but over the course of a whole album their music tends to leave me cold. Songs that are amazing in isolation, like “VCR” or “Angels”, just don’t come together well at anything over EP length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Colour” is very much the remedy to that, the colour wheels of the artwork seem very apt. Like anyone trapped in a corner by a restrictive aesthetic, Jamie xx has done the sensible thing and started all over again. This is album is a colourful (there I said it) explosion feel good nostalgic dance music. Stand out tracks include “Gosh”, “Seesaw” and “The Rest Is Noise”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gosh” takes the rattling brittle rhythms of UK drum’n’bass and moulds it into a warm vibrant opening track. It’s all homage and you can feel the love seeping out your speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seesaw” shows that with more emphasis on beats and less on introspection, The Xx could be a phenomenal band - in fact this plays more like a remix of one of their songs than a song proper. Remy’s detached vocal works well as a vague snippet, while a more extended contribution later on (“Loud Places”) gives the album a much-needed breather and its emotional heart (“I go to loud places / to find someone to be quiet with”). Another collaboration with Oliver, the other member of The XX, is less successful but at least it is short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea whether “The Rest Is Noise” is inspired by Alex Ross’s excellent book of the same name. I think I’d expect more neo-classical wonkiness over the album as a whole if it were. The track itself begins with a minimal beat that initially sounds like it is sticking but eventually emerges into an emotional heartbeat. It is beautifully affecting instrumental music, the sort of thing you’d like to watch the sun come up to. It pulls a lovely feint with a deep bass line toward the end too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole, “In Colour” reminds me a lot of Four Tet’s “Beautiful Rewind” album, which took a similar nostalgic approach and produced a kinetic album that emphatically endorsed an older form of dance music whilst still sounding fresh and new. I wonder if this more expansive approach could also be applied to music by The XX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blanck-mass-dumb-flesh&quot;&gt;Blanck Mass “Dumb Flesh”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blanck Mass is the pseudonym of Benjamin John Power, one half of minimalist noiseniks Fuck Buttons. “Dumb Flesh” is his second album under this alias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “In Colour” is a euphoric celebration of dance music past, then “Dumb Flesh” could be thought of as a darker trip into its future. Not that this album is entirely ascetic, it also has a knack for hitting the savvy music fan’s pleasure points. Take the opener “Loam” which slurs into your headphones with distorted voice samples but ends up becoming a frenetic gated jam by the end of its four minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dumb Flesh” is front loaded with possibly the best dance tune of the year, “Dead Format”. It’s a glowering colossus, a banger that does all that button pushing I mentioned. There’s a proper build in it and the main riff is a distorted female vocal that’s pulled from pillar to post (or more accurately, around and through your ears like some sort of brain floss). It certainly demonstrates a novel way of getting around sample clearance: mangle your vocals beyond recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that things are more subdued. The ten minutes of “No Lite” sound like a softer Fuck Buttons track - which isn’t to say it isn’t relentless and minimal, just that the average Fuck Buttons track is pretty heavy. There are also more elements at play here than on a typical Fuck Buttons tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cruel Sport” almost has a chorus. About three-quarters of the way through it sounds like a sampler has gained sentience and is trying to rap, all over a beat that’s about twice the size of your house. It’s epic, almost as good as “Dead Format”. There won’t be many albums out this year with two tracks as good as “Dead Format” and “Cruel Sport”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album is good but doesn’t quite match up to the highlights. It’s a perfectly serviceable listen but I get the impression that I’ll end up putting those two great tracks on a playlist and then forgetting about the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;holly-herndon-platform&quot;&gt;Holly Herndon “Platform”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an album that could teach robots to love. It’s excellent. It features pretty much every element I love about dance music and presents it to your with fresh ears. If you bother to listen to just one of my recommendations this month, make it this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holly is a musician and sound artist, and her compositions on “Platform” skip along that boundary between recognisable music and something other, something we might instead choose to call art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At points it makes me think of &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-october-2012/&quot;&gt;Laurie Spiegel’s experiments in how to create electronic music in the first place&lt;/a&gt;, the experiments of Glass, Reich, and others in making a modern classical music, and then the simple visceral pleasures of techno’s throbs and thuds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere there are tracks that make me think of Prince, James Blake, Grimes, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Anderson&quot;&gt;Laurie Andersen&lt;/a&gt;. Most of it though just sounds utterly unique: all those comparisons are just me clutching at straws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take “Chorus”, it’s propelled along by a throbbing beat and yet dominated by sampled voices. It’s so precise and full of so many small detailed elements that it is impossible to describe in its totality. Of course its idiosyncrasy and defiance of description does not detract one iota from the very real pleasure of listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the thing is things just get weirder and weirder from there. “Unequal” takes what sounds a bit like a medieval plainsong and then wraps it around a barely there beat, before folding in the sounds of running water, bird wings, and samples of poetry. For some people it’s not going to make any sense at all but for the open-minded it is genuinely mind expanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Morning Sun” uses a similar formula and is perhaps the most recognisable pop song on the record. It also has a cool video of her walking around on Mars alone, evoking “The Martian”. And again, it’s not just the fact that it sounds so incredible as a whole (and &lt;em&gt;like a pop song&lt;/em&gt; despite of everything that’s in there) but that there is so much internal detail. Not only that, but that it can sound logical despite all the tangents and interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite though is “Locker Leak”, which is part sung, part spoken, and all crazy. It’s full of tongue twisters, puns, and advertising slogans. There’s also a killer beat underpinning it all. I think it says a lot about the crazy mixed up world we live in: a maelström of small snippets that make sense on their own but sound surreal (and a little frightening) when all whipped together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Even if you end up hating it, you need to check out this album at least once on your preferred streaming service. (It might be better if you give it more than one try, it does take some getting used to but it’s definitely worth the effort.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-orb-moonbuilding-2703-ad&quot;&gt;The Orb “Moonbuilding 2703 AD”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Moonbuilding 2703 AD” is the tenth Orb album since the future (i.e. the year 2000) arrived, though it feels like the first true Orb album since Orblivion. Despite “History of the Future 2” doing a great job of rehabilitating their more recent material (in my mind at least), it is a genuine relief to hear a classic sounding Orb album again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the familiar sound of the album comes from two things. First, it’s just Alex and Thom, which means it’s two-thirds of the classic line-up responsible for most of “U.F.Orb” and “Orbus Terrarum”. Second, the tracks are about thirteen minutes long on average - something we’ve not seen on an Orb album for quite a while. It’s just a shame that there are only four tracks - though this does make for an easier review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansive run times of the tracks and the spacey material makes for a genuinely relaxing album. I don’t think it’s a crime for ambient music to lull you into a sleepy state, that’s pretty much what I listen to it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“God’s Mirrorball” marries the sound of the last Alex and Thom only collaboration “Okie Dokie It’s The Orb On Kompakt” - this album is released on Germany’s Kompakt records too - with the gently undulating rhythms of classic tracks like “Blue Room” and “Valley”. There’s also something really quite modern about the sound of it too, something that I can’t quite put my finger on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Moon Scapes 2703 BC” has a nice cavernous beat and is more reminiscent of “Baghdad Batteries”style material, but also the harder tracks on “U.F.Orb” like “Close Encounter”. In fact, by about halfway it’s splitting the difference between those long mixes of “Assassin”, “Majestic”, and the trippy alternate takes of “Plateau” you find floating about on various rarity compilations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lunar Caves” is the shortest track. It’s quite dark and it doesn’t really manage to come together into anything in particular. In the context of the four tracks here, it’s fine - the long meandering line between B and D on the track listing. (Actually it reminds me a lot of the really long mixes of tracks from “Orblivion” that were included with the reissue - I think that’s the last time we got tracks this length from The Orb.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the title track is uncharacteristically funky, which isn’t to say it isn’t welcome: it’s certainly nice to hear a new take on their sound alongside all the nostalgia. It has a kind of hip-hop vibe. This might not seem to make much sense but given how successful The Orb were at taking house music into space, why not have another go with another genre. It would certainly be interesting to hear some rapping over this - though maybe not all fourteen minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a solid addition to their later discography, it certainly bodes well for “History of the Future 3”. The sad thing though is that in their heyday, The Orb would have released this much material in one of their singles. For example, the combined length of the “Assassin” EP can’t be much shorter than “Moonbuilding 2703 AD” and the diversity of the mixes was not dissimilar to the variations between the tracks here. Ah, the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I have the triple vinyl and there are three bonus tracks that I have not been able to listen to yet. I will report on these later once I have a turntable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time Is Time and That Is That</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/time-is-time-and-that-is-that"/>
   <updated>2015-06-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/time-is-time-and-that-is-that</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A brief rant about Facebook: I hate the fact that the news feed defaults to “Top Stories” even though I change it back to “Most Recent” every time I log in. It’s a horrible pattern of user abuse that needs to stop. Time is time and that is that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why does Facebook feel the need to jiggle things about into a random order? Well most of you have that mobile phone app of theirs that sucks your battery and your data allowance like crazy (mainly by auto-playing videos like a dick). They know you’re checking your Facebook on the loo at work and that that limits your interaction time. During this precious interlude they want you to see the stuff that they think interests you and the things that other people paid for you to see. You’re going to see some hick’s new tattoo, at least one photo of someone else’s child and an advert telling you to vote Conservative - whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behaviour is spreading. Twitter is trying it too. They’ve introduced a “while you were away” doodad that completely undermines the point of Twitter. Twitter exists to disseminate short, disposable, time-sensitive information in public. The “while you were away” feature is a bit like watching week old episodes of the ten o’clock news on iPlayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if newspapers suppressed recent events in order to tell you who to vote for and distract you with idle gossip about celebrities that history will wash away like sandcastles on a beach. Oh they already exist and they’re all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if your mobile provider decided to send your texts to you in the wrong order for reasons that suited their business model. You get a message from your spouse asking you to pick them up from work ten hours late: No wonder they’re sitting in bed next to you silently fuming and won’t talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Obviously some mobile phone networks - like, for instance, Three in Chichester - are running an experimental version of this kind of service. I doubt that it will catch on, despite its evident value in avoiding calls from recruiters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are real-time messaging apps that can’t mess around with the chronology of events. Facebook has one - and owns the other one that most people use. Meanwhile Facebook also owns Instagram which, for the time being, doesn’t muck around with user timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of video streaming apps like Twitch (for video games) and Periscope or Meerkat (for showing people the inside of your fridge) might help to set things right. You can’t disrupt a live stream without annoying the viewer, you’d have to do what YouTube is doing more often and that’s showing ads ahead of videos. Mind you, that’s annoying enough as it is. Time marches forward, it’s too precious to spend changing news feed setting and watching damned adverts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found “Learn X in Y minutes” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://learnxinyminutes.com&quot;&gt;www.learnxinyminutes.com&lt;/a&gt;) while researching the programming languages needed for a new project. The site aims to help people who know at least one programming language to learn others by proving a quick run through of the main language features. It’s not quite enough to get you up and running. After all, having sample code doesn’t get you the compiler. However, it’s a nice start that shows you how similar (and different) language X is compared to the one(s) you already know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jim's Conservatory</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/jims-conservatory"/>
   <updated>2015-05-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/jims-conservatory</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that Jim has just had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_Kingdom_bank_rescue_package&quot;&gt;sudden unexpected expenditure&lt;/a&gt;: a neighbour released a bull into his back garden and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/01/creditcrunch.subprimecrisis&quot;&gt;it destroyed his conservatory&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s assume that the conservatory is essential to Jim’s wellbeing, so it has to be fixed immediately. As a result Jim’s debts, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/03/senior-tory-financial-crash-was-purely-a-banking-crisis-not-labour-overspend&quot;&gt;were previously small and well-managed&lt;/a&gt;, have now increased somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously Jim can’t keep that debt hanging over him forever. What does he do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Jim, the circumstances of his borrowing aren’t so different before and after the event. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/interest-rates/9922941/Interest-rates-predictions-Four-more-years-of-0.5.html&quot;&gt;Interest rates are low and are predicted to stay low&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21554311&quot;&gt;terms of his credit haven’t changed a great deal despite his increased borrowing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Jim is lucky enough that his creditors won’t be too panicked even if he borrows twice as much as he is now. (If you think this unrealistic, think of it as the bank betting that the more Jim borrows the more likely he is to have a balance that they can charge him interest on when interest rates do rise.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim has an income that was comfortably managing to pay his debts but now his debt payments are taking up a greater fraction of his income - to the point where his agreed repayments and essential costs combine to generate more debt. First, Jim can make some savings to account for this. However, he can’t eliminate all his spending or else he spoils his income (for example: he cannot earn if starving and will not be paid if he does not take the train to be present at work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally we assume that Jim can’t simply default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll assume that Jim is already in an optimal and legal tax situation, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/08/hsbc-files-expose-swiss-bank-clients-dodge-taxes-hide-millions&quot;&gt;he can’t earn more simply by withholding it from others who are due&lt;/a&gt; - after all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.demos.org/data-byte/federal-revenue-lost-tax-evasion&quot;&gt;this is little more than default by another name&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim’s best chance at paying off the debt is to increase his income. He’d &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/britain-feasting-on-credit-crunch-hit-2016&quot;&gt;better do it sooner rather than later&lt;/a&gt;, as he has little idea of which way the economy will turn. He has some options for quick wins - he considers withdrawing from his pension scheme until the debt is paid. He could also &lt;a href=&quot;http://scraptrident.org&quot;&gt;cancel his home insurance&lt;/a&gt; (at least for a little while). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/15/voters-tax-fund-nhs-poll&quot;&gt;He can ask for a raise&lt;/a&gt; but not for too much or he’ll simply be out on his ear and earning nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing Jim can do is to develop his current skills and adapt to new job opportunities in the hope of securing a better income. If he does this then chances are he will be in a stronger position after the debts are paid, he’ll be able to live comfortably, and start to build up a fund against future emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim is looking at a few years of not being able to get the latest iPad, cover himself in ridiculously ugly tattoos, or go out on the lash with his mates. He thinks this might not be a bad thing. His experiences of researching the evidence base for the most effective ways to sustainably increase his income has left him way of short term fixes to long term problems.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Like a Rhino Voting for Poaching</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/like-a-rhino-voting-for-poaching"/>
   <updated>2015-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/like-a-rhino-voting-for-poaching</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason I cannot and will not vote Conservative, and like most people’s apparent motive for voting tory it is also a selfish one. As someone employed in the public sector, working to ensure the greater good, I’m a member of an increasingly endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah Matthew, I hear you say, you’re trotting out the old “the turkeys have voted for Christmas” line. Well no, like I said, this is purely selfish. When you mark that X in the box, you tend to think about yourself only. Never mind the turkeys (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rhino analogy is apt, you see. The conservatives are not shy about their ideological pursuit of a small state. They want as little paid for by taxpayers as possible, the functions of our community solidarity provided by unaccountable private companies. They are the poachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a poacher, the hunting of a rhino has a logic that cannot be seen by the outsider. There’s a value to the kill that blinkers the poacher, makes them unable to see the wider ramifications of their blood lust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are big game hunters. After the last election the Conservative-led coalition published a list of every public servant paid over £100,000 - their list of the trophies they were going after. Several people working in the organisation I worked for at the time were on that list. I didn’t begrudge them their salaries. I thought they were by-and-large worth it. It made me aspirational; after all, that’s what big salaries in the private sector are supposed to do aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead the Tories made an argument not dissimilar to that made by the most deluded of poachers - something along the line that by keeping the number of rhinos down, poaching somehow benefits the rhinos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conservatives argue that a talented worker in the public sector should have no trouble finding work in the private sector. There are captive rhinos too. Traded between zoos (private companies) with their reproduction rate kept low so as to preserve their value. The poachers might point to these rhinos and say “what’s the problem, it’s not as if they’re extinct?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so that’s my “selfish”, slightly egocentric reason for why I couldn’t vote Conservative. I like being a rhino. I’m a pretty good rhino. I’m aware that as an analogy it contains its own ideology. I think that ideology needs to be communicated, debated, and refined, perhaps in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I may be worrying about nothing, that my job might be safe. But there are plenty of people out there whose jobs are not safe now, or who have jobs that will get more stressful, or less secure. I feel their worries as though they are my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also aware that there are other reasons for voting and plenty of room for discussion about what the alternative to the conservatives should be. As you can imagine, I’ve thought about that a lot in recent weeks. It’s just a matter of getting it all down so that it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #30: Our Aim Is to Satisfy by Red Snapper</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-30"/>
   <updated>2015-04-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-30</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The thirtieth understated classic is by a band named after a fish. There isn’t a great deal for me to say about “Our Aim Is To Satisfy”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; apart from the usual insistence that it is quite good. There’s no overarching theme to write about, and no deep personal story attached. It was bound to happen eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our Aim Is To Satisfy” is one of those albums spawned in the late nineties and early naughties at the height of the Electronica boom: dance music that you didn’t necessarily have to dance to. It’s not quite chill out music but nor is it song-based (for the most part) - it’s mainly instrumental electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What set Red Snapper apart was an insistence on live percussion. This must have made them quite a compelling proposition live, which must be why the ended up supporting The Prodigy during their tours of “The Fat of The Land”. On record I’m not sure that it translates the same way - many of the drum tracks and bass lines are chopped up, messed up, and mucked around with, so I’m not sure how to interpret their “liveness”. Perhaps it explains why “Our Aim Is To Satisfy” is so darn funky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to trawl through the track list the way I usually do. As I said, there’s no central theme - “Our Aim Is To Satisfy” is just a bunch of tracks really. Some of it sags in the middle and some of it misfires altogether in fact, but the good stuff is very good - and that carries the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opener “Keeping Pigs Together” is a tense and atmospheric opener - as good as anything on DJ Shadow’s “Endtroducing”. Here it’s not just the live drumming that intrigues, it’s the texture of the track - it pops and crackles, seemingly caught between nostalgia and propulsion toward the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third track “Shellback” is built around both a cooing vocal line (which I’ve always thought is about a cat) and a snippet of studio dialogue. Studio banter doesn’t always make for great records - there are a million hip-hop skits that prove this - but it works here. The reason might be the way that it cuts through the pretence that vocals are anything other than another instrument. Meanwhile the backing track is awesome, a plangent stomper - more texture. The watchword on “Our Aim Is To Satisfy” is texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the way that “The Rake” opens with a rap that sounds like it’s being performed by a smurf with bronchitis. It doesn’t mean anything and it shifts the attention to the sprightly live percussion (OK when you pay attention the difference is obvious). I also really like the needle in the similarly smurf-like sample that demands “Come on! What’s the name?!” over and over throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built on a similar idea, but less successfully, is “The Rough and The Quick”. It sets a frenetic backing to a vocal about various “top shelf” fantasies - I don’t think it works at all. To my mind, the repetition and harshness of the drum loops doesn’t come over sexy enough - and the lyrics are just a little too gauche for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bussing” and “I Stole Your Car” are pretty anonymous, though the latter is still better than most of the tracks on Massive Attack’s recent “Heligoland”. The last three tracks are amazing, and are the ones that really do it for me. A downtempo suite of breathtaking beauty, they culminate in “They’re Hanging Me Tonight” - a track that I often include in my playlists - I particularly like the dying feedback and fake CD skips towards the end (or was that in the mp3s from my CD copy? - they don’t seem to be there on Spotify…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Snapper aim to satisfy and they generally do on this album, which grafts live instruments and electronics in impressive fashion. Largely enjoyable and easy to get immersed in, it has me coming back to it time and time again. Be sure to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A note on the name of the album, some sources refer to is as “Our Aim Is To Satisfy Red Snapper”. Personally I think this is ridiculous. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Consider the Donut</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;or-from-there-to-here-with-the-simpsons&quot;&gt;Or, From There to Here With the Simpsons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old episodes of The Simpsons are great. The other night “Bart After Dark” was on and I really enjoyed seeing it again. It’s from season eight, the one where Bart ends up working in the Maison Derriére. I thought it was older; mind you, this makes it nineteen years old. When I thought about the episode later on that evening, I realised how the story anarchically set out in multiple directions before settling into its main storyline. This still happens in newer Simpsons episodes, though the show is rarely as joyfully chaotic now as it was back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me realise that my life has followed this same pattern. Settling in to a particular state of affairs after a period of anarchic abandon, with diminishing returns as the years go by. I don’t believe, as some people seem to, that The Simpsons isn’t funny anymore. It just can’t use the same techniques to make its way as it used to, it just got older. I feel the same myself: I used to get by making it up as I went along until something stuck, but nowadays I feel less convinced in my ability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the very next episode (Yes! Two consecutive episodes on two consecutive nights! Finally!), “A Milhouse Divided”, Homer consoles Marge with the following advice: “You can’t keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once, and move on.” There’s a lot to be said for the wisdom of Homer Simpson - even it is of the broken clock variety. There is a wonderful sense of non-attachment in both that quote from Homer and the scattershot opening to the “Bart After Dark” episode (which, in case you’ve forgotten, veers from V-chip to crashed oil tankers to satirising celebrity charity work to garbage angels to North by North West to caterpillars - before even reaching the burlesque house).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Marge: Homer, is this how you pictured married life?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Homer: Yeah, pretty much, except we drove around in a van solving mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though the episode (s) made me think about the cyclical nature of life, they’ve also reminded me of how important it is to embrace life’s events in the moment. I too can rock and roll from one situation to another and be confident that it’ll all make sense in the end. And yeah, things may go around and repeat themselves but that’s a cause for celebration. To repeat the words of Homer: “You can’t keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once, and move on.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Andy Weir, The Martian</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-martian-by-andy-weir"/>
   <updated>2015-04-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-martian-by-andy-weir</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received a copy of The Martian by Andy Weir for Christmas. This week during some annual leave I managed to finish it. It’s one of those novels that just flies by once it gets going. I’ve stayed up incredibly late to read it as it is full of those “just one more page” moments. It’s a readable and enjoyable story of an astronaut trapped on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Watney is believed to be dead following an accident during an emergency evacuation in a dust storm. With his life support readings at zero and unable to locate his body to be certain, his crew reluctantly abandon him on the red planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark survives but knows that he does not have enough food or water to survive long enough to be rescued. In the novel missions to Mars operate by sending an ascent vehicle in advance of a future mission - that’s the rocket that his colleagues escape in on page one. However there’s another mission, which means that there is another ascent vehicle. If he can work out how to get there and somehow produce some food so he can survive long enough, there is a chance that the next mission can collect him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile NASA discovers that Watney is still alive and makes plans to help him. This is where Weir’s writing lets him down a little. The characterisation of the secondary characters is weak and some of these sections contain very clunky dialogue. The voice that Weir gives to Mark is unusual and plays against our stereotypes of what we might expect of an astronaut, perhaps even to the point of stretching credibility. This makes all the sections that feature his point of view very entertaining. It’s a shame that the other bits around those sections feel like cliché.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did like the shifting point of view though, it’s a competent patchwork of styles with Mark’s journal as the main fabric and various forms of third person narration filling in the gaps. Especially effective are the sections that slow the action down and present Mark at the scale of the empty planet around him. These sections are almost like a film: I imagine huge pull back shots to point where he is a tiny speck on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think another writer might have used a more consistent structure. Sometimes it felt like each new development in the plot had to be introduced in a new style or with a new trick. This is a minor quibble, it certainly didn’t put me off reading to the end. However The Martian is, stylistically at least, almost as ramshackle in places as the protagonist’s modifications of his gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ultimately saves The Martian and elevates it above a mere Boy’s Own tale of being lost in space is the forensic attention to detail. The characters may feel a little rusty and the writing a little showy, but the effort put into creating a vivid and believable scenario shines through. It’s the attention to detail that makes Mark into a credible character that we fight alongside and identify with. I learned a lot about oxygen, hydrogen, water, and carbon dioxide from this novel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Martian has an interesting pedigree that puts it alongside books like Fifty Shades of Grey and Hugh Howey’s Wool in that it was self-published online first, became a big hit in print and is now headed for your movie screen. As soon as the 27th November this year in fact, starring Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain. The film version is directed by Ridley Scott whose sci-fi pedigree includes Alien (making this the second post in a row to hint that I will write about this film soon) and Blade Runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film intrigues me. Obviously I’m excited to see how The Martian looks on screen but so much of the fun of the novel is communicated in those first person logs and the vivid description of the technical details. It’ll be interesting to see how that works out. I recommend the film on the basis of the novel, though as with any other adaptation I also think you’ll better off enjoying the book first. It’s a cracking story and the film may address some of the novel’s flaws, but it’s harder to see how the intimacy of the first person narrative will come across. It’s not impossible though, it’s a trick that Moon managed to pull off. Also Mars movies are generally a disaster at the box office so it will be interesting to see whether The Martian can buck that trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, The Martian by Andy Weir is funny, gritty, exciting, and believable. It’s good for getting away from it all (it’s out of this world!) and it’s good for revisiting school chemistry lessons. Best of all, it makes a strong case for horticultural experiments on manned space missions to include more than just potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jodorowsky's Dune</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/jodorowskys-dune"/>
   <updated>2015-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/jodorowskys-dune</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot;&gt;Jodorowsky’s Dune&lt;/a&gt; is a documentary about outlandish Chilean director &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Jodorowsky&quot;&gt;Alejandro Jodorosky’s&lt;/a&gt; attempt at a film adaptation of &lt;a href=&quot;/dune/&quot;&gt;Frank Herbert’s Dune&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. As a big fan of the novel and of science fiction in general, I was very interested in this film. It does not disappoint. It gives a great insight into the mind of a little known (if slightly batty) director and shows even an artistic failure can lead to shock waves that can be felt in later work by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alejandro Jodorowsky had made two internationally acclaimed films prior to his recruitment to develop the film version of “Dune”. “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.badmovies.org/movies/eltopo/&quot;&gt;El Topo&lt;/a&gt;” is often described as an “acid western” - I’ve not seen it but the trailer looks disturbing and bloody. I’m too scared to embed it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-movie-The-Holy-Mountain-by-Alejandro-Jodorowsky-about&quot;&gt;The Holy Mountain&lt;/a&gt;” is a surrealistic satire of religious belief. You can (for now) watch the entire film on YouTube. Be warned as it is not safe for work and it is not suitable for people who are offended by religious or disturbing imagery. I’ve only watched twenty minutes so far (at the time of writing) but I will make time to watch the rest; it’s bizarre but compelling viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jodorowsky’s Dune allows Alejandro the chance to talk about his vision for Dune - and it’s a vision that brought together some incredibly talented people. Had he made the film with the actors and musicians who he says agreed to work on it, it truly would have been a cultural reference point that we would all be aware of - for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, Jodorowsky recruited French bons dessins artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud&quot;&gt;Mœbius&lt;/a&gt; to sketch out a story board based on Jodorowsky’s vision for Dune. This resulted in a book the size of a telephone directory that Alejandro regularly hoists on to a coffee table throughout the documentary - a tombstone to mark an unmade film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later there are interviews with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisfossart.com&quot;&gt;Chris Foss&lt;/a&gt; (who I now realise drew the covers of some of my favourite sci-fi novels - like the Asimov robot novels), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0639321/&quot;&gt;Dan O’Bannon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://giger.com/gigerframeset.php&quot;&gt;HR Giger&lt;/a&gt;. These last two would collaborate later on Alien - to terrifying and ground breaking effect (More on Alien to come…). Some of the music was to be performed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pinkfloyd.com&quot;&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s telling that no evidence of their contributions is offered - not even so much as interview with Dave Gilmour or Roger Waters. All we can know is that it would have been better than Toto’s dreck for the 1984 film (more on which later). The documentary is full of Moebius, Foss, and Giger’s creative contributions to the pre-production design, but it appears that the sound design was never entered into, at least not by Pink Floyd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jodorowsky also claims to have recruited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.traileraddict.com/jodorowskys-dune/orson-welles&quot;&gt;Orson Welles&lt;/a&gt;, Mick Jagger, and Salvador Dali (!) to various roles. Orson Welles is dead so can’t comment and Jagger is conspicuously absent, so I guess we have to take Alejandro’s word for it. Meanwhile the tale of Dali’s recruitment to play the Emporer of the Universe is so bizarre it must be true. It is also confirmed by Dali’s muse of the time, who was also offered a role (it was one of Dali’s conditions - along with being paid more than any other actor ever at the time, something that Jodorowsky got around by restricting Dali’s screen time to three minutes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Jodorowsky’s Dune offers a tantalising glimpse at what could have been a great film. The conceptual art looks great even today - the success that O’Bannon and Giger had with Alien goes a long way to upholding this and speaks volumes to how Jodorowsky’s treatment for Dune has influenced the science fiction aesthetic that prevails to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The version of Dune that &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get made also influences the documentary. It’s objectively terrible - to the point that some cuts are credited to Alan Smithee rather than the usually competent David Lynch. One of the best moments of Jodorowsky’s Dune is where Alejandro describes being dragged to a screening of the Lynch version: “I was really happy when I saw it… I didn’t want to see it… but IT WAS TERRIBLE!”. His laughter quickly becomes rueful, the Schadenfreude of someone who knows that they are right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This documentary is a great little film, particularly if you like Dune or are interested in how films are made. The introduction to Jodorowsky himself is a bonus. His wit and enthusiasm throughout show that if you dream big, you can’t really ever fail.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Fireworks Work</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/how-fireworks-work"/>
   <updated>2015-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/how-fireworks-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night an impromptu firework display occurred. I watched it from my bathroom window. Very pretty and somewhat extravagant, given that there’s no reason for one on the calendar. I could have filmed it on meerkat but it would have diminished the spectacle. However, it did at least motivate me to write this piece that I have put off for a while (since about November I guess?). One where I find out (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks&quot;&gt;look up on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) how fireworks work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fireworks are essentially showy explosions, so the way they “work” from a practical point of view is the same as how gunpowder works. Light the fuse, and an exothermic reaction emits lots of energy in the form of light, heat, and a big bang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese introduced the aesthetic element in the 7th Century (CE) and fireworks developed into a major part of Chinese culture. In Britain, fireworks have supplanted the more traditional burning of the Guy on “bonfire night”. It is likely that this transition occurred once China opened up to trade in the 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to classify fireworks: ground-based versus aerial, noise-focussed (make as big a bang as possible) versus aesthetics focussed (ooh pretty), and so on. I suppose I should focus on aerial fireworks as they were the ones that I could see from my window. And they were pretty, so let’s look at why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can split prettiness further in to colours and patterns. For the aerial side of things, we will also consider how this can be used to make patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to colours, it’s a matter of chemistry. You will no doubt be familiar with the bright white light emitted by burning magnesium, it’s one of the only experiments I remember from school chemistry lessons. (I also remember one with Bromine which really turned me off Chemistry. Achievement unlocked: make a joke about Bromine that no one will get.) Different metals glow different colours when they burn, so that’s basically that. It’s quite difficult to do precisely, which is why you tend to notice a “new” colour or why particular colours appear rarely. Last night I noticed a lot of magenta, so maybe that’s easier to produce now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For patterns you have to think meta. You have a serious of explosions occurring at different times in different areas of space. You can control the time of ignition with the length of the fuse and you can control the trajectory of launch by orienting your sub-fireworks in a particular fashion around the bit that explodes. It’s quite an exciting problem in physics and optimisation to create particular patterns and time them together. Obviously sometimes you fire multiple rockets because that’s easier, you just time it so looks like that the second bursts of stars erupted from where the first ones died back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, fireworks are a physical form of generative art. Now there’s something to think about - how could you apply the techniques of generative art to produce even better OMG firework displays? Competitive firework displays, now that’s something I could get into!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Little Bit Intimidating Really</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-little-bit-intimidating-really"/>
   <updated>2015-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-little-bit-intimidating-really</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is so much good writing out there. All you have to do is fire up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/uk/&quot;&gt;the guardian website&lt;/a&gt;, or download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/m/app&quot;&gt;medium app to your smartphone&lt;/a&gt;, or visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://xianity.me/&quot;&gt;my friend Barrie’s site&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://narami.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Lee’s&lt;/a&gt;, and so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to my little whisper into this great choir, it’s easy to feel a bit intimidated. How do I add my voice? How do I feel distinct? How do I do it as well as all these other wonderful writers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that after nearly four years and over five hundred posts, I might be less timorous. I can assure you that I still feel nervous about every single post. Almost every time I write a post I get hung up on a detail that prevents me writing. I find the biggest source of writer’s block is worrying about whether any of it matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And does any of it matter? Not particularly, not in the grand scheme of things. One thing I appreciate more after four years is that you do have to let things go. You can accept that you won’t win on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most good things in life, it is more gratifying to succeed after a struggle. I don’t believe that simply turning up again and again entitles you to succeed. However, I believe that when you do, you accept the challenge of learning and adapting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of life is that as you get better at something, you find new aspects to improve upon and new things that make you worry. Even with this self-awareness you will struggle and get stuck, sometimes you can improve too much in one go and leave yourself open to regression to the mean. It’s like training for a run, at any given time you can only put in a sustainable effort - if you try too hard too soon you might injure yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may well find it intimidating that there is so much other good writing out there but I also know that it is there for me to enjoy, that it communicates to me in a special way. The last few years made me realise that I am in the world, that the world is beautiful, and I am very happy to take my place in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;My name is Matthew and I’d like to say hello&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ned Beauman, Glow</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/glow-by-ned-beauman"/>
   <updated>2015-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/glow-by-ned-beauman</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Glow is about a guy called Raf, a Londoner whose life is going nowhere in particular; a state of affairs not helped by “Non-24 Hour Sleep/Wake Syndrome”. One night while experimenting with a new ecstacy-like drug that’s apparently derived from a social anxiety medication for dogs, Raf meets a beautiful girl and then loses her to the crowd in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment. From there a conspiracy evolves involving the titular dog-medication-derived drug, Burmese dissidents, corporate espionage, pirate radio stations, and urban foxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the opening lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When he first sees her, Raf is sitting on a washing machine about to swallow an eighth of a gram of what is apparently a mixture of speed, monosodium glutamate, and an experimental social anxiety disorder medicine for dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell from this that the tone is irreverent from the outset. This helps when the plot unravels toward the end: it peters out when it could have gone further. Instead you get a shaggy dog story with some sparkling comic writing thrown in, the jokes come thick and fast and had me laughing aloud. The quirky descriptions of modern life in London and the folksy homages to neuroscience (or perhaps, “near”-o-science) keep proceedings belting along at a good pace even if the plot fails to serve up the thriller-like tension you might expect from the same story in the hands of a genre writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of Thomas Pynchon’s Inherent Vice, another superbly written tranche of comic set pieces trawling through a conspiracy theory all served up in a druggy haze. Beauman’s writing sometimes seems a little too arch and self-conscious compared to Pynchon. Pynchon always holds his nerve, even with silly character names and when dispensing with any sort of plot altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that linka Glow to Inherent Vice is its strong evocation of a particular time and place. Inherent Vice is set at the end of the sixties, just as people are starting to realise that flower power is no kind of power at all. There’s a strong sense of the hippy dream beginning to sour. Glow is set in 2010 and most of the novel occurs within two weeks, save for two codas. Perhaps we will look back on this time as another when dreams turned sour. This time maybe the idea that our smart phones and the internet have freed us to pursue pleasure. Or perhaps even the notion that scientists would imminently solve the puzzle of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glow is chock full of social media and postmodern ideas but conspicuously free of what you might call “proper politics”, dealing instead with nebulous ideas about corporations, surveillance, and personal freedom - there are no Syrians or North Koreans or the like. No one runs amok on these streets. While Inherent Vice’s take on the past feels like “telling it like it is”, Glow feels a little short in this sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day Glow is a well-written boy meets girl story with a bit of silly drug stuff wrapped around it. I enjoyed it and read it quickly, a voracious rush of giddy excitement followed by a slight comedown afterwards. A bit like the mythical glow. I will check out Ned’s other novels (Glow is his third) and I look forward to reading what he tries in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The featured image is Benjamin McMahon’s fox motif from the cover remixed. I actually produced some more bizarre versions but decided on this variant to keep things simple.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talking of Inherent Vice, I haven’t seen the film yet. I just missed it at the cinema, so I eagerly await the DVD.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next book on my pile is Andy Weir’s “The Martian”.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>You Can’t Just Switch Off Free</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/you-cant-just-switch-off-free"/>
   <updated>2015-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/you-cant-just-switch-off-free</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/11/ministry-of-sound-streaming-switch-off-free&quot;&gt;Ministry of Sound boss Lohan Presencer does the cry baby act in today’s Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, complaining that Spotify’s freemium model doesn’t allow him to bathe in a Scrooge McDuck style swimming pool of golden coins any more. The cat is out of the bag for streaming music now, and no matter how much music companies cry foul they can’t stop Spotify and their ilk, and there wouldn’t be pots of gold waiting for them even if they could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presencer goes on to say that he fears for artist development in this post-streaming world. Personally I think he’s more worried about whether he can sell any more shitty themed compilations that aren’t dance music but nonetheless trade on Ministry of Sound’s credentials. But let’s take him at face value and explore this point. Will allowing people to stream some of the music that they like for free affect artist development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-used-to-be-called-radio&quot;&gt;It Used to Be Called Radio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I grew up listening to the radio and I never paid a penny for it. Most stations, were - like Spotify is now - supported by advertising revenue, a proportion of which goes to the artists and the supporting industry of talentless leeches like Presencer. Apparently radio stations still exist and &lt;strong&gt;have existed throughout the history of recorded music&lt;/strong&gt;, during which time the number of new artists and genres has increased over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Unfortunately most radio stations in the UK are now part of a soulless megacorp designed to do nothing but sell advertising. The group is called Global radio and I had a job interview with them last year. It was pretty close to my own personal hell - and the pay would have been shit too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;home-taping-didnt-kill-music-and-neither-will-piracy-or-streaming&quot;&gt;Home Taping Didn’t Kill Music, and Neither Will Piracy or Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there have always been pirate stations broadcasting up and coming music from hidden transmitters for no reason other than enthusiasm for the music itself. Artists have never received royalties from these stations but the exposure has been priceless for countless artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music piracy seems like a starker threat to business model of record companies and to the commercial prospects of artists. I am convinced piracy has hit artists hard, though many have thrived by adapting to rather than pouting against illegal downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an artist, piracy at least means there is someone out there listening to your music. If your music is good, an emotional connection can be forged with your listeners. They will seek you out and support you. Even if only a fraction do, it should be possible to convert that to sales of things that cannot be pirated: merchandise, live experiences, the chance of genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the invention of the radio, an artist would only ever be heard by the people who he performed to. Throughout the twentieth century that artist to listener ratio grew up to the heights that created the music industry’s largesse and spectacle. Now with hundreds if not thousands of musical microniches and the old media companies breaking down, artists are seeing a regression to mean with regard to the number of people they can reach out to. There’s still way more of a market for musicians to work with than there was fifty or sixty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-with-not-against&quot;&gt;Work With Not Against&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify and their competitors have the potential to be a useful tool for record companies. Not only can Spotify provide exposure for bands, circumventing the expensive business of plugging records for radio, but they can also provide valuable data on who is streaming a band’s records. If Presencer is so worried about the free tier of Spotify, why doesn’t he work at comparing his sales data with the streaming data from Spotify? He could work out who he needs to convince to take up paid Spotify subscriptions or find out what the market for his records is. If you know who’s streaming them, you know who might be tempted to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then of course there’s advertising. Perhaps Ministry of Sound could persuade Spotify and the like to tell them which adverts get clicked between their tracks so they know which companies to prostrate themselves in front of: please use our Eric Prydz tracks to help you sell more probiotic yoghurts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-no-armour-plate&quot;&gt;There Is No Armour Plate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the erosion of internet privacy by the likes of CIA and Facebook emboldens people like Presencer, whose traditional business models are threatened by the rise of streaming. They know that anonymity is being scratched off our internet connections faster than a flea from a fox’s ear flaps and that torrent sites are being slowed to a trickle by censorship. They think that piracy is gone, that people wouldn’t bother going back to it if they had to pay for everything. I think people are more resourceful than that, I don’t think they are indifferent to changing their habits and techniques if they have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, he knows that it’s easier to threaten the upstart than to change his own actions. But I think the message that will come back to him from music listeners and Spotify alike is that they will need to change or they will simply be swept away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-whether-it-hurts-artists&quot;&gt;Back to Whether It Hurts Artists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Spotify does hurt artists, and specifically I don’t think a free tier hurts artists. If Spotify were to replace its free tier with one costing £2.99 a month, how many people would actually convert to that knowing that they’d still have to sit through adverts etc? How much revenue could Spotify raise from advertisers if their user base were to shrink by 70%? How would that affect how much they could pay artists and record companies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Spotify’s payouts reflect the popularity of the music on the service. The good will out. There are no doubt big bucks payouts to people like Mark Ronson but also the long tail is longer and fatter than people might imagine. If record companies help Spotify to convert more users to subscribers without blackmail or coercion, there should be plenty of cash to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-disclosure&quot;&gt;Full Disclosure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a happy paying subscriber of Spotify. Their support account on twitter is friendly and helpful. I didn’t get the job at Global Radio so I’m probably just bitter - though I wouldn’t have taken it anyway because there’s no way you could work in London on the wage they were offering.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, February 2015</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2015"/>
   <updated>2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;aphex-twin-computer-controlled-acoustic-instruments-pt2-ep&quot;&gt;Aphex Twin “Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt2 EP”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aphex Twin follows SYRO (reviewed in &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-september-2014/&quot;&gt;Album Digest September 2014 here&lt;/a&gt;) with this 27 minute EP of music that, if we take the title literally, features computers playing acoustic musical instruments. It’s a very different sound to SYRO and sounds acoustic for the most part. It’s an important experiment about the role of the musician, one that is already blurred in the creation of electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get too drawn in to the philosophical connotations, I should discuss the music itself. The EP has about four long-ish pieces that could be considered complete, while the remaining nine tracks are shorter pieces that feel more like experiments and components of the longer pieces. This distinction between the long and short tracks is borne out by the track listing, though as usual it is unpronounceable inscrutable gobbledygook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the little experiments are cute like “piano un1 arpej” and “piano un10 it happened”, which tinkle away like some of the gentler pieces on “drukqs”. Another “disk aud1-12” is nine seconds of jazzy piano: without the provenance you would assume it was a quick improvisational flourish. Other pieces such as “DISKPREPT4” and the longer “disk prep calrec2 barn dance (slo)” experiment with rhythms that are recognisable as Aphex Twin music from albums like “Selected Ambient Works II”. (Incidentally, if you’re wondering whether there’s a “Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt1”, there isn’t: just as there isn’t a “Selected Ambient Works I”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed listening to this. On one occasion I was even able to forget that it was music being played by computers and simply think about how it sounds like the backing track to a Tom Waits song at one point and like Mike Oldfield’s soundtrack to “The Killing Fields” at another. Most of the time, I thought about the separation of composition and performance that has all but evaporated in the age of popular music, compared to classical music. I’d be happy to hear part 3 some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-orb-the-history-of-the-future-part-2&quot;&gt;The Orb “The History of The Future Part 2”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for a real part two. Part one was released a couple of years back, a disappointing retread of the Big Life and Island material. It was hamstrung by sample clearance, corporate indifference and a tin ear for what made the twentieth century version of The Orb so magnificent. Part of the problem is that they were on such a hot streak between 1989 and 2000 that you’d need twelve CDs and a complete disregard for copyright law to do a decent job. I’ve already given it short shrift before in &lt;a href=&quot;/amazing-subversive-revolutionary-adolescence/&quot;&gt;a post about their live album “Live 93”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something of a boon then that The Orb have had a leaner streak in the twenty first century, it means that this 4 disc set (3 CDs and 1 DVD) is a generous and succinct exploration of less essential but occasionally surprising material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins with a slight anomaly in the form of “Suck My Kiss”, the first ever release from the Orb back in 1989, an upbeat piece (that feels it has had samples removed from it) written in collaboration with The KLF’s Jimmy Cauty. But far from sticking out like a sore thumb like “Little Fluffy Clouds” would, “Suck My Kiss” manages to fit in nicely with what follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Orb’s recent phases are featured so I will start by listing what isn’t, namely the revisit of 1990s material on “Orbsessions vol 1” so “Mummie Don’t” and “Yungle” are overlooked. There is also no room for anything from the “Metallic Spheres” collaboration with David Gilmour, which is probably just as well. It might have been nice if some of the tracks from the “FFWD” album had been included. This collaboration with Robert Fripp was released in 1994 so it’s not part of this time line but if there’s room for “Suck My Kiss”, why not “Lucky Saddle” or “Hempire”? To my ears, either of those tracks would slot nicely in between and around the “Baghdad Batteries” material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discs stand alone as discreet compilations. The first takes the more straightforward material, mostly from “The Dream” (an album that was even more of an attempt to head back to “U.F.Orb” territory than “Orblivion”) and “Bicycles and Tricycles”. The latter is one of their most underrated albums, I saw them live around the time of its release and the newer tunes stood up against the classics. An intriguing track on this disc that I’d not come across before is “Apple Tree” - basically a remake of “Little Fluffy Clouds” with fewer contentious samples. It shouldn’t work but it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disc two mostly covers the more austere material released on the Baghdad Batteries album, with minimal tracks like “Super Soakers” and “Dolly Unit”. The only representative of the enjoyable “C Batter C” album is the seventeen minute soundtrack to the short film “Battersea Bunches” - a shame that the film itself couldn’t be included on the DVD disc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third disc covers the rest: some hard to find bonus tracks, the Kompakt material and the recent collaborations with Lee “Scratch” Perry. Unfortunately all the Lee Scratch Perry collabs are remixes (at least on the audio discs) which - apart from the OICHO remix of “Golden Clouds” - aren’t as interesting as the originals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently a new Orb album is due later this year and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaudimusic.com&quot;&gt;Gaudi&lt;/a&gt; is going to be collaborating with Tom and Alex. This sounds like a good combination, so I am looking forward to it. Hopefully putting together this excellent compilation will give them the knowledge of what they do best and the confidence to strike out for new territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;susanne-sundfør-ten-love-songs&quot;&gt;Susanne Sundfør “Ten Love Songs”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.susannesundfor.com&quot;&gt;Susanne Sundfør&lt;/a&gt; features in &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-january-2015/&quot;&gt;the Royksopp album I reviewed last month&lt;/a&gt;, “Ten Love Songs” is the only “part one” of this month’s digest. I found this album on Spotify’s new releases page and recognised her name; if you recall, I said that the track she featured on (“Running To The Sea”) was one of the best songs on “The Inevitable End” so I decided to give it a go. I listened to the first minute of the first song “Darlings”, thought “OK this is weird, a bit like an album of Christian show-tunes”, and paused it there and then because it was late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started again the following morning as I walked to work, partly because I didn’t have the time to change back to the Sleater-Kinney album which was my then favourite recent album for walking to work to. In that fifteen minutes I listened to the sequence of the first four songs and was blown away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off “Darlings” swells into a wonderful bittersweet song (the first line is “So it’s definite then? / … everything must come to an end”) that really could be in a musical and then “Accelerate” lurches into your ears, which sounds like ABBA on bad acid: detached Nordic vocals over squelchy bass and a crazy “Phantom of the Opera”-style organ break. And later on in the song, both. At the same time. After that “Fade Away” manages to sound like regular ABBA, which as everyone knows is no bad thing and very hard to pull off. Finally “Silencer” pulls off a wonderful film noir storyline with minimal string backdrop - key lyric: “…no one heard you but the stars / Through the rain of the sprinklers, a bullet pierced your heart”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there the quality remains high, even if the lyrical conceit of “Kamikaze” is a little gauche: you get everything you need to know about the song from the title. Following that, “Memorial” is a ten minute miniature masterpiece of murder and loss in collaboration with M83 (they previously collaborated on M83’s soundtrack to “Oblivion” - &lt;a href=&quot;/oblivion-a-short-review/&quot;&gt;the movie where Tom Cruise takes on aliens WHO BLEW UP THE MOON&lt;/a&gt;). The best bit is when it takes about six minutes off in the middle to explore a miniature classical piece. Throughout the whole album every element of each song sounds amazing and was, apart from three songs, produced by Susanne on her own. “Ten Love Songs” is the work of a major talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Delirious” and “Slowly” are both amazing pop songs. The first begins slowly, perhaps attempting to follow “Memorial” somehow, before it bursts into a playful double-entendre lyric about BDSM. Meanwhile “Slowly” revisits the same territory as “Fade Away” with an 80s vibe that one won’t make you cringe - her vocals are a hair’s breadth of those of Nina Persson on this song, bringing back memories of &lt;a href=&quot;/uc25/&quot;&gt;The Cardigans’ excellent “Long Gone Before Daylight” album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last of the ten love songs are “Trust Me” - a slow burning torch song that makes you want to do anything but trust its narrator - and “Insects”, a song in which a swarm of synths tries to overwhelm a lyric about keeping a clandestine sexual relationship a secret. The two combine to create a creepy end to the album, in particular the way that “Trust Me” slows things right down only for “Insects” to pick up the pace again and end the album on the wrong foot. It makes you want to play it all over again. I have done this. Repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only bad thing about “Ten Love Songs” is that there are only ten. It’s one of those rare albums where an artists throws everything on to tape and it all manages to stick and congeal into something fascinating. Given this masterpieces, Sleater-Kinney’s excellent “No Cities To Love”, and Björk’s “Vulnicura” glowering on the horizon (I’m waiting for a physical copy) then 2015 promises to be an excellent year for music.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #29: Let It Come Down by Spiritualized</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-29"/>
   <updated>2015-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-29</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I listened to Let It Come Down by Spiritualized for the first time during a difficult time in my life. I think this will always affect my feelings towards it. For me it’s a great big comfort blanket of a record. Coming after one of the all-time best break-up albums (in an artistic sense) in “Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space” perhaps it’s not that much of a surprise. Layered in orchestras, horn sections, and gospel choirs, it’s not understated at all but hopefully I can persuade you that it is a classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let It Come Down begins in fine form with “On Fire”, a song laden with horns, gospel choirs, barrelling drums and blues-y piano riffs. The first line is “Let’s see how high we can fly before the sun melts the wax in our wings” and it just gets more defiant from there. It’s reminiscent of “Electricity” off of “Ladies and Gentlemen…” but more upbeat. Continuing the upbeat feel is “Do It All Over Again”, perhaps the closest Spiritualized have ever come to making a genuine pop song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t Just Do Something” sums up the mood of the whole of Let It Come Down (and how I felt at the time I first heard the album): “I could lay around just stay in bed like my mama said / don’t just do something, sit around instead”. Starting off almost as a continuation of “Do It All Over Again”, around half way through it slips into a tempo change and becomes a blissed out homage to doing nothing: “To tell the truth / I like to lie about”. There’s a lovely little coda too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Out of Sight” always reminds me of Holst’s “The Planets” (probably Jupiter) because of its slow build up to orchestral bombast. The song oscillates between a slow simple verses and the over-the-top choruses that thrown in the orchestra and the kitchen sink. It was these hugely cathartic wordless phrases of brass and squally electric guitar that provided the comfort. By the time the lyrics kick in, you’re all pepped up for singing along. It’s a twenty-first century “Hey Jude”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then “The Twelve Steps” roars in and mocks the recovery programme: “the only time I’m drink and drug free / is when I get my drink and drugs for free / that’s rare indeed”. It talks about addiction as a cash cow for the weirdly religious twelve step programme. It’s probably wrong to eulogise drugs as fervently as this song does but it’s so much fun, I can’t help but join in: “you’re just as likely to find inner peace / by buying the stuff from the streets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rejoinder, the album the lurches to “The Straight and The Narrow”: “the trouble with the straight and narrow is that it’s so thin / I keep sliding off to the sides”. It’s weepy and saccharine, a bit Disney really all strings and electric piano. I think it’s one that I’ve usually skipped over but listening to it again, it’s not so bad. I think it’s as just as tongue-in-cheek about resolve and temptation as “The Twelve Steps” is about addiction and drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first “I Didn’t Mean To Hurt You” seems like a retread of “The Straight and The Narrow” but it slowly builds into something hypnotic and beautiful, incrementally layering different elements one on top of the other. The lyric cycles around too and then on three minutes it all bursts into life. Having made an earlier comparison to Holst’s “The Planets”, “I Didn’t Mean To Hurt You” is more like Ravel’s “Bolero”. It’s a great little tune that makes the most of its simple construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop Your Crying” is perhaps the most direct song on the album. It’s the only one that really feels directly addressed to the listener. I definitely remember it making me feel much better all those years ago. While “Come on baby stop your crying now” is a bit like saying “oh do chin up”, the pretty strings and the fizzing of the guitars make it feel sympathetic and supportive. Like “I Didn’t Mean To Hurt You” it builds to a crescendo. I’m going to have this song on stand by if I ever become a parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anything More” revisits the formula of the album’s middle section once more for luck but it’s only padding before the big finale. Think of a cross between The Beatles’ “Good Night” and Blur’s “Tender” and you’ll pretty much have it figured out, though there is a lovely lyrical violin line running through it that I didn’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big finale is the ten minute “Won’t Get To Heaven (The State I’m In)” which begins with some fluttering drones and synth noises before the guitars and strings kick in to introduce pretty much all the tricks of every track on the album so far over the next eight and a half minutes. It’s nowhere near “Cop Shoot Cop” but that song is one of those once-in-a-career moments. Instead “Won’t Get To Heaven” is a perfectly paced and well produced climax to the album that revisits all its themes and ideas. It fades into “Lord Can You Hear Me”, a cover of one J. Spaceman’s own songs by his previous band The Spaceman 3. Inspired by Low’s cover of the song, he converted the original to a gospel ballad. Much like the rest of the tracks it builds to a crescendo but this time releases some major guitar fireworks at the end. It’s a powerful climax to a fine album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost touch with Spiritualized after this album, though “Songs From A&amp;amp;E” and the more recent “Sweet Heart Sweet Light” are supposed to be very good so I guess I should dig them up on Spotify soon. I’d say that “Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space”, which I played the hell out of during my A-levels, is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; the better album, but “Let It Come Down” had a real impact on me. It really did make a difference at a bad time in my life (albums in this series are no stranger to that, &lt;a href=&quot;/uc24/&quot;&gt;see number 24&lt;/a&gt;) and helped me get better. It’s still one of my go-to records when I feel down or can’t sleep. As with every understated classic, I really recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Writing As It Happens</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/writing-as-it-happens"/>
   <updated>2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/writing-as-it-happens</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty close to a round number. To date I have written 298,500 words for this blog, not counting posts that I have discarded or deleted. This will be the 505th post currently on the blog, which makes for an average of just under 600 words per post. Some posts are just a picture or a video or a gallery though, so that distorts the average a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I can write the 1500 words I need to hit 300,000 in this post. It’s quite hard to write on demand and I often feel like my bright ideas are unassailable when I sit down to type them up. I’m conscious that I have to keep turning up to type but I’m not sure that it’s worthwhile to write posts like this simply to keep up a streak. A blog should be like an iceberg: the heft below the water line will make everything above it more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I often find that not posting for a day or two soon becomes a week or two, and that stickiness of the keyboard becomes a writer’s block. A dense fog of ideas descends, each idea nebulous alone but conspiring together to obscure my thoughts entirely. I don’t like not writing, I’m just not that keen on writing junk either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I came across some excellent advice: you don’t have to be interesting. That’s not to say that I’m not interesting, and I am sure that you are very interesting too dear reader, you just don’t have to make the conscious effort to be so. You just have to get on with the things you enjoy doing and hope that someone comes along to enjoy them with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the conclusion I reached is that I should just write something here every day or every other day, but not punish myself if I don’t. “Just keep swimming” as my aquatic namesake once said. I can always delete repetitive posts later and there’ll be nothing wrong with pausing for the night to make sure a post is the all the more awesome the following day. 298,850 words and counting!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On The Humble Cheese Grater</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/humble-cheese-grater"/>
   <updated>2015-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/humble-cheese-grater</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can’t beat a good cheese grater. Cheese just tastes better in a sandwich once it has been grated. It’s been proven by ACTUAL SCIENCE&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that this is the case: something about the increased surface area making it taste more zingy. Of course the cheese we are grating here is a nice mature cheddar, you can’t grate Camembert or Stilton (well &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; you can but why would you?). There are even cheeses that can be grated but don’t deserve it, take Red Leicester for example: the ear wax of the cheese world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I digress. This post is a tribute to the humble cheese grater itself. Graters I have known and such like. My parents’ cheese grater has lasted them all my life, a sturdy thing of good design. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westmerciasupplies.co.uk/cheese-grater&quot;&gt;A truncated rectangular based pyramid with tapered sides&lt;/a&gt; and different surfaces for grating different substances: cheese, carrots, cheese, dried bread for bread crumbs, cheese, and yet more types of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that design. Grab the handle on top of the cheese grater with your left hand and grate a big block of cheddar into fluffy yellow ribbons with your right. It’s “grate” stress relief! This might be because I think cheese on toast is the best comfort food ever (with Worcestershire sauce of course!) and so the grating might be part of the anticipation of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I now own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cheese-Vegetable-Grater-Stainless-Container/dp/B0097NJ0PC/ref=sr_1_20?s=kitchen&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1424121266&amp;amp;sr=1-20&quot;&gt;one of those weird tub with a cheese grater on top contraptions&lt;/a&gt;. It took me a while to be sold on this but I now think they are really good. Previously if I grated too much I’d eat the excess or have an enormous sandwich that made me feel as fat as butter (I’m grating cheese for sandwiches ninety percent of the time). These days I can save the rest for a later time - and it’s not losing weight or eating better that motivates me to use less cheese: it’s because I can make my sandwich for work the next day without having to grate any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the shadowy business of buying pre-grated cheese. For me getting the cheese grater out is so therapeutic that I don’t think I could abandon myself entirely to this particular vice. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robynsonlineworld.com/2012/09/why-you-should-grate-and-shred-your-own-cheese/&quot;&gt;lots of other reasons too, apparently&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless I do buy grated parmesan because it’s so expensive I might as well have it industrially grated for me. And mozzarella for when I’m making pizzas from scratch, if you’re all caught up in making the dough it’s good to save time on grating the cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about you? Do you favour the tall grater or the weird tub? What’s the strangest thing you’ve ever had to grate for a recipe? Get in touch and tell me! I’m off to grate enough cheese for the rest of this week’s sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Jackson X</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/jackson-x"/>
   <updated>2015-02-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/jackson-x</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I set myself the task of writing about a fictional character for this blog post, so this post is about Jackson X. His surname isn’t really X, it’s just one of the details about him that I haven’t fleshed out yet. This is because Jackson X is the one of the protagonists of the novel I’m (not) writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name of the novel is “The Summer of the Giant Space Whale”. I’m quite happy to discuss its plot and structure here. I don’t need to worry about anyone stealing the idea because it is already a rip-off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama&quot;&gt;Arthur C. Clarke’s “Rendezvous With Rama”&lt;/a&gt; (or, less charitably, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092007/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;“Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that a giant creature pops into the orbit of Jupiter one day. It takes no discernible action but it can be seen from Earth. It gets called the space whale. Different plans for the novel have a number of characters experiencing the summer while the space whale is there with the plot ending with the creature blinking out of existence as abruptly as it appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I realise now that the space whale is as much the subject of this post as Jackson X. I will get on to him in a minute.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whale is a traveller but why has it stopped in the orbit of Jupiter? Is it collecting fuel? Listening to the noise of the chattering creatures on Earth? Visiting children we don’t know about that swim in the atmosphere of Jupiter’s giant gas storms? Does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every version of the novel so far opens with the line “Jackson didn’t give a fuck about the space whale”. He’s out in the dust bowl one clear night. There’s no one around for miles. He smokes a cigarette and stares at the smear in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson may claim not to care about the space whale but this is because he is enduring a moral crisis, one that he feels is unseen by the rest of the world because it is all wrapped up in the alien. He is cheating on his grieving wife Marie with a young woman named Josie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie lost a brother a year ago and has withdrawn into herself. She stares at the news like everyone else, wondering if it is some sort of sign. The only time Jackson hears her speak she quotes from the book of Revelations. At night she sits up in bed and stares into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t really worked out who Josie is yet. I want her to be almost the complete  opposite to Marie, not just the grief-stricken worn-out person she is now but also the Marie that Jackson married. I’m trying to pull it all together - but the long and short of it is that Jackson would never have married Josie, only Marie. Perhaps Josie needs to be a man. Very “Brokeback Mountain”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with all this detail is that if I use flashback to show the reader the back story, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin&quot;&gt;macguffin&lt;/a&gt; with the space whale is pointless. The only way the alien contributes to the story is if it imposes a time frame on events and possibly a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Puritans&quot;&gt;new puritan style narrative&lt;/a&gt;. This constrains how I can get all that information across, though if I track the thought processes of memories in “brain time” (linking back nicely to &lt;a href=&quot;/building-brains/&quot;&gt;my post that was sort of about David Foster Wallace’s “The Pale King”&lt;/a&gt;). FYI The New Puritans insisted on stories told in the present tense with no flashbacks. While very few of its proponents became major names, the short story anthology &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/16/fiction.reviews1&quot;&gt;“All Hail The New Puritans”&lt;/a&gt; shows some of the powerful effects that can be achieved with these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson is a put-upon soul who feels as though no one watches over him. He loves his wife more than anyone but events beyond his control have made his wife into someone else. Josie’s never loved anyone but wants to steal Jackson away and get out of this town for good. It’s all pretty contrived, which explains why there’s another version that I stuffed with other characters from around the world - a sort of tapestry that describes the world that the space whale might observe. There are problems with that approach too though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if “The Summer Of The Giant Space Whale” is really a viable proposition, at least not in my hands. Not yet anyway. Perhaps it will work better as a short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month I will write about my ideas for a stronger novel, which has the working title “The Cities of Light”. It’s much more developed, a better idea overall, and is proving incredibly difficult to write. I’ve worked on it for about six years, much longer than TSOFTGSW.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Voting</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/on-voting"/>
   <updated>2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/on-voting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We hear a lot about our rights but these are given to us in return for fulfilling our responsibilities. One of these is engagement in the democratic process, and in particular voting. You should register to vote, that’s a no brainer. You should take an interest in what politics means for you locally, nationally, and internationally. On the day you to get to the polling station and cast your vote. Then you need to hold you representative accountable afterwards, even if he or she isn’t the person you voted for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously I’m writing this after some guy in charge of Boots said that a Labour government would be a disaster. And also apparently Facebook is going to save democracy by encouraging us all to register to vote. Now this is all well and good, we can all feel good about being registered. But can Facebook help with any other part of the process. It’s unlikely, they’d probably want to maintain their neutrality (unless of course a particular party had bought a bunch of ads) and they probably feel too bulletproof to overtly state their own preference for how you vote. Just because Big Brother is watching, doesn’t mean that he cares what you do either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Facebook can’t help you. And the way to stick it to the man from Boots is to engage with the process - even if you agree with him. The news is filled with dark portents for the future of democracy. The alternatives really are much worse, even if our system is not perfect. It can be improved and it can be protected, provided you turn up to be counted. Even if you think everyone is crap (more true of this election than any I can remember in my lifetime), then spoil your ballot. A spoiled ballot registers your decision. Staying at home does not, unless everyone does it (like in the Jose Saramago novel “Seeing”), and political power is too siren a force for everyone to pull in the same direction. If you don’t vote, you are saying all of these things at the same time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Democracy it is not important and I don’t care if it doesn’t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am not important and politicians can do whatever they like to me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The people who share my beliefs are not important and so I shan’t add my voice to theirs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corporations are more important than people, let the politicions do their bidding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that you won’t get screwed for voting, or make a big mistake (like nearly everybody who voted for the liberal democrats at the last general election), but you have to turn up and be counted anyway. Voting is an act of solidarity with those who share your views and those who fanatically despise them. Not voting is merely an act of solidarity with the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around a general election, the coverage seems never-ending. Though this can seem like a trial, it’s actually all there to provide with ways to learn about the candidates and their policies. And you don’t have to trust the media - your vote counts no matter what, so there will always be someone in your community to engage with directly. Moreover, it is important to discuss your choices and beliefs with others: exposing yourself to a plurality of views is the best way to test your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like all politicians are the same or that you have no voice in your area because you support party C and only parties A and B ever win there, but that was only true last time around. This time you have to find your fellow supporters so that even if A or B win instead of your choice, you will have a bloc with whom you can hold your new representative responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard work being a voter, but it’s a responsibility and a duty. You can’t just choose to opt out: if you don’t vote you can’t complain, and if you can’t complain how are you going to make anything better?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, January 2015</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2015"/>
   <updated>2015-01-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Album Digest January 2015 rounds up a few albums from the tail end of 2014 that I didn’t get much time to write about. The only one of these six to be released this month is the excellent “No Cities To Love” by Sleater-Kinney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sleater-kinney-no-cities-to-love&quot;&gt;Sleater-Kinney “No Cities To Love”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had heard of Sleater-Kinney before their boxed set “Start Together” was released in 2014. I was quite impressed that they curated their own Spotify playlist with the contents of the box. I added it and even downloaded the songs for offline listening but didn’t get around to much more than a cursory play of a few tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about Spotify playlists is that any additions get pushed out to you. In fact you even get little notifications pushed to your phone. So when S-K released “No Cities To Love” they added it to the “Start Together” playlist and this reminded me to check them out. For now I have just stuck to the new record because it’s good enough to hold my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love a bit of shouty punky guitar music so “No Cities To Love” is perfect for me. It’s really well produced and the songs are beautifully constructed with thoughtful lyrics. Now that I have a walk to work each morning once more, it’s nice to find something amazing to listen to. My favourite songs are the title track (I start my morning walk with it and put the rest of the album on shuffle), “Fangless”, and “Bury Our Friends”. Magnificent stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azealia-banks-broke-with-expensive-taste&quot;&gt;Azealia Banks “Broke With Expensive Taste”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delayed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vibe.com/article/azealia-banks-broke-expensive-taste-debut-delayed-again&quot;&gt;multiple times&lt;/a&gt; for three years and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchfork.com/news/57348-surprise-azealia-banks-long-delayed-broke-with-expensive-taste-is-coming-out-tomorrow/&quot;&gt;then suddenly released with no warning and a shrug of the shoulders&lt;/a&gt;, Azealia Banks’ delayed debut does not disappoint. It’s infectious, raucous and very very rude. Exactly what you need for the winter months, even if you can’t help but think it should have been released in the summer… about three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did the record company sit on it for so long? It’s such a good album. The fact that it doesn’t sound dated despite the delay is testament to Azealia’s savvy choice of collaborators, the sterling work of those collaborators, and her talent for weaving her flow around those sinuous beat constructions. She can also sing pretty well, and raps and sings in both English and Spanish. She covers Ariel Pink. It’s heady stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first eight or nine songs gel together perfectly while loop-the-looping through a variety of genres and styles meaning that “Broke With Expensive Taste” almost has a mixtape feel. If there’s one flaw it’s that when she starts to settle into a style and the collaborators thin out a bit toward the end of the album, it does start to feel a bit monotonous - even if that Ariel Pink cover does liven things up a little. Still, a front-loaded album with the quality of these tracks is hardly the worst crime ever in pop music. My faves are “Desperado”, “Heavy Metal and Reflective”, and “212”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it will be very interesting to see how Azealia Banks follows up this album. Hopefully she’s worked on more tunes while Universal sat on this album (Again, what the hell were they thinking?) and she’ll be able to release a follow up quickly. For all the infamous swears on “212” that made everyone sit up and take notice, I still think the most important line of the song is the first one: “Hey! I can be the answer”. As long as this delay hasn’t broken her, I think she’ll produce even better records than this one in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;museum-of-love-museum-of-love&quot;&gt;Museum of Love “Museum of Love”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from Nancy Whang’s stellar turn as part of The Juan Maclean (&lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-september-2014/&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;), the set of bands germinating from or out of LCD Soundsystem continues with Museum Of Love, whose main man Pat Mahoney was the live drummer for LCD Soundsystem. (Museum of Love are a duo and prior to taking on the name they remixed Battles’ collaboration with Gary Numan “My Machines” for &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-april-2012/&quot;&gt;the Dross Glop remix album&lt;/a&gt;. They also share a third member with The Juan Maclean.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their self-titled album attempts to be as arch as LCD were, though I’m not entirely convinced that are genuinely clever or are perhaps just trying too hard. Some of the song titles are a hoot, viz “Learned Helplessness in Rats (Disco Drummer)” and “The Who’s Who Of Who Cares”. I like some of the lyrics a lot, particularly the moments where obvious rhymes are implied and then under cut with something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout there’s a reasonably funky Brian Ferry kinda vibe and it passes the time well. There’s a similar rhythmic attention to detail as with the LCD Soundsystem albums, a sustained build up and controlled release throughout. In some ways the situation is similar to The Juan Maclean album, each track feels like a plane circling waiting for the moment to land, and it’s rare that you don’t notice the bump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we will have to see. This is a good start, some solid songs and some good musical ideas that, in the main, are well executed. What comes next for the Museum of Love project? If they focus on stuff as cool as “The Who’s Who Of Who Cares” it could blossom into something quite special. They need more songs that move the heart as well as the head because, as James Murphy showed, being detached is only worthwhile if you understand what it is that you were originally attached to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parkay-quarts-content-nausea&quot;&gt;Parkay Quarts “Content Nausea”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkay Quarts is an alter ego sub-band side project of two members of Parquet Courts, whose “Sunbathing Animal” was, for me, &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-june-2014/&quot;&gt;one of the best albums of 2014&lt;/a&gt;. “Content Nausea” is a brief album stuffed with little instrumentals, some loose songs built on jams, an odd cover of “These Boots Were Made For Walking”, some spoken word tracks, and about an EP’s worth of fully fleshed out songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might make “Content Nausea” seem like a distant second to “Sunbathing Animal” but despite its slapdash construction, it’s a worthy companion piece. For one thing it has a pretty concept keeping everything together, one that asks why it is that we are constantly buying things we don’t need and ignoring the world around us. The two spoken tracks, the title track and the wonderfully wry “The Map”, both offer a sly dig at modern life. Other songs like “The Slide Machine” (about a machine for scraping roadkill off motorways) and “Uncast Shadow of a Southern Myth” explore similar ideas from darker tangents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the single is pretty much a long dead memory, perhaps it is no surprise that a band releasing a classic album could pump out a mini-album of this quality within the same year. No more singles means no more B-sides and all those experiments and aborted ideas have to end up somewhere. I’m really glad they have ended up somewhere, these songs stand on their own and also mix in well with the jauntier more trad affairs on “Sunbathing Animal”. Give both of them a go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flying-lotus-youre-dead&quot;&gt;Flying Lotus “You’re Dead!”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with Sleater-Kinney, Flying Lotus was a name I’d heard of but I don’t think I’d listened to any of his music up until now. “You’re Dead” is his fourth(?) album so I’m a bit behind the curve with his music too. His music genre hops from hip-hop to drum’n’bass to free jazz, all over the place. Like “Content Nausea” above, he uses an underlying theme as a framework to contain all the dispirate ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it works really well and in some parts it strikes me as being like canonical classical music, moving from one theme to the next whilst remaining consistent with its overall narrative. I think. I was always diverted while listening to it and the genres he flits between are often tedious when there’s no let up in the action - as anyone who has sat through Roni Size’s later albums will testify to. My fave tracks are “Dead Man’s Tetris” because Snoop Dogg could rap about just about anything over just about anything and it would still sound awesome, and “Turtles” just cos it’s pretty cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole “You’re Dead” is a dense and interesting album, one that I don’t really have the space to unpack here. I think the artwork is interesting given various events in recent months but that’s a whole other story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;röyksopp-the-inevitable-end&quot;&gt;Röyksopp “The Inevitable End”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, for Röyksopp, “The Inevitable End”. The boys say that this will be their last album in the traditional format. I think it’s been coming. &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-september-2010/&quot;&gt;Their last album “Senior”&lt;/a&gt; was an ill-advised instrumental accompaniment to career-peak “Junior”, an idea that must have seemed like a good one at the time - two sides of the same coin, yin and yang, etc etc - but just fizzled out when it came to the execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On “The Inevitable End” they seem a bit bored and seem to have forgone the idea of curating an album altogether. It’s not so much an album as a dump of MP3s. Long stretches involve similar sounding songs with the same collaborators and you get the feeling that if they were still trying, they’d have picked one out of the four dreary collaborations with Jamie McDermott and/or Ryan James (the best is “Here She Comes Again”), ditched “Save Me” in favour of “Running To The Sea”, and perhaps written a few more interesting instrumentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m being snarky because I love Röyksopp and it’s disappointing that this isn’t another album as good as “Junior”. The opening track “Skulls” is as good as anything they’ve ever done, the remake of “Monument” works really well (&lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-may-2014/&quot;&gt;no noodly trumpet this time around&lt;/a&gt;) and “Running To The Sea” is a great song in keeping with tracks like “What Else Is There?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that “The Inevitable End” highlights Royksopp’s own misgivings about the future of the album format. Why should spend time perfecting a song and then embargo it until you’ve completed nine or ten others for an album? Why prevent yourself from remixing and innovating your music in order to meet record company schedules? If songs are now digital and ephemeral, why make albums at all? Why not just pump out a track a month on your soundcloud feed or release individual tracks on limited edition vinyl?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this isn’t the last we hear of them. I still remember the first time that I heard “Melody AM”. I wasn’t that impressed, but then I had just pulled an all-nighter to get my undergraduate project on elliptic curves finished. It wasn’t until I heard “Sparks” on a compilation a while later that I went back to it and became obsessed by it. Back then singles really extended the life of an album and “Melody AM” had some good singles with remixes and bonus tracks that pulled things in different directions. Perhaps whatever they have in mind for their next phase will involve this extra fluidity. Even if it doesn’t, I still hope that it involves more music at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #28: The Meadowlands by The Wrens</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-28"/>
   <updated>2015-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-28</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the first lines of “The House That Guilt Built”, the soft cricket-laden lament that opens The Meadowlands by The Wrens, is “I’m nowhere near where I thought I’d be”. The last line of the whole album is “this is not what you had planned”. These bookending lines set the tone for this shimmering, ramshackle masterpiece - a fatigue and careworn pride in failing to meet impossible standards writ large over its first and last eighty or so seconds. “The Meadowlands” is probably the best record you’ve never heard, and once you have heard it, you will never be the same. Even better, it changes and you change with every single listen. If you’re living your life and you really mean it, then this is the record for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what makes a masterpiece? Well for a rock album you want great songs that mean something and stand out as works of art. You need something recognisable and yet still fresh and distinctive. You need those songs to be sung with a voice that moves you, that you recognise as your own. And you need at least some of those songs to really rock out. On “The Meadowlands” The Wrens deliver all of this in spades. Take second song “Happy” which moves through about three movements in its five and half minute run time - from stoner groove to a pogoing riff, tracking the course of a relationship from doting courtship to bitter ever-after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next track “She Sends Kisses” is even better. It starts by picking through biographical detail over reedy sounding accordion before building in to a weary chorus, before doing the same over again. The striking feature of the song is how much the riffs and the counterpoint in the melodies do as much work for the song as the lyrics do, particularly in the gentle final minute or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having hit upon the Beach Boys style vocal take offs for “This Boy Is Exhausted” another band might have really pushed idea but instead it’s pushed to the margins and it’s actually the beautiful walking bass line that provides the connecting tissue between verse and chorus that is the real jewel of the song. It’s a great song that you can sing along to but if you listen closely you’ll hear that it’s immaculately constructed, almost built for that serotonin hit of totally understanding, but not quite being able to sing along to, the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for “Hopeless”, though in this case you’ll be excused for simply being blown away by the excellent lyrics and the raw emotion on display. The guitar solo before the chorus is amazing but you’re more likely to remember the lyrics that follow: “Go find someone who wants you / Someone to pray to, get on your knees to / Lay down and please you too / It just won’t be who’s there again” and “Go thank yourself for nothing / It’s really all you’re good for”. The song is over six minutes long but it flies by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Faster Gun” is perhaps the first filler song, a punky stomp. Then a ballad, “Thirteen Grand”, comes along - all Elliott Smith style vocals, along with piano and strings. It’s mellower than anything else on the album, a pean to the dumb luck of falling in love. The chorus runs “Is this real at all?” as the songs swirls on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noise resumes with “Boys You Won’t” with a wonderful see-saw riff and a lyric that seems to echo those wonderful early Death Cab For Cutie albums: “I’m feeling down, but I stood up / Dead above the ground, but I stood up”. Again the production is perfect, this song is a perfect example of how to play a great lyric against a fantastic guitar riff. It’s almost the perfect rock song. The next song “Ex-Girl Collection” manages to repeat the trick too, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wrens.com/records/the_meadowlands#exgirl&quot;&gt;some amazing lyrics that you just have to read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love “Per Second Second”, a bouncy throw away number with a chunky riff - the type of song you don’t have to think of a reason for liking other than for the fact that you can hum along to the guitar riff and jabber with the nonsensical lyrics. In fact, it’s like a R.E.M.-indebted slower cousin of Blur’s “Song 2”. It lurches into the de facto title track “Everyone Chooses Sides” which also has one of those wonderful scuzzed out glam rock riffs, but the lyrics are about tough times and are delivered, as throughout, with a searing mix of integrity and pain. I think the key line is “I’ve walked away from more than you imagine and I sleep just fine” but it all goes by so fast it’s hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things slow down with “13 Months in 6 Minutes” - a heartbreaking six minutes that discusses an early twenties relationship that lasts just the titular thirteen months. There’s something universal about the story here, at least for those of us who weren’t married off by the end of our twenties. The last line is devastating but most of us have been there: “I knew we’d never write (somehow that seemed all right) but this counts as calling three years out.” The lyric plays out in half the run time and the rest feels like a little jam until there’s a little revelation at the end as the song fades out: “maybe that’s enough” - perhaps the joy of looking back at the same situation later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album proper (Yeah there are bonus tracks. Ugh.) ends with “This is not what you had planned”, a little ballad that begins with a clearing of the throat and then some very heartfelt near-screaming of the line “Don’t you even know what’s right?” and then the words of the title. It’s understated, and even a bit like an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Meadowlands by The Wrens is a masterpiece. You can live in it like your favourite movie or favourite novel. The songs are treacherous and change meaning with your mood and the mood of others in your life. It’s depressing and celebratory. It moves your body and your mind. It’s brilliant and you need it in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Iain M. Banks, Feersum Endjinn</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/feersum-endjinn"/>
   <updated>2015-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/feersum-endjinn</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Feersum Endjinn is one of Iain Banks’ few non-Culture sci-fi novels. Like the Culture novels, an existential crisis drives the plot: in this case the action takes place on Earth in the far future and the sun has aged to a point where it will grow and swallow the earth. This is referred to as the Encroachment. The characters are divided between the good guys who seek to find a solution for the greater good and bad guys who use the Encroachment to consolidate their power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the experimental construction makes Feersum Endjinn feel like one of Banks’ weaker novels, it also serves as a reminder that few authors write from multiple points of view as well as Banks did. In fact, the entire novel is a game of points of view. Each chapter is split between four factions representing different plot elements and character not only hop in and out of one another’s heads, but they also meet different representations of themselves. One strand of the narrative is written as a stream of consciousness: ravver weerd spellin lik this iz yoosed, mayb Banx wus reedin erly drafs ov Tranespottin? As with my experience of reading &lt;a href=&quot;/hawksmoor/&quot;&gt;Hawksmoor&lt;/a&gt;, it’s surprising how quickly you adapt to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other standout feature of Feersum Endjinn is the compelling setting of the Serehfa Fastness - an enormous building that houses an entire state. Once the base of a space elevator, it is now home to the humans who stayed behind after the rest left for the stars. It’s never explicitly stated but going by the clan structures and feudal society described, you get the impression that society has regressed. Superstructures abound in the Culture novels written after Feersum Endjinn, though orbital habitats feature heavily in &lt;a href=&quot;/consider-phlebas-a-picaresque-in-space/&quot;&gt;Consider Phlebas&lt;/a&gt;. The Fastness is perhaps the oddest and most compelling character in the novel. In fact, even in the Culture novels the only other superstructures that come close are the shell worlds so vividly described in Matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Feersum Endjinn would make for a decent film or mini-series. If it were made as a film, I’d try to compress each of its forty sections into roughly four minute pieces - though that would leave you with a near to three hour film that chops between four main strands which might be a bit difficult to follow. Certainly there’s nothing in the novel that can’t be rendered with CGI and there’s enough intrigue and action for it to be exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, Feersum Endjinn is an enjoyable and uncomplicated sci-fi novel. If the idea of that appeals and you’re put off the Culture novels for whatever reason, you could do worse than give this one a go. For more thrills and spills try &lt;a href=&quot;/against-a-dark-background/&quot;&gt;Against A Dark Background&lt;/a&gt; (Feersum Endjinn is the better novel overall though). However, the best of Banks’ non-Culture novels is “The Algebraist” and I’ll write about that in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t just take my word for it, here are some additional reviews:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Happy New Year 2015!</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/happy-new-year-for-2015"/>
   <updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/happy-new-year-for-2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a brief message to wish everyone a happy new year. Getting my flat connected to the internet continues to be a trial so it’s still not as easy to post as I would like. However, I have some workarounds now&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I hope to write (and post) more often from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone I make resolutions at this time of year, though as the years pass I realise that the best resolutions are to apopt a new way of being rather than a new way of doing. I find it quite difficult to “change” myself by willpower alone. I think this is true of most people. Travelling taught me that it’s better to evolve. I just do one little thing differently and then try to notice the benefits as they accrue. As you become are of how you are changing it gets easier and you can shift your focus to doing another little thing a bit differently, a bit better. At least that’s the theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then of course, there’s the arbitraryness of the date. Why January 1? Why not June 17? At least if you were to pledge to run more on June 17 it would (probably) be better weather for it. Sure if you can adopt better habits now while it is cold and the days are short&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; then more power to you, but I find I am more likely to fail if I make things tough for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve set a reminder on my phone to sort out my “new year’s” resolutions on June 17. Feel free to join me. It’s for the big stuff, the really big changes: the weights, the runs, the (shudder!) vegan diet. It’s arbitrary mind you - I haven’t even checked whether it falls on a friend’s birthday yet (awkward!) - and subject to change at short notice. In the mean time, I’ll just try to change a little bit at a time - starting by showing my face on here more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me finish by wishing you a happy and prosperous new year. Whatever your ambitions and dreams are, I hope you are closing to achieving them by the end of this year. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Well, I still need an idea for how I am going to post on a Sunday - might just be a picture or two shunted out using the mobile app or Pressgram. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Apologies for the northern hemispherical focus here! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>On convictions, whereas to the strength of and belief in same</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/on-conviction-and-belief"/>
   <updated>2014-12-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/on-conviction-and-belief</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Overlong reflection upon the past is one sure way to make yourself unhappy so I try to avoid it. Nevertheless it becomes unavoidable at this time of year, especially if, like me, you are somewhat prone to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time last year I was, &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/south-america-trip-part-11/&quot;&gt;as detailed in the most recent report of my South American adventure&lt;/a&gt;, in La Paz, Bolivia. I think I felt as lost then as I do now, though back then I had the novelty of new places and good friends to steer me through. This year I find myself stuck in an expensive flat that I can hardly afford to heat in a city where I hardly know anyone: it seems ridiculous that I had more people around me in La Paz than I do here but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on all this made me think about this feeling of being lost - I certainly wasn’t sure of my place going into 2014, or 2013, or for many of the years before that. And I realised that you do feel lost if you do not (or are not able to) live your life with complete conviction at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the problem that I had before I went away. On the trip I was able to say “I’m travelling now, this is what I do”. I didn’t have to feel like I was good at it in order to be happy doing it (most of the time I did not have a clue), but at least - over all that unknown terrain ironically enough - I knew what I was doing, that there was an itinerary, a course. I was less sure of what might come after the tour, but Bolivia was barely the end of the beginning so I didn’t have to worry too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And going in to 2015?  I feel like a lack of conviction has returned to my life. My current path is one of necessity rather than invention and I feel very uncertain about it. Every wobble of the household and every sigh of boredom feels like a return to square one. I can’t mourn a life I didn’t want nor regret my rejection of the same, but I can wonder whether this is the best alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes back to conviction. A driver of happiness is the belief that you have a mastery and purpose, that you are indeed doing the very thing that you, and few people else, were meant to do. I think I lack that conviction: I cannot convince others because I am not convinced myself. I’m nearly thirty five and I still have no idea what I am supposed to be doing, or even what I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, one is not &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be doing any given thing - or else we would all be conscripted to our callings, and, funnily enough, I suppose I would not have these uncertain feelings. I just have much conviction in what I am currently doing, and have no idea what I could be doing that would make me feel any different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence I am lost. My mission for the year ahead: go find the place where I can rest, convinced in myself - and therefore convincing to others - that I really should be there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>October and November 2014</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/october-november-2014"/>
   <updated>2014-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/october-november-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently started a new job and moved in to a new flat. This means I’m too busy to write any long blog posts at the moment. Also I’m still not quite at home there, so I tend to spend my evenings tidying up or setting up new things. It’s a shame because I have plenty of things to write about (even without observations on moving, starting a new job, etc) but I guess the writing will happen eventually…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s funny is that October and November are usually purple patches for my writing. My archives tend to look a little thin in Decembers due to the demands of the season, and some years I publish short stories during  advent and then delete them after Twelfth Night. I’m not sure I have enough material for an advent calendar this year but if I get enough time to think about it, I will certainly try to come up with something. Otherwise, I can fill out the blog with all the posts that built up while I didn’t write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is an adventure at the moment. It has been for over a year. I got myself away from a toxic job and from people who were doing me no good. I’ve reconnected with my family, made new friends, and now have a new career path to explore. Starting again has its frustrations for sure, but for the moment I can say for certain that I am happy. It is a good feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Building Brains</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/building-brains"/>
   <updated>2014-10-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/building-brains</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a longer form post about artificial intelligence inspired by reading a little bit of “The Pale King” by David Foster Wallace and putting a picture of a “ghost” up on Instagram. This might be the last of these that I’m able to write for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-not-reading-the-pale-king&quot;&gt;On Not Reading “The Pale King”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Pale King” is the third and final novel by American author &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/david-foster-wallace-appreciation-david-gates-89371&quot;&gt;David Foster Wallace&lt;/a&gt;. He was working on it when he committed suicide in 2008. It was compiled from incomplete notes and released posthumously in 2011. It deals with several characters around an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service&quot;&gt;IRS&lt;/a&gt; tax office in Peoria, Illinois&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t read all of “The Pale King”, just the first few pages. I think it might be too much for me to take on at the moment. This post though is not one about me not reading a book. I was struck by how well written it was, there’s an amazing section near the start&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; relating the thoughts of a character as he sits on a plane and stares at the ground below. The focus of these thoughts is split between revision for a tax certification exam and the memory of something going very wrong in a previous (tax-related) job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very skilful writing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There is a delicate balance to be struck. It’s not just a matter of simply rattling off two trains of thought and letting them collide with one another. It requires profound thought about how and why one thought interrupts one another, the way in which they do, and how a person’s internal parliament speaks for their character and experience. It is something that I have attempted, but I wasn’t anywhere near successful so I really admire the craft on display in those passages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly DFW thought a lot about thinking and I really wish I had the time to devote to reading both “The Pale King” and “Infinite Jest” closely and thoroughly. My job hunt has meant spending a lot of time in preparation for interviews and I felt guilty whenever I interrupted that process, especially for the pursuit of pleasure. Having found a job, it will probably sap my time and energy to the extent that I won’t be able to lose myself in long novels. I won’t mind, going back to work is a relief. I’m sure I will find time for the odd novel somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-something-that-isnt&quot;&gt;The Something That Isn’t&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what turned my thoughts back to that excellent writing? I posted the picture below to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/mattischrome&quot;&gt;my Instagram&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks back with the caption “A Photo of something that isn’t there”. Someone asked whether it was a ghost. With Halloween coming up it seems appropriate to revisit it. Yes, I photographed a curtain precisely to play trick and elicit that response, but the unreal thing that I referred to was the sunlight falling upon the curtain. I was inspired by a joke I’d seen earlier that day. “Which of the following mythological creatures casts no shadow?” The answer of course is “none of them”. Something that does not exist casts no shadow. Naturally this inspired an attempt to take a picture of something that did not exist, that was not there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/SomethingThatIsntThere.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photograph of something that isn't there&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy (Hamlet, Act 1, Sc 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on settling on the sunlight caressing the curtain (simultaneously realising it was a good way to emphasise some recent good weather), I realised that this is something humans (or rather their brains) do all the time. There is a whole extra layer of information in the world that exists purely as contextualisation, emotion, and metaphor. It is largely intuited and untaught, and it’s hard to explain your version of that layer to other people. It is easier if you share some cultural or physical attitudes, but not always. In fact, there are multitudes of such layers. Some layers are unique to our subjective experience and persuading others to understand this layer can be very difficult. Yet sometimes someone completely alien to us can show us an entirely new way of seeing things around us, it is possible to explain and transmit these layers. I think our brains working this way is one of the main reasons why we are the apex species of this planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone interested in machine learning, I’m interested in the ramifications of this for computers. How do we encode the thought process that tell us there is sunlight on the curtain? That the white material is not a rag or a ghost but a curtain? That there is ‘light’ of any description in the picture? And that it is specifically sunlight? What makes a human look for a “ghost” when the caption tells us that the picture is of “something that isn’t there”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-next&quot;&gt;So What Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why is it worth thinking about thinking in this way? There is so much about our lives that remains unknown to one another and to computers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Now that “big data” is upon us, I think the next big revolution will be centred on the cloaking of algorithmic behaviour. Streaming services are now battling to provide “curated content” - this is supposedly one of the reasons why Apple bought Beats Music - and as our interactions with recommendation algorithms become more commonplace, those that feel “most human” will undoubtedly fare the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the ongoing arms race of cyber crime there will no doubt be advances in disguising the metadata and transaction patterns that currently give cyber-criminals and terrorists away. Increasing detection and interception promotes innovations in camouflage and stealth, necessitating increasingly sophisticated pattern recognition techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final example, we are now (mostly) living longer and more comfortably than at any point in human history. In all likelihood we will continue to do so, despite the challenges of climate change and possible overpopulation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It seems ridiculous to predict that loneliness and depression may be the major public health cosequences of this process, but the UN and the World Health Organisation &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-934j-introduction-to-global-medicine-bioscience-technologies-disparities-strategies-spring-2010/readings-and-lectures/MITHST_934JS10_ses1_proj.pdf&quot;&gt;have considered this possibility&lt;/a&gt;. Greater understanding of our nuances of thought may prove useful in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2012/pattern-recognition-technology-may-help-predict-future-mental-illness-in-teens.shtml&quot;&gt;identifying potential cases&lt;/a&gt; or in providing &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=77173&quot;&gt;greater support to those who need it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am obviously exposing the merest tip of the iceberg here. There is so much more that we need to learn about how our brains work and so much that we need computers to do with that information. Fiction is testament to how we can develop convincing working models of the mind in specific instances but obviously there is still a long way to go. Despite this, the pace of technological advancement in the last century gives me confidence that a genuine&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; computational model of the mind will be created in my lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, without doubt, a complicated task; one that can be subdivided into a great fount of unsolved problems. Additional intermediate and incremental steps will be required, as the problem requires us to understand the how and the why of not just the goo, but the underpinning philosophy too. I think we should emulate our own brains first and then make improvements. A genuine mind that encompasses rooms of computers running in concert would be better than, say, a robot that can’t write poetry. The more ambitious we are, the greater the reward will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A place also celebrated in Sufjan Stevens’ “Illinoise” album. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Or rather, placed near the start by the editor. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The non-fiction collection “Both Flesh and Not” and the little that I’ve read of “The Pale King” reinforces my belief that DFW was a great writer. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is obviously a parallel debate about &lt;strong&gt;how much&lt;/strong&gt; we should allow computers (and the people in charge of the computers, while they are still in charge,) know about the content of our thoughts, and how much of ability we should donate to them. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some people are very pessimistic about this subject. I for one believe that the more of us there are, the better our chances of creating the people who will invent the quantum computer, the universal materials generator, or the faster than light drive. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Genuine but rudimentary. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, September 2014</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2014"/>
   <updated>2014-09-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Album Digest September 2014 contains four amazing albums, including the long-awaited return from the Aphex Twin, and an album from Cymbals Eat Guitars released about a week after I wondered what had happened to them. Spooky. Rounding out the selection this month are a cool punky-disco album by The Juan Maclean and a truly remarkable offering by Vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aphex-twin-syro&quot;&gt;Aphex Twin &lt;em&gt;SYRO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SYRO&lt;/em&gt; is the sixth album by Aphex Twin and his first official Aphex Twin release since Drukqs in 2001. Announced with a typically cryptic track listing at a month’s notice via the dark web, along with artwork that resembles a tax receipt for the costs of releasing the album, his anarchic streak appears intact. Therefore the most suprising thing about SYRO is just how conventional it sounds on first listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason SYRO feels a bit subdued to begin is because the tracks are pretty mellow and evenly paced. Unlike Drukqs, which veered between beautiful prepared piano pieces and full-on drill’n’bass madness, this album harks back to earlier efforts like Richard D. James Album (RDJ) and I Care Because You Do (ICBYD). The eerie voices on minipops 67 [120.2][source-field mix] hark back to the creepy childsongs on To Cure A Weakling Child, while XMAS_EVET10 [120][thanaton3 mix] would sit nicely on either of the Selected Ambient Works albums. The next track produk 29 [101] even throws in the odd incongruous swear to its weird melted take on musak, but this too is nothing new: you can find it in Cock/ver10 off Drukqs and Come On You Slags off ICBYD. The impression you get is one of comfortable craft and of laurels being rested on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that SYRO is a complete time warp back to the 90’s. 180db_ [130] has something of a 2-step shuffle to it, while CIRCLONT6A [141.98][syrobonkus mix] updates the Aphex Acid template in a manner so confident and sleek that it can only have been made this century. It’s so crowdpleasing that it has an almost Daft Punk feel to it and it’s not the only one, syro u473t8+e [141.98][piezoluminescence mix] also sounds like the overrated French funkers. The other CIRCLONT track, CIRCLONT14 [152.97][shrymoming mix], manages to marry breakbeats with those burbling acid synths more successfully than on any of his previous tracks. The innovative aspect of SYRO is how amazing and together everything sounds, as though it were pay-off for all those experimental and abrasive albums we endured in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other theories. Richard D. James’ most revered work is now almost a quarter of a century old, and most audiences aren’t that far behind the curve (nor are that many artists that far ahead of it). There are teenagers alive now who will listen to SYRO and consider it to be a throwback, kids that think Selected Ambient Works, Vol. 2 sounds like classical music. SYRO feels like the distillation of his previous work into one joyous album. It is enjoyable to listen to because it feels &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; rather than generated and it’s weird for that to feel disappointing, because it really shouldn’t be. He claims to have recorded vast amounts of material over the last thirteen years, so perhaps there are still uncharted territories for him to cover. Perhaps these are the only gems that remain after scouring the mines. Perhaps Warp Records really need the money and there are five more very similar sounding Aphex records to follow over the next few years. In any case, the joy comes from the music rather than knowing what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cymbals-eat-guitars-lose&quot;&gt;Cymbals Eat Guitars &lt;em&gt;Lose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cymbals Eat Guitars are a four-piece indie rock band from Staten Island, New York. Lose is their third album since their debut Why There Are Mountains was released back in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have written about their second album Lenses Alien three years ago but I got caught up writing about a bundle of electronica albums that I’d bought instead. A shame, because Lenses Alien is a fantastic record. It’s a bit complex though and the band admit in interviews that it’s difficult to play live, which partly explains why Lose is a ton more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal events for the band have also lead to the songs being darker and more autographical than before. The increase in emotional investment in the lyrics is an interesting counterweight to the simplification of the songs. For instance, musically the opening song Jackson is triumphant: all cooing backing vocals and soaring guitars, but lyrically it talks about a friend messed up by drugs. This continues on Warning with lyrics you’re looking mightily ghostly / like Bowie on Soul Train and the shape of true love is terrifying over a Springsteen-esque rock out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere the lyrics win out over the songs. Child Bride has a lyric about an abused school friend who later turns up to a gig with a girlfriend who has got her into crack. What’s awful is that if it’s true then it’s a heartbreaking tale of how a life changes in an instant that the narrator witnesses, and even if it’s not true, you just know that it could be true for &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, that things like this happen all the time, and that’s just impossibly sad. And the sing-song chorus captures something almost as bad, the feeling of guilt that comes from knowing you were there at the moment when things changed (not just the narrator of the song, you, me, everyone - we all have these moments in our lives) and this is what eats up our twenties, what causes us to lose our twenties, the regret for the ones who didn’t make it. We might not end up loaded all the time, but we’ll be dodging it in some way too. How will this ever change? I don’t know, you don’t know, and neither do the people in these songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Lose ends up being this lyrically dark album that is punched through with the light that music provides. It’s strong and meaningful stuff. It reminds me a lot of The Wrens (who are mentioned in the lyrics) and their album The Meadowlands, which was about getting to thirty and still not understanding what you’re supposed to be doing. Lose is a sort of prequel to that. At the end of your twenties you have a mythology of your life built from your experiences and mistakes, by then you have found the thing you need to get you through the dark. Most people are lucky and find that it’s a particular person, or a job, or their children. Others are not so lucky and face entering their thirties with an all-too-pernicious means of dealing with their dread at what is to come. Those people, and I counted myself among them, often feel as though they are about to fail. Lose captures that feeling but also provides a salve: with tunes this good at your back, no matter how sad, how could you lose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-juan-maclean-in-a-dream&quot;&gt;The Juan Maclean &lt;em&gt;In A Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Juan Maclean are a band on the DFA label consisting of John Maclean and Nancy Whang. Nancy was in LCD Soundsystem too. In A Dream is the third studio album by The Juan Maclean, if you exclude things like mix albums. I meant to review it last month but it only recently appeared on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a jolly and upbeat album. The opening track Space Is The Place sounds exactly how I’d imagined it would, like a cross between New Order and Giorgo Moroder’s soundtrack to The Neverending Story. It only gets going when Nancy’s vocals kick in and through the whole album I prefer the songs where Nancy’s voice runs the show. Fortunately that’s most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second track Here I Am sounds a bit like a Pet Shop Boys remix from 20 years ago and I mean that in the best possible way. It would be better if it was more than just a chorus but it’s fun and upbeat. Everything else glides by too: a glib bass riff that could be lifted from Run 2 or Round &amp;amp; Round by New Order illuminates the gentle and insistent Love Stops Here (at about 3:40 in); the gentle attempts to understand a shy lover on You Were A Runaway underpinned with a disco beat; and the delightful relationship tongue twisters of I’ve Waited So Long backed by 80s beats that evoke shoulder pads and city skylines at night. These songs all drift by supported with the galaxial twinkle of synth, house beats, and vocal coos. It is pop music with a dance twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often write about how albums are front loaded with the best songs but on In A Dream The Juan Maclean save the two best songs for last. A Simple Design pits a witty verse-chorus-verse lyric to a similar dance-pop design as the rest of the album, while The Sun Will Never Set On Our Love is a remarkable ten minute song that seems to rush by in three or four. It ends with a repeated mantra of send it in a rocket ship / send it out to space / racing past the stratosphere / we’ll leave without a trace which ties the album back to where it started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In A Dream isn’t as cool as the LCD Soundsystem albums but is just as fun and wears its influences transparently and well. It’s entertaining and I will certainly keep on listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vessel-punish-honey&quot;&gt;Vessel &lt;em&gt;Punish, Honey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vessel is the &lt;em&gt;nom de vacarme&lt;/em&gt; of Bristol-based musician Sebastian Gainsborough. Punish, Honey is his second album. I haven’t listened to the other one yet. It is allegedly constructed from homemade instruments, though I haven’t been able to find out whether these were electronic instruments, or acoustic instruments that were then sampled and used as found sound. Whichever way around, and even if this weren’t the case, Punish, Honey is still a remarkable album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins inauspiciously with Febrile that sounds exactly how detractors of electronic music sourced from found sound might imagine. It’s a couple of crashes of metal and then some drill-like and siren-like noises. It’s pretentious and unnecessary, but it serves well as a pallette cleanser for what follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Sex is my favourite piece of music I’ve heard so far this year. It’s a driving throbbing relentless piece - all brute and yet also all machine - with an incredible sawing high pitch riff caterwauling over the top. You can almost sing along, so long as you are confident that whining EE OO EE-OO EE-OO-OO-OO EE-OO as you walk down the street isn’t going to get you sectioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drowned In Water and Light is all drama and darkness, perfectly controlled and poised throughout. Euoi is perhaps the only track I don’t absoloutely love, but there’s a busyness beneath the dissonance that I am starting to appreciate as I listen to the album over and over. Then, just when you think the album is all thumps and slams, dissonance and pain, a huge melody breaks out on Anima which gives things a real shot in the arm half way through. It’s not quite as good as Red Sex but it stops the album from becoming too self-absorbed. The next track Black Leaves and Dead Branches is a slow spooky track built around what sounds like a (presumably homemade) dub melodica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punish, Honey is not the easiest listen but it’s far more accessible than I was expecting (or than Febrile lets on). It’s dark and fun. Think Fuck Buttons with a few more rough edges. It seems more innovative than the Aphex Twin album, which perhaps emphasises my point about where new music is now, but Aphex’s music is as much the start point for this album as it is for SYRO. Perhaps that doesn’t matter, what’s more important is that there are fantastic albums like this out there. Give it a go, you might be surprised at how much you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to generate random numbers in R</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/generate-random-numbers-in-r"/>
   <updated>2014-09-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/generate-random-numbers-in-r</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post deals with how to generate random numbers in R. It is good to know how to generate random numbers with a particular language or software package for at least one of the following three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to test something that depends on a particular distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re running a stochastic process of some kind (Branching process, random walk etc) and you need random numbers for deciding whether an event occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You forgot to pick your lottery numbers this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s step through doing each of these with R. Over time I will write this post out again for C++, Java, Python, and Ruby. This post is just a memory aid that I can use later on and is not meant as anything more rigorous than that. As such it is a living document, I will mutate this post in place as and when I need to. Memory aids are useful for when you haven’t used a particular programming language or software package for a while. Who knows, it might save me a couple of searches with DuckDuckGo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-generate-random-numbers-in-r-from-a-particular-distribution&quot;&gt;How to generate random numbers in R from a particular distribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally there would be one central random number generating function and you would pass it the distribution you need along with your parameters. R appears to have separate functions for each distribution, which is a bit annoying, but at least they are (fairly) sensibly named. Here’s a table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distribution you need values from&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample R command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Normal&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;rnorm()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Uniform&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;runif()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Exponential&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;rexp()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Poisson&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;rpois()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Negative Binomial&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;rnbinom()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that for each distribution &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt;, the name of that function that generates random numbers from &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;rdist&lt;/code&gt;. There are also functions &lt;code&gt;ddist&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pdist&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;qdist&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;ddist&lt;/code&gt; will return the height of the pdf, &lt;code&gt;pdist&lt;/code&gt; will return the cdf, and &lt;code&gt;qdist&lt;/code&gt; will give the inverse cdf (the quantiles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s annoying that there is no clear way that the names of the distributions become the stem at the heart of those d-, p-, q-, and r- functions. Is it the first four letters? No, it’s the first three letters for the exponential distribution and (not the first) five letters for the negative binomial distribution. (And the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; name when you start looking at things like the Weibull distribution.) Obviously you learn the names after you use them for a while. And to repeat, it is also strange that you can’t pass the name of a distribution (or your own pdf) to a more generic function. Mind you, such generic functions would have to handle the gamut of idiosyncrasies of different probability distributions. Maybe it is better this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will add more distributions later. It will also be useful to work out how to generate samples from my own pdfs. I will add instructions for this later. There are also tests to checking hypotheses that data follow a particular distribution and I will add instructions for this in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generating-random-numbers-for-change-of-state&quot;&gt;Generating random numbers for change of state&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often this is simply a case of generating uniform random numbers in [0,1]. You can use &lt;code&gt;runif(1)&lt;/code&gt; because 0.0 and 1.0 are the default values for &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;runif&lt;/code&gt;. The seed changes each time you start R. If you need to use the same seed to repeat previous work, you can use the &lt;code&gt;set.seed&lt;/code&gt; function before using &lt;code&gt;runic&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Random.html&quot;&gt;Check out the R man page for Random Number Generation&lt;/a&gt; for more detail. This always feels like something that I should know more thoroughly, yet every time I come to random number generation I skim the literature to convince myself it works and then I leave it at that. Generally I tend to stick to the state of the art in what happens to ‘just work’ and then hammer that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll add other techniques that use other distributions later. I think particularly of the negative binomial distribution but I want to write a separate post about that a later date. When I write that post I’ll add the relevant R code to this post (and the Java to the Java post, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generating-your-lottery-numbers&quot;&gt;Generating your lottery numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lottery is a mug’s game, but you definitely won’t win if you never play. (Technically if you don’t play you can’t lose, and lotteries set you up to lose: the clue is in the name.) Nevertheless, for special occasions when you might want to quickly generate lottery numbers, or N integers in some other range, you should use &lt;code&gt;sample(6,1:49)&lt;/code&gt; for your lucky ticket, or &lt;code&gt;sample(numSamples,low:high)&lt;/code&gt; for the more general case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-notes&quot;&gt;Other notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also goes without saying that it’s a great idea to use the amazing help in R.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Evie Wyld, All The Birds, Singing</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/all-the-birds-singing"/>
   <updated>2014-09-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/all-the-birds-singing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading &lt;em&gt;All The Birds, Singing&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eviewyld.com&quot;&gt;Evie Wyld&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about a woman called Jake who lives alone on a farm with a dog called Dog on an island somewhere off the coast of Britain. She has sheep to look after but something keeps coming in the middle of the night to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the narrative on the island moves forward in the present, a second narrative peels off backwards to explain her past. This takes place in Australia. Jake is still working with sheep but there is a confrontation with a fellow farmhand who threatens to expose a secret from her past. As this second strand unfurls, we begin to see why Jake is jumpy and convinced that the deaths of her sheep represent ill-portent. However, because this second story rolls backwards in jumps, we have to wait until the end for the terrible events that set her on this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyld uses the two narratives to drive the plot and it does a good job at keeping you reading. The structure is one I’ve encountered before in Iain M. Banks’ &lt;em&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/em&gt; where it is used to devastating effect. The secret at the heart of “All The Birds, Singing” does not quite have the same impact as a chair made of bone, but this protects the plot from being overwhelmed by the device and appearing contrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voyage into Jake’s past is dark one, though it is brightened by comic episodes and the strong character of Jake who you are always rooting for. Meanwhile the action in the present grinds a little at first, but picks up pace in later chapters so that past to present and back again happens in a blur of pages. The story of what is happening to Jake’s sheep is a red herring, there’s no reason for it given within the pages of the novel (sorry for the minor spoiler) and for some readers this might be a disappointment. However, because of how the novel is constructed, the payoff for the reader is finding out what happened in her past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good novels tend to have a big idea at their core. In &lt;em&gt;All The Birds, Singing&lt;/em&gt; the big idea at play is how our memories become crystallised in our past and protected by us, to be endlessly revisited and protected from others who might challenge them. Jake is shown in the present time line to be phoning her family but is never able to say anything. You get the impression that she seeks forgiveness but at the same time denies it to herself. The fact that the time line in the present is unresolved by the end of the novel and that it is so sketchy points to how we need time to process and develop our memories. We are so often defined by things that occur in the heat of a moment, and it takes a long time for the wounds to heal and for scars to form. Eventually we live with our wounds and scars because there is no other option and &lt;em&gt;All The Birds, Singing&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent description of that process.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, August 2014</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2014"/>
   <updated>2014-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The album digest returns with five albums by four artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karl Hyde &amp;amp; Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Someday World&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;HIGH-LIFE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lone &lt;em&gt;Reality Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FKA twigs &lt;em&gt;LP1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mogwai &lt;em&gt;Come On Die Young: Appendix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;karl-hyde--brian-eno-someday-world--high-life&quot;&gt;Karl Hyde &amp;amp; Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Someday World&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;HIGH-LIFE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of both Karl Hyde’s work with Underworld and of Brian Eno’s stuff so Someday World seemed like a dream collaboration to me when it was released last May. I was a bit underwhelmed by it, to the point of overlooking it for &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-may-2014/&quot;&gt;May’s album digest&lt;/a&gt;. Last month they released a follow-up called High-Life, which includes some of the more experimental tracks they’d worked on. Together the two albums are greater than the some of their parts, so I’m writing about both of them together this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday World is improved with the hindsight that High-Life offers but it was a pretty decent album to begin with. It is song-based and so I assume that Brian Eno’s influence is more hidden in the details and it is these that emerge in High-Life, which is looser and more jam-based. Anyway there are some cracking songs on Someday World, it just runs out of steam toward the end. “The Satellites” would have graced any of the last four Underworld albums, “Daddy’s Car” is a sweet bit of summery nostalgia, and “Witness” demonstrates that all those spoken word sequences on Underworld records weren’t entirely down to Rick Smith after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-Life offers longer tracks and just one full-blown song, “Cells &amp;amp; Bells”, which closes the album. Instead there’s the upbeat and funky “DBF” with its sinuous guitar riff that’s ripe for a remix by someone like Daphni and the gorgeous nine minute stretch of “Lilac”, which is one of those gorgeous open-ended pieces that Underworld used to be so fond of making before they went all pop on Barking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a good pair of albums that complement each other - after listening to High-Life you can appreciate the more technical aspects of Someday World that are hidden by the more conventional songwriting. Meanwhile Someday World helps invest the more abstract moments of High-Life with emotional meaning. They aren’t quite complementary but each certainly enhances the other. Could they be compressed into a single album? Probably not. By releasing two, Karl Hyde and Brian Eno have given us the best of both worlds without making too many artistic compromises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lone-reality-testing&quot;&gt;Lone &lt;em&gt;Reality Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like Lone’s music but I have no idea how to write about it so this may be a rather short review. I had the same problem with his last album “Galaxy Garden” in 2012, I loved it and listened to it loads but despite plans to write about it, I never managed to find the way to write about it in an album digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would describe the music on “Reality Testing” as being a bit like a Mondrian painting - Lone abstracts dance music into something so structured and polished that you can’t help but admire it, much in a way that Mondrian’s compositions turn painting into something algebraic and modern. Nevertheless it’s very hard to explain what a Mondrian painting &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;expresses&lt;/em&gt;, and I find the same to be true of Lone’s music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything sounds like a million dollars. There are huge diving synth sweeps, housy piano licks, muscular hip-hop beats, even the tropes of drum’n’bass. It’s all glossy and warm, like something that should soundtrack footage of a trendy holiday destination. I always see Lisbon or San Francisco’s trams when I listen to tracks like “Restless City”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of easy references to spot, like the Future Sound Of London on “Aurora Northern Quarter”, and The Go Team on “2 is 8”. The centrepiece “Airglow Fires” is as smart and sensible a piece of dance music as you could wish for, aimed square at the dance floor and good times like a slightly less frenetic Disclosure track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, I like this, it’s so perfect and well-made, but it’s hard to actually describe the emotion involved. Perhaps eventually I’ll grok it better, perhaps no one is meant to. Perhaps it is just enough to enjoy it and why not, “Reality Testing” certainly is an enjoyable album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fka-twigs-lp1&quot;&gt;FKA twigs &lt;em&gt;LP1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a month or so I am still not sure about twigs’ début album LP1. I am convinced it’s a unique sounding album and it has to be commended for its daring approach. The way she flits from dirty talk on “Two Weeks” to cooing sweetly on “Pendulum” demonstrates that she has a lot of ground she can cover. Nonetheless it’s also uneven, perhaps by design, and at first all the trapdoor beats and pitch-shifted vocals make it hard to settle in close to the songs and enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to LP1 made me think about how my relationship to new music has changed in recent years. This album has come along much hyped and I found it quite disappointing at first: I thought of it as a mere re-tread of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/01/tricky-maxinquaye-reissue-review&quot;&gt;Tricky’s Maxinequaye nearly twenty years on&lt;/a&gt; but without any of the eccentricities that made Tricky’s debut seem so new and dangerous. But what if it seemed that way because I was young and naïve? Perhaps I am too old for this sort of thing. Her tunes are postmodern and deconstructed, all shiny and new, and that has always been a young person’s game. However the ideas underpinning the songs are pretty standard: they’re about sex, fame, and ennui. Saying what’s been said before but with sleeker, trendier, beats doesn’t automatically make something interesting or valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact when she swings closer to existing records and doesn’t try so hard she has more success. “Numbers” is a fantastic song that sounds &lt;a href=&quot;http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/6570/&quot;&gt;like early Portishead&lt;/a&gt; and as it progresses she starts to break down all its elements. With a decent tune and a reference point, it’s easier to understand her experiments with the beats and the voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs crammed with crazier ideas are worth persevering with. “Two Weeks” throws everything at you as though twigs has everything to prove: think of an X Factor audition performed with music production software rather than vocal histrionics. When she duets with a chipmunked version of herself on “Closer” it makes no sense in terms of the song but it does sound really cool. “Kicks” introduces more chipmunks while also incorporating mutant samples of her voice into the backing track, this is probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mh63&quot;&gt;what Björk was going for with Medulla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I am not sure about this album. It’s possible that in a year’s time I will completely understand all these songs and know them inside and out but it will obviously take a while for them all to bed down. I think it’s worth sticking with. I do believe in twigs as an artist and I don’t think I would have bothered to mention Tricky, Portishead, and Björk if I didn’t. I predict that LP2 will be better than LP1 and once she’s pinned down her sound, I think she will write fantastic songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mogwai-come-on-die-young-appendix&quot;&gt;Mogwai &lt;em&gt;Come On Die Young: Appendix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My beautiful vinyl box set of the Come On Die Young remaster finally arrived and, as promised, here are some notes on the bonus material, or “appendix” as the box would have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the two songs that I’d not heard before “Nick Drake” and “Hugh Dallas”. I think they’ve been released before but I’d not heard them. “Nick Drake” sounds a lot like other tracks on CODY, perhaps a little more chilled, I think it was dropped from the track list quite late. It opens the appendix album and I think this makes me think of it fitting well near the start of CODY, perhaps nestled in between the title track and “Helps Both Ways”. “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Dallas&quot;&gt;Hugh Dallas&lt;/a&gt;” is longer and more open-ended, certainly more subtle than any of the longer tracks on the album proper, it has a soft vocal and I think it’s even better than “cody”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demo of “Helps Both Ways” is included and features its original American Football sample that didn’t get cleared for the album, it includes the line “he helps both ways” and explains the title. Personally I prefer the album version for all the reasons I gave in my &lt;a href=&quot;/uc26/&quot;&gt;understated classics post&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere the other demos for tracks that later appeared on CODY are almost all more muted than the finished versions and demonstrate the fantastic job the band did with Dave Friedman on opening up the tracks and making them more expansive - the demos feel flatter and without as much space. Sometimes they are more melodic, as with the version of “Ex-Cowboy” in which the quiet-loud dynamics of the finished track barely appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also good to have the tracks from the “Travels In Constants EP” again as I lost my copy a while back, I think it was a loan made permanent somewhere. “Arundel” is creepy and stately, all piano and effects pedal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the material in the appendix is far better than I was expected it to be and makes for almost as good a listen as its parent album. You get so many reissues where the bonus material is an afterthought but here it’s a delight to listen to. I’m really glad that I invested in the box set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-digest-august-2014---digested&quot;&gt;Album Digest August 2014 - Digested&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a playlist of this month’s albums so that you can listen along at home. It sounds pretty good shuffled; the Mogwai tracks stand out a bit but they are older than the others (and demos at that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month will definitely feature an album called “Punish, Honey” by Vessel. I’ve heard a track from it called “Red Sex” and it is amazing. I will probably write about “LOSE” by Cymbals Eat Guitars too because there is a dearth of quality guitar rock at the moment and “LOSE” sounds pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Haruki Murakami, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki And His Years Of Pilgrimage</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki"/>
   <updated>2014-08-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki And His Years Of Pilgrimage is the latest novel by Haruki Murakami. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/19/haruki-murakami-marketing-publishers-stickers&quot;&gt;It comes with free stickers&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps that tells you everything you need to know about this book, which is slimmer than Murakami’s recent efforts. The plot begins with an intriguing premise. Tsukuru is part of a group of close friends and is one day expelled from the group for no reason. Unfortunately, the development of the plot is uncontrolled and by the end  of novel too many holes have developed for it all to hold together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasant read but a familiar one. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.incidentalcomics.com/2012/06/haruki-murakami-bingo.html&quot;&gt;You can play Murakami bingo&lt;/a&gt; with Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki. Will there be Jazz or classical music? (Or, potential spoiler, both?) Will the character at the centre of the action make pasta? Or drink &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutty-sark.com/the-whisky/&quot;&gt;Cutty Sark whisky&lt;/a&gt;? Will they have an infatuation from childhood that will haunt their adult life? Will a strange dream-like world enter into our reality at some point? Will the books that Murakami’s been reading all-too-obviously force their way in to the narrative at some point? Will there be an endearing cat simile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read a lot of Murakami novels, you won’t need to re-read it when you are done, and if you haven’t, well I can suggest at least three better books with similar plots that you will probably enjoy more than Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murakami’s last novel “1Q84” was so huge that it had to be split into three books. It too was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story&quot;&gt;shaggy dog story&lt;/a&gt; that became a love story at the end. It even had a happy ending. It also had a variant of almost all the Murakami bingo elements. For example, a chapter called “The town of the cats” manages to hit peak cat. As I mentioned above because “1Q84” was longer, there was enough space to resolve most of the plot points. In Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki there are plot points that are completely unresolved by the end of the novel. In some ways this mirrors the unresolution of the whole novel but it feels lazy and cynical, unless there is the possibility of a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe that Murakami should be cut some slack for the ingeniously blank prose that is able to endow the slightest deviation from normality with a shivery strangeness, then there is a little more for you here than for the rest of us. Even so, it still doesn’t come close to the utterly bonkers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17800.Dance_Dance_Dance&quot;&gt;“Dance Dance Dance”&lt;/a&gt; or the slow strange unfolding of his masterpiece &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/26/daily/bird-book-review.html&quot;&gt;“The Wind-up Bird Chronicle”&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways the whole thing feels like two novellas fighting it out to be a novel: one a realistic story about friendship, time, and memory; the other a surreal concoction about spirit colours, demonic jazz pianists, soul murder and how the world connects to the realm of dreams. In my favourite Murakami novel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.conceptualfiction.com/hardboiled_wonderland.html&quot;&gt;“Hard-boiled Wonderland and The End Of The World”&lt;/a&gt; he has the same problem and solves it simply by presenting the two stories completely separated from one another and in parallel. “1Q84” just about managed to pull off a fusion of these two styles, but in a tighter framework Murakami just can’t do it this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Useful Ulysses</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/useful-ulysses"/>
   <updated>2014-08-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/useful-ulysses</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-it-is&quot;&gt;What it is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulyssesapp.com&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; editor for the Mac. It has a simple drafting model that makes it easy to organise ideas and move between them. Pieces of writing are represented as sheets that can be tagged and grouped together - the grouping can be made manually or using filters. There are no files, the sheets are entries in a single database that is synced with iCloud. Because everything is plain text it won’t eat up your storage space. Individual sheets can be archived for use with Mac Os X’s versions feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a companion app for iOS called Daedalus Touch that will also sync to iCloud, but I have not tried that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ulysses is full of useful features: when a word count is set a simple indicator tells you whether you have met the target yet. Images can be attached to sheets but I find it easier to deal with images in the WordPress post editor so I have not used this feature a lot. You can easily export to HTML, RTF, PDF, and ePub formats - with the option to preview beforehand. The HTML preview can be copied to the clipboard, which is great for blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-it-helps&quot;&gt;Why it helps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now use Ulysses III to write nearly all of my posts. I use it to start writing anything long form, even if I have to transfer it to another format later (as is the case with blog posts). Because of the grouping features I can keep blog stuff away from other works in progress. Within particular projects Ulysses encourages structure, which is something that I like a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to brainstorm lots of ideas for posts. I set up multiple sheets in a group and type out the titles, while sketching out notes and details as markdown comments. Because my ideas are arranged into groups (by theme, whether research is required, etc), I can make sure my posts are varied&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in terms of subject and depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word count targets make sure that I write enough for each post (and help me to identify quick wins in posts that are nearly finished). The export feature introduces another chance to edit into the writing process, so I feel like my writing is getting checked more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because almost every feature can be accessed from the keyboard, time spent in the app is mostly spent with your hands down typing not rooting for some buried feature in the menu system or tapping some icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;any-drawbacks&quot;&gt;Any drawbacks?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ulysses III doesn’t implement Mac OS X’s system-wide autocorrect and the spell check doesn’t show mistakes as you type. This might not be the worst drawback because you can still check through words at the end, besides there’s nothing more frustrating than when OS X decides to change a word that you are typing when you are still halfway through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that it is a shame that you can’t export comments to HTML. Most of the time you don’t need outline comments in finished code but it would be useful if I could export various metadata to WordPress in the form of comments. I have asked the developers whether they might consider a toggle in the settings and they responded quickly to say that they’d consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my other minor problems are ones of how to better manage moving what I write from Ulysses over to WordPress but even so I think the process is already as frictionless as it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be amazing if someone were to write a Ulysses-style LaTeX editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got it half price and that was about the right price for its usefulness. This means that at the moment it is about twice the price that it really should be. By anyone’s definition that makes it expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-this-an-ad&quot;&gt;Is this an ad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really, I am just sharing the tools that I use for creating things. I also wanted to share what I like about software that I use regularly, so that I am more aware of those things in future. I’ve deliberately not used any of their logos in the hero image, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/aoXziY&quot;&gt;ULYSSES&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/stop1er/&quot;&gt;Fedor Ø&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;(cc-by-nc-sa-2.0)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #27: A Ghost Is Born by Wilco</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-27"/>
   <updated>2014-08-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-27</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;whatever-happened-to-that-hat&quot;&gt;I have already given some of the personal background to why I love this album&lt;/a&gt; and now it’s time to give a bit of love to the music itself so I’ll stick to giving a track by track account of “A Ghost Is Born”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Wilco’s first few albums, you’ll know that A Ghost Is Born is on the line of best fit through Being There, Summerteeth, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. It continues its predecessor’s experimentation, but also gets reined in a little. Great songs - some of my favourite Wilco songs - were left off Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bemydemon.org/songs/venus.htm&quot;&gt;Venus Stopped The Train&lt;/a&gt;”, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://wilcoworld.net/#!/song/a-magazine-called-sunset/&quot;&gt;A Magazine Called Sunset&lt;/a&gt;”) so the follow-up could easily have been more of the same and everyone would have gone home happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is to Wilco’s credit then that they set out push the envelope again. It is not quite the shock to the system that Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was, but nor is it the hangover that early reviews first implied. If Yankee… demonstrated that a modern Wilco was possible, then for the most part A Ghost Is Born takes the baton and runs with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-purple-black-eye&quot;&gt;Your purple-black eye&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opener “At Least That’s What You Said” pulls no punches, there’s no slurred wordplay as with “I’m Trying To Break Your Heart” — here the damage has already been done, the heart already is broken, the narrator nurses a black eye, and both the people in the song need some time alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musically it’s beautifully reserved, a minimal backing holding back until two minutes in when a squall of guitars come through&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and lay the real emotional trauma at the heart of the song bare before your ears. It is one of those beautiful songs (like “Dance Yourself Clean” by LCD Soundsystem) that tricks you into turning it up because it starts so quietly, and then BAM BAM BAM the guitar solo gets you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hell is Chrome” — the song that indirectly gave this blog its name, as you are no doubt tired of hearing by now — is a more sedate affair. It tells of the devil coming to the song’s narrator and not being red, but chrome, and offering the world’s clean surfaces as a special kind of hell. Again the guitar solos scrape across the song midway through to take the place of a chorus but it doesn’t happen again throughout the record so we’ll forgive them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-good-to-be-alone&quot;&gt;It’s good to be alone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was genuinely shocked the first time I ever heard “Spiders (kidsmoke)”, it is such a departure compared to their previous work. As for when they played it live, that totally blew me away. It’s a ten minute piece of motorik riffing that would sound more in place on a Neu! or a CAN record. It was very strange to hear it played within twenty minutes of “California Stars”. I think the best thing about it is that they’ve never revisited that sound (perhaps “Art of Almost” on “The Whole Love” comes close) so it always sounds new and strange, and the weird lyrics about “all these telescopic poems”, “spiders… filling out tax returns… on a private beach in Michigan” and “I just do what I am told” just make it all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison the gentle sweep of “Muzzle of bees” zips by in a blur, something like a gentler and less consequential “Jesus, etc”, so that I often hardly notice it (but I always enjoy it when I do). “Hummingbird” shows of Jeff Tweedy’s affection for White Album era McCartney songs, it’s pretty much “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_My_Dear&quot;&gt;Martha My Dear&lt;/a&gt;” recast as Americana with some proper lyrics that McCartney couldn’t be bothered to put into the original&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-was-chewing-gum-as-something-to-do&quot;&gt;I was chewing gum as something to do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Handshake Drugs” completes the section of “straight” songs that make up the middle of A Ghost Is Born. Unlike the very earnest songs of Yankee… (“I’m the Man Who Loves You”, “Kamera”), these are very downcast and understated, none more so than “Handshake Drugs” which puts a blank smile on the face of a song about prescription drug abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album’s beautiful ambient core is “Wishful Thinking”, a straight-up ode to the beauty of knowledge that tinkles the ivories and gently coos. There’s some lovely lines in there, I particularly like “The turntable sizzles / Casting the spells” and I adore how it mixes up sadness, thirst for knowledge, and romance all in to one beautiful song. Looking closer at the lyrics I understand now why “Panthers” was not included on the album and later issued as a bonus track - it overlaps lyrically with “Wishful Thinking”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Company In My Back” is a great little song, one of many Wilco songs that take a quirky lyrical idea and glues it to a quirky riff. It’s going around my head as I think of it now and of course the lyric “I will always die so you can remember me” fits in very well with the album’s title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ill-lay-it-down-a-ghost-is-born&quot;&gt;I’ll lay it down, a ghost is born&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m A Wheel” is a pallette-cleansing bit of punky noise, a song that dislodged the similar sounding “Kicking Television” from the track list. Both tracks are pretty inconsequential and I wonder if “Kicking Television” didn’t come along too late to be on the album (it was played for the first time at the Portsmouth gig) because I think it’s the better song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then along comes “Theologians” with all its anti-religious bluster “Theologians… don’t know nothing about my soul” and the repeated chorus of “a ghost is born”. The end refrain of “I’m a cherry ghost” lends a surreal aspect to the song and yet somehow makes complete sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fill-up-your-mind-with-all-it-can-know&quot;&gt;Fill up your mind with all it can know&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next track “Less Than You Think” lasts for fifteen minutes. It begins with the line “Your mind’s a machine, deadly and dull…” and continues to relate a metaphor about migraines, before it collapses into a drone just after three minutes in. Conceptually that is very interesting but it makes for a rather dull listen once you’ve got the idea sorted in your head. I ripped about four minutes from the CD and that was enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album ends with “&lt;a href=&quot;http://wilcoworld.net/#!/song/the-late-greats/&quot;&gt;The Late Greats&lt;/a&gt;”, a great song that was apparently added to the track listing at the last minute. It has a wonderful throwaway sound to it and it’s very straightforward, yet somehow it would not sit as perfectly as it does on any other Wilco album. It’s a beautiful chiming song about the ephemeral nature of pop music: “The best songs never get sung / the best laugh never leaves your lungs / it’s so good you will never know / they never even played a show” (a bit like all my “bands”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this album: its sentiments, its confusion and most of all some cracking guitar solos. As I said &lt;a href=&quot;whatever-happened-to-that-hat&quot;&gt;when I wrote about that hat&lt;/a&gt;, I first encountered this album while in a foggy state in my life and its feints and dead ends, its heart and head, all served to draw me in. The ghost in the machine, the soul in the body. The long-lasting light.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Yes, another squall. Just like number 27. And I note the fact that I’m following up a review of “Come On Die Young” with one of “A Ghost Is Born”. I don’t plan it like this, honest. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No wonder Lennon and McCartney fell out: John takes a load of drugs and explores the life of the mind, Paul stays at home to learn musique concrete and write songs about a shaggy Old English Sheepdog. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>South America, Part 10</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-10"/>
   <updated>2014-08-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-10</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/south-america-trip-part-9/&quot;&gt;Picking up where I left off&lt;/a&gt; at Machu Picchu, we headed down into Aguas Calientes (trans. “hot waters”) by coach and by the time we got there it was torrenting down with rain. So much for exploration. We waited out the downpour in a pizza place and deliberated over whether to buy souvenier snaps from the tour guides. Ironically for a town named after hot waters, it was bitterly cold. One of those places where the sound of running water follows you wherever you go, the best thing about it was the huge trains that ran down the middle of street - big clanking hulks pulling huge passenger trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took one of those trains back to Cusco, though darkness fell about 30 minutes in. Enough time to see the rain’s effect on the Urubamba river, now a raging torrent filled with peculiar eddies and whorls. I fell asleep to the sound of my mp3 player despite the piped in Peruvian music and the coach being as bright as day. We transferred back to Cuzco in a stuffy coach that smelled of feet. I can’t even remember going out to dinner once we got back: I’m not certain that I did. All I remember is washing about a week’s worth of dirt off me in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we were up and off to Puno. This involved a transfer complete with Men At Work’s “Down Under” blaring out, a stern talk about drugs from our new driver, and another trip through the delights of Juliaca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puno doesn’t look like much, save for the fact that Lake Titicaca is so huge you’d be forgiven for thinking that it was a seaside town. Another transfer and we were in another reasonable hotel. I dropped in some laundry and we went to the markets to buy fruit for the families we were due to stay with on the Uros Islands in the middle of the lake. Despite not being that pretty, Puno is nevertheless an interesting place. Perhaps because it is “close” to the border with Bolivia, there are loads of electronics shops. There is a real mania for massive speakers. And then, on the way to the markets, a huge procession of chaps in bowler hats comes marching by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is close to Lake Titicaca, Puno does at least have some nice restaurants and we settled in for a nice dinner. I headed back to the hotel early because I was tired and the next day I felt the same so I signed off the tour with the intention of resting for the day and heading out to the reed islands the following day. Two fellow travellers Maz and Luke did  the same because Maz was sick. The three of us booked a boat trip for the following day and had dinner together before we snuggled up to watch the recent Doctor Who specials on their laptop. Never underestimate the power of a day of doing nothing that culminates in watching the Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I felt much better and Luke and I (unfortunately Maz was still unwell) took our trip out to the reed islands. We’d had the opportunity to go out to more islands and be back by six but had instead opted for a shorter trip that meant we would be back before lunch. As it happened this turned out to be a pretty good idea. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fine sunny day and we headed out to the islands to meet the locals who explained the construction of the reed islands. These were not people who had always lived this way, the reed islands are very much a post-colonial invention by people seeking to escape the genocidal Spanish&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Nowadays families still live on floating islands on the lake and make most of their living from tourism. The islands have to be constantly regenerated with new reeds and you can certainly smell them rotting. Nevertheless thanks to solar panels it is at least possible to watch TV!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned to Puno with no sign that the weather was about to change. We checked in on Maz, collected laundry, bought a birthday present for Jerry, went to lunch and had pizza. All this before the remainder of the group got back from their homestay. Almost as soon as they had, a great storm came in with great buckets of hail. And several power cuts. We sat in the candlelit lobby and drank chamomile tea. The hotel was on an incline, so we could see the streets flooding into streams and then hail began floating past too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told that Puno was our last chance to eat cuy (guinea pig) as it would no longer be served once we reached Bolivia. I declined the chance - I’d arrived as people received theirs and to be honest it did just look like a greasy dead rat on a plate, so I opted for chicken milanese instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we headed off for La Paz via Tiwanaku. The border crossing was very easy, lots of form filling but very little drama. Between the border and La Paz, lake Titicaca seemed to stretch all the way, a vast inland sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped off at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku&quot;&gt;Tiwanaku&lt;/a&gt;, a vast pre-Colombian pre-Incan archeological site that we had to tour in a hurry due to being a little behind schedule. This was another place I’d seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pyfwc&quot;&gt;“Lost Kingdoms of South America”&lt;/a&gt; TV show that had inspired me to take the trip in the first place. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p013qqb8&quot;&gt;Here’s a clip about Tiwanaku on the BBC website.&lt;/a&gt;) It was very strange and yet somehow because we were rushed, I didn’t feel like I got as much out of seeing it as I did Ingapirca or Chan Chan. One to go back to I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the truck we arrived in La Paz shortly before dark. We saw figures hanging from the lampposts, it was rather sinister but they are in fact tokens that are set on fire at midnight on New Year’s Eve to burn away the bad things that have happened in the previous year. No more weird than Guy Fawkes dolls but rather creepy when you see them without knowing what they are. We actually got a bit lost and drove through a market teeming with people selling all manner of goods, it was great to see everyone’s reaction to the truck. I especially liked how young children got incredibly excited and would wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We transferred to the hotel in La Paz on what we affectionately referred to as the “death bus” (theme tune remarkably similar to batman). Our hotel room had been the site of a recent 50th birthday celebration and had been, shall we say, lightly cleaned in the interim. Nevertheless we headed out to a dutch cafe called Sol y Luna to hear a presentation about cycling down the death road. I decided that it was not for me - at least not with another four months or so to go, I didn’t really want to break any limbs until I was almost due to fly home! I had an amazing ghoulash for dinner, probably the best thing I’d eaten since Heidi’s in Cuzco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday (New Year’s Eve), I explored La Paz with several people from the truck who had not gone on the death road bike ride. This included wandering through the witches’ market with the weird dessicated animal embryos hanging in the roof (people bury them under houses to bring luck) and bizarre boxes of alleged powders and potions (the majority of which were concerned with endowing sexual prowess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La Paz is pretty much crammed with market stalls all along the streets. As with most South American capitals, the old jostles with the new, the rich with the poor. We had been warned that La Paz was dangerous but I saw little that worried me. I also went with Jerry to the contemporary art museum, which was fun, though the art seemed to be more surreal than contemporary. That said, there were some tempting pieces for sale and had I been on sabbatical I probably would have bought one. Again, something to do next time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For new year’s eve, we returned to Sol y Luna and partied with the Dutch until well past midnight. I had a good old dance (one of only a few times that I did on the whole tour, to my shame) and really enjoyed myself. I got up too late for the hotel breakfast (as did everybody else) and so we went looking for food elsewhere. It took a while to find a place that was actually open (so much so we ended up back at the same place for dinner later on in the day) and we settled in for various sandwiches and in my case a virtuous bowl of meusli and fruit yoghurt&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful to be somewhere different for New Year’s Day, and with four months of the tour ahead of me I didn’t feel like I had to make any resolutions. I felt good in La Paz, like I was finally getting to grips with the adventure. Not that there was actually much adventure to be had that day: La Paz on the 1st of January was totally dead. The bustling jostling market stalls of the day before were practically empty save for a few DVD hawkers. It was even difficult trying to find somewhere to have a coffee. Not that we minded, most of the afternoon we sat in the hotel lobby and watched the Bond movie “Quantum of Solace”, which is partly set in Bolivia (though it was shot in Chile, much to local chagrin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_10/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our peregrinations and feeling the effects of the night before, we went to bed early ready for an early transfer back to the truck. The next stop on the tour would be a high point, literally: the high altitude mining town of Potosí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that the Spanish would not overtly kill the natives but ‘recruit’ them for almost certain death in the silver mines around Potosi, more on that in part 11. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; virtuous, you can just about make out the enormous cup of coffee in the background! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What IS That Noise?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/what-is-that-noise"/>
   <updated>2014-08-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/what-is-that-noise</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently spruced up a post I wrote four years ago about &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/uc4/&quot;&gt;Biosphere’s wonderful album Substrata&lt;/a&gt;. I added the following footnote about the difference between voice samples and found sound:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I suppose I am distinguishing between found sound and vocal samples here. Perhaps there is very little difference, or that one is the other? When is a vocal snippet something more than found sound? Is it the fact that one has meaning? Isn’t a “meaningless” sample - like the ones here in Russian that I can’t understand - little more than found sound anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are rhetorical questions and they have gone unanswered. That’s a shame but I appreciate that the passing traffic for that particular post is quite low, let alone the footnotes. Perhaps we could address them here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And wait! I have more. These are some other similar questions that sprung to mind at the same time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do all human utterances have intention and therefore meaning, even if you haven’t understood it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does all noise have a physical explanation? (Sound is just atoms vibrating after all?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does experiencing the recreation of a physical noise represents a repetition of the event that created the noise, even if it is just an abstract reification&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of that event?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If all experience and knowledge is subjective, would that mean that even meaningless “noise” or “found sound” can have intention, meaning, and purpose?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that for the second question a possible “non-physical noise” might be the memory of one. For example, a song going around in your head&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has no physical basis — “hearing” it does not come from your brain interpreting signals generated in your auditory nerve in response to your eardrum vibrating, though of course neurons are firing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and this does have a physical basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about these ideas for two reasons: one is the ongoing growth of my beautiful niece who continues to develop every time I see her, particularly cognitively. She’s at that wonderful stage where she is talking without any meaning, just that burbling baby-talk that young children use to work out the intonations of speech. The best thing is she can tell the difference between my imitation of her baby-talk (which delights her) and my invention of totally different baby-talk (which confuses her).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is &lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophynow.org/issues/101/Intuition_Pumps_by_Daniel_C_Dennett&quot;&gt;Daniel Dennett’s great book “Intuition Pumps”&lt;/a&gt;, one of about twenty books that I seem to be about a third of the way through at the moment. (I wonder how many of my questions here he might dismiss as mere “deepities”?) He writes at length about viewing systems from the intentional, design, and physical standpoints. These are shorthand for how systems can be condensed so that they considered in an effective manner. If we return to the found sound versus vocal samples debate as an example, we can say that the difference between the two sound sources is that we have to interpret vocal samples from an intentional stance and found sound from a physical stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To come to some sort of conclusion and kind of answer my initial question, I think that found sound and vocal samples are genuinely different instruments on the Substrata album&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; because your brain is interpreting them through these different stances. As to what happens when the language of the vocal sample is foreign to the listener, I don’t think you shift to a different stance but I do think it has a different effect, one that uses the cognitive dissonance between knowing something has meaning without knowing the actual meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reification is the act of realising an idea - such as a building a chair after thinking of something to sit on. Hence “abstract reification” is something of an oxymoron, but one that works in this instance. It’s a fault in my vocabulary for sure: if only there were an adjective for the Proustian recollection of past events . &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SOPHIE’s Lemonade perhaps? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even Beliebers are not brain-dead. Probably. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Other ambient albums are available. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Clarice Lispector, Hour of the Star</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/hour-of-the-star-by-clarice-lispector"/>
   <updated>2014-08-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/hour-of-the-star-by-clarice-lispector</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141392035,00.html?strSrchSql=hour+of+the+star/Hour_of_the_Star_Clarice_Lispector&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hour of the Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a short novel by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarice_Lispector&quot;&gt;Clarice Lispector&lt;/a&gt;, a Ukrainian-born Brazilian author with an interesting life story. This is her last novel and is a remarkable book: inventive, funny, and sad, all at once. I found it in a special selection at the local library dedicated to Brazil because of the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First some biography. Born Chaya Lispector in Chechelnyk, Ukraine, in 1920, her family escaped the pogroms and emigrated to Brazil in 1922. She was given the new name Clarice as the family settled in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-northeast/maceio&quot;&gt;Maceió in north-eastern Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. Later she and her family moved to Rio de Janeiro&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and she started law school there in 1937. Her first published short story appeared around 5 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She later married a diplomat and travelled the world as he conducted various foreign missions. Up until her death at the age of 57, she wrote nine novels. Eight were published in her lifetime and Hour of the Star is the eighth of these. It was published shortly before her death and is the most popular of her novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hour of the Star&lt;/em&gt; is a slip of a book, coming to a total of barely 70 pages. In fact, the edition I borrowed from the library was padded out with a long introduction (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/18/clarice-lispector-hour-of-the-star&quot;&gt;which is the same as this article from the Guardian in February&lt;/a&gt;) and a translator’s note at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel tells the story of Macabéa, a poor woman from the northeast who has had a difficult life and moves to Rio. It would be quite a simple story but the narrator also becomes a character in the story. He keeps interjecting and talking about what is happening, and how useless she is as a character and how much he hates her. Yet somehow by the end of the novel he has lost control of his creation (because she is not his creation but Lispector’s) and all he can do is ponder the nature of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hour of the Star&lt;/em&gt; is a very strange read, an almost intoxicating maelstrom of ideas churning forth on every page. Despite its tiny size, you have to read quickly to get the full effect. It reminded me a lot of a late novel&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by Jack Kerouac called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57902.Vanity_of_Duluoz&quot;&gt;“Vanity of Duluoz”&lt;/a&gt; but also of the album &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5758-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea/&quot;&gt;“In The Aeroplane Over The Sea” by Neutral Milk Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in the sense that in those songs there is a similar tension between the narrator and the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what sets &lt;em&gt;Hour of the Star&lt;/em&gt; apart is that despite the apparent artificiality of how it is written, it manages to be very successful as writing about poverty, which is the true subject of the novel. The narrator represensts the tendency of those who talk about poverty to create examples of poverty rather than to engage sympathetically with actual instances of poverty. The whole novel is permeated with the narrator’s misguided belief that as a poor, tragic girl Macabéa must somehow want more than she has. The delight of this book is that Lispector manages to show its readers their complicity in the delusions of its narrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is a fantastic book and the end-pieces are interesting too. I look forward to reading more of her work if I can. Of particular interest to me is &lt;em&gt;The Passion According to G.H.&lt;/em&gt; because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141197357,00.html?strSrchSql=hour+of+the+star/Passion_According_to_G.H_Clarice_Lispector&quot;&gt;the synopsis&lt;/a&gt; suggests a wry take on organised religion. I will also read Clarice Lispector’s biography &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Why-This-World-Biography-Lispector/dp/0199895821&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why This World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if I can get it at/via the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve been there, it’s great, you should totally go too. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I should definitely return to this at some point: I wrote a whole “album” of song lyrics based on one page of this novel. I think it was page 63, though of course editions change. I’ve lost those lyrics now but it might be fun to find the passage and write some more. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Guardians of the Galaxy: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/guardians-of-the-galaxy-fifteen-observations"/>
   <updated>2014-08-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/guardians-of-the-galaxy-fifteen-observations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt; saw Guardians of the Galaxy today. Here are fifteen observations about the film that may or may not constitute a short review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least two Oscars for &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2014/07/guardians-of-the-galaxy-gamora-101682-101718.jpg&quot;&gt;Best Use Of Body Paint (Green)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.radiotimes.com/namedimage/Karen_Gillan_takes_on_Zoe_Saldana_in_extended_Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_trailer.jpg?quality=85&amp;amp;mode=crop&amp;amp;width=620&amp;amp;height=374&amp;amp;404=tv&amp;amp;url=/uploads/images/original/53103.jpg&quot;&gt;Best Use Of Body Paint (Blue)&lt;/a&gt; are sewn up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chris Pratt basically plays Star Lord as “&lt;a href=&quot;http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Andy_Dwyer&quot;&gt;Andy Dwyer&lt;/a&gt; in space” and this is fine by me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best movie to feature &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etonline.com/movies/148845_bradley_cooper_explains_his_voice_guardians_of_the_galaxy/&quot;&gt;a talking raccoon&lt;/a&gt; in a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://screenrant.com/thor-2-dark-world-mid-post-credits-button-scenes-explained&quot;&gt;Watching the entirety of the end credits of Thor 2&lt;/a&gt; paid off!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“&lt;em&gt;WE&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/dancing-baby-groot-clip-guardians-of-the-galaxy-94738291414.html&quot;&gt;Groot&lt;/a&gt;” — aren’t we just?! All of the feels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It features a dance off as a major event, something that it shares with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_Up_(film_series)&quot;&gt;Step Up movies&lt;/a&gt;. Guardians of the Galaxy is a waaaay better movie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first words of the credits are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mtv.com/news/1887915/guardians-of-the-galaxy-sequel/&quot;&gt;“The Guardians of the Galaxy will return”&lt;/a&gt;. It is in fact a movie that reviews itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 3D version might have been pretty good. I watched the 2D version but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Guardians-Galaxy-Has-Something-Special-Planned-Its-IMAX-3D-43350.html&quot;&gt;the scenes with lots of action &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be improved with a bit of depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11033572/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Awesome-Mix-soundtrack-tops-Billboard-chart.html&quot;&gt;A great soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, but there is a cheesy “smooth rock wins chicks” bit that’s a little icky half way through.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That said, the description of the legend of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087277/&quot;&gt;Footloose&lt;/a&gt; is hilarious. Especially the callback toward the end of the movie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I especially enjoyed the scene with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-easter-eggs-quotes/&quot;&gt;the Collector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karen Gillen is wasted as Nebula, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Nebula-Return-Guardians-Galaxy-2-66648.html&quot;&gt;hopefully she will be back&lt;/a&gt;. Karen’s also in what may well be &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/shows/selfie&quot;&gt;one of the most ill-conceived TV shows of all time&lt;/a&gt; later this autumn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I thought it was Bruce Willis playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatculture.com/wwe/batista-praised-role-guardians-galaxy-movie.php&quot;&gt;Drax the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; (I’m useless at this guess the actor game). I loved his taking things literally: “Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast, I would catch it.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you text me at any point in the next month, I will probably reply with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nerdist.com/2014/08/translate-any-website-into-groot-speak-with-this-nifty-new-button/&quot;&gt;“I am Groot”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No Raccoons or tree creatures were harmed during the making of this film.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>My Amazing Subversive Revolutionary Adolescence</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/my-amazing-subversive-revolutionary-adolescence"/>
   <updated>2014-07-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/my-amazing-subversive-revolutionary-adolescence</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;or-at-least-its-subversive-soundtrack&quot;&gt;Or at least its subversive soundtrack…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to The Orb’s amazing live album “Live ’93” the other day (after discovering the insipid “History Of The Future” collection on Spotify) and I was amazed at how countercultural and subversive it was. I was listening to this stuff at the age of 14 and now that I’m old enough to be a parent, that makes me a bit uncomfortable. Actually it does nothing of the sort, because it’s frigging awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orb were pretty anarchic on record but at their live gigs they went the extra mile, dropping in all the stuff that legal teams can’t clear sample-wise (A mash-up of “The Real Slim Shady” and “Toxygene” when I saw them later on in 2005) and just generally made the tunes baggier and looser. When writing about their second album “U.F.Orb” as part of my understated classic series, I tried to review as many versions of each track as I could, because for The Orb a track is more like a bundle of ideas to extrapolate and explore. Today’s bands don’t do this enough in my opinion. Perhaps the decline of physical formats contributes to this, you just don’t get runs of 200 twelve inches anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the version of “Spanish Castles In Space” on “Live ’93”. The sedate and stately album version sounds like they recorded it in an aquarium. It ends with KLF-esque bleating sheep etc. And the live version barely differs, except for adding a long sample of a news report about a “Marijuana Bomb”. A huge bale of weed tossed out by smugglers lands on someone’s caravan one morning. A huge cheer erupts in the crowd as this sample plays. Later there’s a languid repeated chant of “Marijuana, Marijuana, who wants it?”. It’s a pretty mild celebration of drug use, but it’s a fun reference that I was listening to before I could legally buy cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other subversion abounds (in particular the “morphine drip inside his stomach” sample that darkens those “Little Fluffy Clouds”) and I think it’s telling that “Live ’93” has never been reissued in the way that all the other albums have. In fact it’s so crammed full of samples that it’s a wonder that it ever got released in the first place. There’s a spoken word version of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick In The Wall Part 2” all over “Plateau”. Samples from other Orb tracks are all over the nineteen minute version of “A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain… (Loving U)” turning it into a sort of weird megamix. And what about the Koranic chants sampled on “Outlands” together with Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” speech? (Spoiler alert: it is the ABSOLUTE BEST version of “Outlands” that you will ever hear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But drugs and sampling and religious mysticism? So what? I think the actual subversion of The Orb (and a very small select collection of their peers) was to say “look, come and sit in the garden with us, have a cup of tea, and contemplate the life of the mind”. Look at everything else that’s supposedly rebellious, it’s all just bullshit mind control: drink loads of beer (now all the festivals and music venues are sponsored by drinks companies), have loads of sex (create more minions for the capitalist machine to send off on their pointless tabloid wars), smash stuff up (so we can withdraw from the public good and say that no one can have nice things), etc rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was changed by “Live ’93” (it was the first full length Orb album that I owned) but it didn’t make me take a sack load of drugs, it just gradually evolved me into the sort of person who knows that inward thought and self-reflection are natural and not somehow counter to the spirit of capitalist endeavour. It taught be to be suspicious of humourlessness and ownership. The fast pace of modern life regards things like “hard work”, spontaneity, and branding as innate and inescapable. It requires the sensationalism that I satirised in this post’s title and shies away from the riotous anarchy of the past: what makes me really uncomfortable is whether fourteen-year-olds me can receive these messages today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #26: Come On Die Young by Mogwai</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-26"/>
   <updated>2014-07-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-26</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you about punk rock: punk rock is a word used by dilettantes and ah… and ah… heartless manipulators about music that takes up the energies and the bodies and the hearts and the souls and the time and the minds of young men who give what they have to it and give everything they have to it and it’s a… it’s a term that’s based on contempt, it’s a term that’s based on fashion, style, elitism, satanism and everything that’s rotten about rock ‘n’ roll. I don’t know &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Lydon&quot;&gt;Johnny Rotten&lt;/a&gt; but I’m sure… I’m sure he puts as much blood and sweat into what he does as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud&quot;&gt;Sigmund Freud&lt;/a&gt; did. You see, what sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius, myself . And that music is so powerful that it’s quite beyond my control and ah… when I’m in the grips of it I don’t feel pleasure and I don’t feel pain, either physically or emotionally. Do you understand what I’m talking about? Have you ever felt like that? When you just couldn’t feel anything and you didn’t want to either. You know? Like that? Do you understand what I’m saying sir? (Iggy Pop, Canadian TV, March 11th 1977.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it begins: this sample of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iggypop.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Iggy Pop&lt;/a&gt; sets “Come On Die Young” – the second album by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mogwai.co.uk&quot;&gt;Mogwai&lt;/a&gt; – in motion. It received &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5369-come-on-die-young/&quot;&gt;a lukewarm reception on its release 15 years ago&lt;/a&gt; but to me, it’s a classic. The sentiment of its title, the mellowness, and the stacks of noise that punctuate throughout all combine to make a record that I am fiercely loyal to. It is beautiful and dark and has got better and better with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come On Die Young” is consumed with what happens within the empty spaces in our lives. Even the title is an exhortation to remove the dead space from our lives, to live a life with a similar meaning to those who die young. It’s actually the name of a Glasgow street gang, the album’s title coming from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gangs_in_Glasgow&quot;&gt;the same milleu as their debut “Young Team”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That intro “Punk Rock:”, the title track “cody”, and “Helps Both Ways” – a moody instrumental that feels like the interior of a haunted house, an atmosphere enhanced by the sound of american football commentary – open the album in a slow and stately manner. This tryptych and that jet black cover with the wrong-looking face leering out at you evoke a melancholy fit for rainy days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things surge to life with “Year 2000 Non-Compliant Cardia”, a noisy swinging lilt with the cymbals mixed high and some magnificent effects pedal abuse. It’s pretty and meanacing at the same time. Every time I listen to this album I’m always amazed at how good the drums sound on this album. Next track “Kappa” broods and threatens to erupt but it never does: the odd squall of noise aside, I always think it sounds a bit like a bizarro cover of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/p/pink_floyd/shine_on_you_crazy_diamond_tab.htm&quot;&gt;Pink Floyd’s “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole album explores interstitial spaces: that empty room with the tv on, the rhetoric of the punk rocker echoing out to defend his art to chat show viewers in suburban living rooms, and the tunes that never quite settle in to a rhythm like “Kappa” and “Waltz for Aidan”. It’s all beautifully executed, even if it did non-plus the people enthused by the power and fury of “Young Team”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the album is more noisy, based around four longer pieces (“May Nothing But Happiness Come Through Your Door”, “Ex-Cowboy”, “Chocky” and “Christas Steps”) and two two-minute interludes. “May Nothing But Happiness Come Through Your Door” is nothing short of a masterpiece, it picks up every element of the album to that point and then runs with it while adding one more crucial element: a heartbreaking melody. It is truly the most beautiful piece of post-rock you will ever hear and I own &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the Fridge albums, so I should know. There is also a truly bizzare cymbal sound at points, miked up so every third one is this sort of alien “thwock” and proof, if any were ever needed, that production is as essential to great records as the music itself. Meanwhile we revisit our interstitial spaces: on 6:00 a sample of “please hold the line” begins to repeat as the track gently begins to disappear, until it is the last thing that remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZFlRdEoEuM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh! How the Dogs Stack Up” throws in an interlude of distorted piano and vinyl effects before “Ex-Cowboy” begins the final half hour of “Come On Die Young”: the descent into deep darkness that had been threatened throughout. It’s a track that builds into sheets of noise from the calmest of lulls and then fades back again, several times. This side to the music pushes a button inside me though, or it used to, and the noisier elements used to ratchet up my anger. It’s not always a nice feeling. Over the years though I’ve come to appreciate the structure and I don’t feel quite so tense listening to it. This is just as well because the section of noise that begins around six minutes in sounds like the sound barrier being broken (by guitars!) over and over again. But just like pain and anger, the noisier parts are only temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chocky” begins with a roiling torrent of noise mixed very low beneath a slow piano line, sounding like two records played at once and combining the quiet and loud together. Eventually disembodied voices enter and the noise dominates for a while, before the piano line returns even stronger and the rest of the band enters too. You can still pick out that foam of noise underneath and you’re always held there tense, waiting for it to surge back and take over. However, in a great act of restraint it never does and merely remains there, a quiet whisper of raging feedback that only rises to engulf your headphones and speakers at the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally “Christmas Steps” all but closes the album (“Punk rock/Puff daddy/Antichrist” flips the Iggy Pop sample backwards and deflates into the weary trumpets and noise for a fitting finale) with another beautiful and heartbreaking riff. Around 4:00 a monstrous bass riff takes over, getting quicker and quicker (sounding like Metallica on ketamine - &lt;a href=&quot;http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/mogwai-explain-the-metallica-glastonbury-controversy/&quot;&gt;much like the actual Metallica did at Glastonbury a few weeks back&lt;/a&gt;) before a real raging guitar cuts in. They save the power and the darkness for right at the end, yet there’s real melody in there too – you can hum the riff that shreiks across over the Ketametallica noise – and they also manage to cut back and forth between that intensity and the slower sections (augmented by violin lines of great beauty). Something that’s all rage one moment is a thing of beauty the next, it’s the whole album in miniature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JN2w82fmmXc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an important album to me. It was one I would I put on if I were upset, but nowadays I see so much beauty under the noise I wonder whether it was much more of a comfort than I realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chemikal.co.uk/news/come-on-die-young-reissue-june-16th/&quot;&gt;“Come On Die Young” was reissued as a deluxe vinyl box set earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. I bought a copy (despite being skint) but shipping was delayed because of a fault with the pressing. However I’m hoping that it will arrive this week. There’s a stack of additional material attached to the re-release and once I have ploughed through that, I will write up an addendum to this post with more info on those tracks (and whether the remaster affects the original album in any way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Amy Dupcak for having &lt;a href=&quot;http://no-alternative-daily.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/ill-tell-you-about-punk-rock.html&quot;&gt;the text of the Iggy Pop quote on her blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Whatever Happened To That Hat?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/whatever-happened-to-that-hat"/>
   <updated>2014-07-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/whatever-happened-to-that-hat</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The hat in question is a Wilco baseball cap that I bought at a gig of theirs in 2004, the night that Germany got eliminated from Euro 2004. I’d love to show you a picture of it but I can’t, there isn’t even a picture of it from a Wilco merch site: at least not one that Google or Bing images can see anyway. I did manage to find a side-on picture of it in my bedroom in 2005 and zoom right in on it like they do in CSI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/That-Hat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to start we have to go back a bit further to Easter in 2004, with everyone away from the flat where I lived. I must have been up at 5 AM to listen to a copy of Wilco’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Ghost_Is_Born&quot;&gt;“A Ghost is Born”&lt;/a&gt; that I’d downloaded off the net - damn I can’t even remember the name of the software but this one guy had so many cool albums - and AGIB just blew me away. A heady mix of great music and sleep deprivation no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few months and I’m &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wedgewood-rooms.co.uk&quot;&gt;back in my home town&lt;/a&gt; enthusing to two guys from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.choosechicago.com&quot;&gt;Wilco’s hometown&lt;/a&gt; in the street outside of a kebab shop after the gig. I’m eating kebab shop chips and am filled with the zeal of someone who’s had their artistic nipple tweaked and is talking to strangers and is wearing this totally sweet hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That hat, or rather the gig where I got it from, is where mattischrome was born — the new name of my alter ego — the name of my entire online identity (including this blog thanks to the nation of Montenegro) stems from the username I invented for &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.viachicago.org&quot;&gt;a Wilco message board&lt;/a&gt;: one that I joined so that I could download pictures of that gig (and most importantly the set list). “Hell is Chrome” is the second track on “A Ghost is Born” and it’s ace. “Matt is Chrome”, given my early greying hair, seemed like a witty and sensible appropriation. Of course, it now makes everyone think that I am a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Matti&quot;&gt;Swedish guy named Mattis&lt;/a&gt; who really likes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/&quot;&gt;Google’s browser&lt;/a&gt; (which did not exist at this time, nor did Gmail strangely enough which is why the first mattischrome account is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/category/hotmail/&quot;&gt;Hotmail&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/3830451.stm&quot;&gt;England lost to Portugal on penalties&lt;/a&gt; in Lisbon. Within a year (three months come to think of it) I’d be in love with a Portuguese woman and in love with her culture and nation too. It feels like the majority of my life has been lived since then. Back then I couldn’t speak Portuguese which just feels weird somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whatever happened to that hat? Well it was always around, usually hanging from a tall lamp in the corner of my bedroom until the day I moved away from St Albans. That day my friend Albert helped me move out. He swiped the hat and looked better wearing it than I ever did, so I let him keep it. Perhaps he still has it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, June 2014</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-june-2014"/>
   <updated>2014-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-june-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://temporaryresidence.com/artists/watter&quot;&gt;Watter&lt;/a&gt; are a “supergroup” composed from various members of Grails, &lt;a href=&quot;http://touchandgorecords.com/bands/band.php?id=70&quot;&gt;Slint&lt;/a&gt;, and other bands. I did not know anything about Hundred Waters before this month: “The Moon Rang Like A Bell” is their second album. In fact second albums by bands I know nothing about are a something of theme because “Sunbathing Animal” is Parquet Courts’ sophomore effort and I don’t know anything about them either. Meanwhile, I’ve meant to write about “The Four Seasons Recomposed” since April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;watter-this-world&quot;&gt;Watter “This World”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fingerprints of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grailsongs.com&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; are all over this album, a collaboration between Zak Riles (of Grails) and a few other musicians I’ve not heard of: &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.louisvillehardcore.com/index.php?title=Strike_City&quot;&gt;Tyler Trotter&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.factmag.com/2014/03/12/murder-ballads-an-interview-with-slint/&quot;&gt;Britt Walford&lt;/a&gt; of Slint; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rachelgrimespiano.com&quot;&gt;Rachel Grimes&lt;/a&gt;. On the opener “Rustic Fog” it’s the slippery slide guitars that give the game away, though the gentle heartbeat and the woozy windswept synths add a level of detail that you wouldn’t find on [Deep Politics](album-digest-march-2012 or &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.temporaryresidence.com/trr187&quot;&gt;The Black Tar Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;. In fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/temporary-residence-ltd-1/watter-rustic-fog&quot;&gt;“Rustic Fog”&lt;/a&gt; most resembles one of the longer tracks from either of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mexicansummer.com/shop/lilacs-champagne/&quot;&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/a&gt; albums (note that Zak isn’t in L&amp;amp;C though); it bubbles rather than boils and the lack of vocal samples gives the music room enough to build and to glower, unlike tracks like “Le Grand” from Grails’ hyperactive hip-hop side project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second track “Lord I Want More” is more folky with finger-picked acoustic guitars and sensitive piano playing replacing the murky synths until about half way through when it melts into a weird starry synth lullaby, collapsing in on itself like a dream does when you wake up. The end of “Lord I Want More” sets up the intro to &amp;lt;”Small Business”, one of two much longer tracks (“Small Business” is 13:32 and “Seawater” is 12:51) that fill out the majority of the run time. “Small Business” begins like a less subtle Grails track, built on strong guitars and strident drums. It’s a bit too mellow for it’s own good but there is plenty of space and structure for the chiming guitars to move around in. It feels like a relief when the fireworks really kick in on the five and a half minute mark and the track really takes off. With just over four minutes left “Small Business” becomes a gentle trancey piece again with a riff that sounds like stones skipping across the water, completely with splashing sounds and some nifty work with the pedals. It’s got a nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://philipglassrework.com&quot;&gt;Philip Glass&lt;/a&gt; feel to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this is a shorter track “Bloody Monday” which includes a vocal sample, more finger picking, and a country violin. It’s a beautiful wordless song that seems to be a million miles from its title. The sound is so clear and crisp, it really feels like a break from the fog that hangs over Grails records: perhaps this is what “Almost Grew My Hair” could have been in a perfect world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other long piece “Seawater” is even better than “Small Business”. The first few minutes build off a nagging riff and droning synth: these are the creepiest moments on the album. Then a strong drumbeat kicks in and finger-picked acoustic guitar builds a riff around that instead, before an electric guitar also takes up the riff. In the background the synths still spiral around producing a sound fog to get lost in. As with “Lord I Want More” and “Bloody Monday”, the riff is folky when it finally emerges and soars above all everything else. The rest of the track is a guitar playing master class and there’s one bit of riffing counterpoint around 8:30 that’s so amazing that I can’t really explain why it excites me so much. It’s noisy and it’s mellow, the aural equivalent of salty and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final track is the title track, a beautiful sound envelope that’s basically virtual reality realised as music. Put “This World” on and imagine the most perfect place you could be, this is music that will transport you there. Expect to hear it soundtracking a quiet moment of transcendent beauty in a movie near you some time soon. More finger picked guitar lines dance over insistent piano motifs gliding forward in time like a figure skater on ice. It’s serenely and divinely beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/this-world/id848494332&quot;&gt;The iTunes version of the album has a bonus track “Digital Camo”&lt;/a&gt; that is also interesting. It doesn’t feel as well rounded as the rest of the material here but it’s very upbeat and is just a few good lyrics short of being a decent rock song. Unlike the rest of the tracks here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/temporary-residence-ltd-1/watter-digital-camo-digital-bonus-track&quot;&gt;you get the feeling that the band peeled this one off very quickly&lt;/a&gt;. Overall “This World” is a fine instrumental album and one that further adds to my belief that Grails are awesome. It’s hard to know whether Watter are a permanent proposition or a one-off project: I guess it all depends on whether Grails are in fact in the process of amicably breaking up. Both Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne and now Watter prove that while we will lose a lot if they are, we will also gain much much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hundred-waters-the-moon-rang-like-a-bell&quot;&gt;Hundred Waters “The Moon Rang Like A Bell”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the best way to get started on writing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hundred-waters.com&quot;&gt;“The Moon Rang Like A Bell”&lt;/a&gt; is to provide a list of albums it reminds me of: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.subpop.com/releases/washed_out/within_and_without&quot;&gt;“Within And Without” by Washed Out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/dec/13/best-albums-2012-grimes-visions&quot;&gt;“Visions” by Grimes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.factmag.com/2012/06/04/laurel-halo-quarantine/&quot;&gt;“Quarantine” by Laurel Halo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-february-2011/&quot;&gt;“James Blake”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-april-2013/&quot;&gt;“Overgrown”&lt;/a&gt; by James Blake, “If You Wait” by London Grammar, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ranker.com/list/best-enya-albums-list/reference?utm_expid=16418821-33.0-sZtzOfTrqQsZax8VZVyw.0&quot;&gt;and one of my mum’s old Enya albums&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not to say that they sound exactly like the exact average of those albums (imagine that?!), it’s just a starting point from which we can begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another starting point might be to relate some things that I have learned about the band. They are a four piece from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visitflorida.com/en-us.html&quot;&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; who have supported Alt+J and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thexx.info&quot;&gt;The xx&lt;/a&gt; in the past. This is their second album and the first to receive major attention. &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/hundredwaters&quot;&gt;They have a nice Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. I also find it interesting that one of the band was a programmer for streaming music service &lt;a href=&quot;http://grooveshark.com&quot;&gt;Grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They follow the xx/Chvrches/London Grammar template of having a breathy female singer (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefourohfive.com/news/article/exposure-nicole-miglis&quot;&gt;Nicole Miglis&lt;/a&gt;) backed up with a few guys (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hearhums.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/trayer-tryon.html&quot;&gt;Trayer Tryon&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Giese, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.grooveshark.com/post/32878521523/an-interview-with-zach-tetreault-of-hundred-waters&quot;&gt;Zach Tetreault&lt;/a&gt;). What makes them different is that they try to square the difference between perky Chvrches and languid London Grammar. There’s lots of quirky production and variation in pace, things that I thought were lacking from London Grammar’s “If You Wait”. So while a lot of the tracks, like “Broken Blue” and “Chambers [Passing Train]”, depend as much on space as sound, there are also songs like the fantastic “Down From The Rafters” that pick up the pace a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting production ideas are what draw the comparison to Grimes and James Blake, while the laid back bits definitely recall Washed Out and The xx. It’s a bit unfocussed in places but that’s not a bad thing, albums like “Quarantine” and “Visions” are great precisely because the roughness around the edges rewards repeat listening. If you’re looking for an album to sunbathe to, try this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parquet-courts-sunbathing-animal&quot;&gt;Parquet Courts “Sunbathing Animal”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d not heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://parquetcourts.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Parquet Courts&lt;/a&gt; at all until a few weeks ago but “Sunbathing Animal” is their second album (&lt;a href=&quot;http://parquetcourts.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/american-specialties/&quot;&gt;or is it?!&lt;/a&gt;). They’re from New York and they live up to the hype and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2013/05/the-50-greatest-new-york-city-rock-bands/&quot;&gt;that heritage&lt;/a&gt;. It is better when bands mature out of the spotlight, it gives them a bit of time to refine their vision and come up with some solid material. That is definitely the case here because “Sunbathing Animal” is a cracking album. My response to it has been similar to &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-april-2013/&quot;&gt;“Change Becomes Us” by Wire last year&lt;/a&gt;: it’s a slow burner overall but there are enough hooks to get you addicted and into loving the whole thing over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by shouting from the rooftops about the hooks. The album begins with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7925-this-is-it-ten-years-of-the-strokes/&quot;&gt;Strokes&lt;/a&gt;-like riff of “Bodies Made Of” and then rushes into the single “Black and White”. Listen close though, it’s not all wiry guitar work and crashing cymbals: there are some pretty cool lyrics there. Later on, there is my favourite song on the album “What Colour Is Blood?” (Still the same that it was, apparently) and the rollicking “Ducking and Dodging”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template for those upbeat tracks is provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.pinterest.com/JuniperRidge/music-nyc-punk-rock-heroes/&quot;&gt;all those New York punk bands you love&lt;/a&gt; (or post-punk in the case of “Vienna II” and the title track). For the more mellow tracks the reference points are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loureed.com/inmemoriam/&quot;&gt;Lou Reed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stereogum.com/1368561/spiritualized-albums-from-worst-to-best/list/&quot;&gt;Spiritualized&lt;/a&gt; (though I guess I should say &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/01/popandrock.suicide&quot;&gt;Suicide&lt;/a&gt; to keep up the NYC connections) - in fact “Always Back In Town” sounds like Jay Spaceman backed by The Strokes. The presence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.banquetrecords.com/RSD14LCDS&quot;&gt;LCD Soundsystem looms over the whole album&lt;/a&gt; too, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is simply too much to write about this album: be it the way that “She’s Rolling” lumbers in and out of view accompanied by the most demented harmonica work I’ve heard this side of &lt;a href=&quot;/understated-classics-13/&quot;&gt;The Orb’s “Towers of Dub”&lt;/a&gt;, or how “Instant Disassembly” seems to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/past/unbound/classrev/lolita.htm&quot;&gt;compress an entire novel’s worth of story into its seven minutes&lt;/a&gt;, or even how the thrash of “Sunbathing Animal” makes nearly four minutes seem like just one. Needless to say that, with all this going on, this album is a thing of unmitigated joy and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;max-richter-the-four-seasons-recomposed&quot;&gt;Max Richter “The Four Seasons Recomposed”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maxrichtermusic.com/en/index.php&quot;&gt;Max Richter&lt;/a&gt;, the question is inevitably: why did he attempt to recompose the Four Seasons? Well mainly it was because he asked to. Deutsche Grammophon has decided to try and be cool (this decision, as is oft the case with humans and record labels, coincides with a base 10 round number anniversary), and commission electronic artistes to “reevaluate” some of their classic classical recordings, sampling them to create new pieces. Previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://matthewherbert.com&quot;&gt;Matthew Herbert&lt;/a&gt;, whose original work I have a profound admiration for, did various apaprently unspeakable things to a recording of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._10_(Mahler&quot;&gt;Mahler’s Unfinished 10th&lt;/a&gt;). Judging by the reviews of the result in that case, see the quite frothy response on amazon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1XNS20K72C17S/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=B003F0NFPO&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1WXJ22ULODT75/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=B003F0NFPO&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, not everyone is ready for music they love to be endowed with additional postmodern flourishes and/or conceptual weight. Traditional listeners of DG records might decide to swap “flourishes” and “weight” for more impolite nouns and I would not hold it against them. However, the modern listener, saturated with “classical” music from day one, may find that the conceptual widgets help to amplify particular signals amid the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the Four Seasons, Richter decided that he couldn’t do enough with the recording he was due to work with and found that the only thing he felt happy to “sample” and rearrange was the original score. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2068037/&quot;&gt;a prolific soundtrack artist&lt;/a&gt;, Richter no doubt felt there were motifs and riffs that he wanted to cast in a new light, and while sampling is an incredible technique in skilled hands, perhaps these were things he could only do at an atomic level. I’m aware of, but have not heard, his “genuine” (as opposed to screen) work but I do know that it is held in high regard. In particular a piece called “Memory House” that has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?ID=15305&quot;&gt;performed by the London Sinfonietta&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.londonsinfonietta.org.uk&quot;&gt;LS themselves&lt;/a&gt; can be relied upon to be “up for” performing screechy modern pieces - not to say that Memory House is one of those. I’m going to find and copy and listen to it when I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to classical music, my tastes are shallow in some ways - I only dip my toes in the more traditional canon once in a while. I think you can be said to be enthusiastic for a piece if you seek out multiple performances of it and I’ve only ever done that with three pieces. One is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_Concerto_(Mendelssohn)&quot;&gt;Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in E-minor&lt;/a&gt; (a dip of the toe into that deeper wider canon) and the other is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Steve-Reich-Different-Trains/2699&quot;&gt;“Different Trains” by Steve Reich&lt;/a&gt; (more akin to the usual bathing place). The third piece (and a second dip of that toe) is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/rodrigo%E2%80%99s-concierto-de-aranjuez-which-recording-is-best&quot;&gt;Rodrigo’s Concierto de Aranjuez&lt;/a&gt; - I have always loved the shimmering mirages of its second movement and have heard quite a few variations, &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304655104579163722788382890&quot;&gt;including one by Miles Davis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to actually review the album in question. I like it. It’s now to fussy to be enjoyed in the way that the original is best enjoyed: with the lead violin role placed squarely &lt;a href=&quot;http://bachtrack.com/review-bbc-prom-34-2013-nigel-kennedy&quot;&gt;in the hands of a bonkers virtuoso like Nigel Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless many of the original’s charms are intact (that wonderful brooding and shimmering movement in Summer for example) and other facets of the piece are enhanced in Richter’s new arrangement: it’s much more emotional and lyrical than I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CD version also contains five electronic pieces by Richter (“Shadows”) that are fairly inessential and four remixes of a movement from each of the seasons. The first, “Spring 1”, by Richter himself is probably the best, applying all the electronics and bird song samples that he presumably couldn’t bring himself to adorn an original DG recording with. The remix of “Autumn 3” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/fearoftigers&quot;&gt;Fear of Tigers&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic but presented in a truncated version: the twelve inch version available on SoundCloud and Spotify is far better. The other two mixes are fairly servicable too, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robotsdontsleep.com&quot;&gt;Robot Koch&lt;/a&gt; even decides to turn “Summer 3” into hip-hop with results that are not too cringeworthy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it’s a respectful undertaking that is a qualified success. As with all remakes and reboots and such like, it’s always best to retain a connection to the original - just as well there’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://vivaldisfourseasons.com&quot;&gt;a companion app&lt;/a&gt; to help you explore both works if you like that kind of thing. Beyond that, I will certainly be investigating more of Richter’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, May 2014</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-may-2014"/>
   <updated>2014-05-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-may-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month was strange. I didn’t listen to much new music and after &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-april-2014/&quot;&gt;last month’s bumper digest&lt;/a&gt; there’s probably a reason for that. Not to mention that Spotify gives you more reasons to look backwards than forwards. Nevertheless, this brief post features new albums by Little Dragon and Coldplay, along with the mini-album collaboration between Röyskopp and Robyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;little-dragon-nabuma-rubberband&quot;&gt;Little Dragon “Nabuma Rubberband”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered Little Dragon, like most people, I imagine, via Gorillaz’ “Plastic Beach” album. When I investigated their “Machine Dreams” album I was surprised that their sound had transplanted to “Plastic Beach” intact. Sometimes you discover a band through a collaboration and their own work turns out to be disappointing, somehow diminished by the other artist(s) no longer being present. “Machine Dreams” is a fine album that breezes by, much like “Empire Ants” and “To Binge” do on “Plastic Beach”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I completely missed their last album “Ritual Union” album from 2011 (I haven’t heard it at all) and now “Nabuma Rubberband” arrives with a bit of hype and a sprightly new art direction (not to mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.7digital.com/artist/little-dragon/release/best-of&quot;&gt;a rush job “Best of” comp&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year). The lead off singles “Paris” and “Let Go” showed quite a lot of promise too. At first “Nabuma Rubberband” (excellent title by the way) sounds oddly mired in collaboration mode, with the band seemingly collaborating with other people’s expectations for them. For example opener “Mirror” sounds like Massive Attack picking up from where “Mezzanine” left off. This is, of course, a very good thing because who among us does not pretend on a daily basis that “100th Window” never happened? It’s a pretty song but it seems focus grouped some how, the right pressure points applied and the right references given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all said, “Nabuma Rubberband” does seem to grow in confidence as it progresses. As I’ve said, the singles are great and “Klipp Klapp” is a decent little runaround too. There is a very weird and very brief interlude that makes you think they’re about to go dub step or something similarly banal/atrocious but it all blows over, a witty musical red herring. Overall the album is a nice mellow affair and worth at least a background listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coldplay-ghost-stories&quot;&gt;Coldplay “Ghost Stories”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was travelling around South America I listened a lot to both “A Rush Of Blood To The Head” and “X &amp;amp; Y”. If I’m honest it’s because they fit well to both the business of staring out of the window at wonderful landscapes and that of taking a crafty nap while no one’s looking. To my mind they’re both good albums. I tried “Viva La Vida” again too and I like it more than I used to. Apparently I quite liked “Mylo Xyloto”, when &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-october-2011/&quot;&gt;I reviewed it on these pages in October 2011&lt;/a&gt;, but to be honest I lost interest in it (beyond the singles) after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I need to go back to “Mylo Xyloto” though because the new album “Ghost Stories” isn’t that great. This is a shame because I wanted to like it and I like a lot of the collaborators involved (including shiny disco twat-pleaser Avicii). Nevertheless it’s let down by its dreariness and lack of dynamism. You can’t even argue that they’re experimenting: they’ve either arranged songs like this before or other bands have produced similar songs that are better. There’s only two songs that aren’t let down by dreadful weepy maudlin lyrics and that’s not a great return. A third decent song is “Midnight” which is basically the sound of the rest of the band trying their hardest to pretend that Chris Martin isn’t there, an approach that probably should have been adopted on the rest of the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;röyksopp--robyn-do-it-again&quot;&gt;Röyksopp &amp;amp; Robyn “Do It Again”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-september-2010/&quot;&gt;The first time I ever wrote an album digest on this blog&lt;/a&gt; I included a Robyn EP and Röyksopp’s slightly underwhelming album “Senior”. This EP, just 5 tracks and 35 minutes of it, represents a collaboration between two of my favourite artists. Robyn’s last album “Body Talk” was my favourite album of 2010 and Röyksopp’s “Junior” (2009) is on my list of upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;/tags#understated-classics/&quot;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; posts. They have each featured in collaborations on both of those albums: “Body Talk” features the low-key trance skulk of “None Of Dem” and “Junior” has the excellent single “The Girl and The Robot”. I guess that’s another reason for calling it “Do It Again”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first 5 tracks and just 35 minutes seems disappointing but it’s longer than at least two of the albums from last month’s album digest and in this case it’s all killer and no filler. It even manages to sound like a full length album by virtue of being varied and variegated throughout. First track “Monument” is long and lazy, it seems to be about the singularity or some such. It starts with pulses and beats, then a digitized saxophone appears (definitely the best sax on a record since Röyksopp’s own “She’s So” back on “Melody AM”) that becomes more and more “real” (as in acoustic-sounding) as the track progresses. Coupled to Robyn’s elegiac and moody vocal it’s a very stately opener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is “Sayit”, in which a speak and spell is instructed on how to get its freak on by Robyn. It’s a wonderful tune that makes a huge racket and shows exactly how a Kraftwerk record would (or maybe just should) sound now - that is if they’d continued along the lines of “Electric Café/Techno Pop” route - the fussy narrator of “The House Phone” short circuited into a “fuck mechanic” and a growling techno monster. This is jolting visceral stuff and you can hear why an EP is ideal, the short run time allows for this one great peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title track is the most Robyn-dominated song here and very much like songs from “Body Talk”. It has a clever lyric that’s conflicted, either the two lovers in the song should not get back together because they’ll only “do it again” or they should get back together so that they can indeed “do it again”. Deliciously the song never comes down on a decision either way. The next song “Every Little Thing” is probably the weakest thing here, the backing sounds recycled from Röyksopp’s “What Else Is There?” of “The Understanding” (the track that did more than any other to convince me that The Knife’s Karin Dreijer Andersson has a fantastic voice) and the lyric and song are not quite up to Robyn’s super high stands. The lovely cooing chorus is what saves it though, what it lacks in bells and whistles it makes up a little in heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally there’s the amazing “Inside The Idle Hour Club” - the best single track that I’ve heard so far this year. A sprawling 10 minute ambient instrumental, it manages to achieve everything Röyksopp tried and failed to do on “Senior”. It’s utterly mellow and absorbing, and ends in angelic choirs. It’s the only track that I am going to embed from this month. Overall “Do It Again” is a compelling mini-album that doesn’t over stay its welcome and manages to bear repeat listens, highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2014-05-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-9</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a tour full of highlights, Christmas week of 2013 was nonetheless one of the greatest weeks of my life. I may have moaned, groaned, and got completely soaked, but it was worth it to see Machu Picchu in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-story-so-far&quot;&gt;“The Story So Far”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-1&quot;&gt;Arriving in Quito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-2&quot;&gt;Otovalo and Misahualli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-3&quot;&gt;Banos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-4&quot;&gt;Ingapirca and Cuenca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-5&quot;&gt;Into Peru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-8&quot;&gt;Arequipa and Cusco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sacred-valley&quot;&gt;The Sacred Valley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 22nd December, we set off from the hotel in Cusco for a trip along the Sacred Valley that lines the Urubamba river. This valley includes a great number of Inca sites of archeological interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started out at another of the rescue centres that provide visitors to South America with their best glimpses of the continent’s beautiful yet sadly vanishing wildlife. As before, my emotions were conflicted: on one hand I saw beautiful animals and birds, but on the other they were in cages and victims of man’s horrible treatment of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;písac&quot;&gt;Písac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first main stop was Písac (after a brief stop at a viewpoint where the main image for this post was taken) and we were taken around this breathtaking site that features many of the classic Incan agricultural terraces that enabled them to overproduce food and sustain their empire across many square miles and many different altitudes and terrains. Apparently they also experimented with different strains of their crops. The views were amazing and you couldn’t help but pose in front of them. I think I took more photos with other people’s cameras than with my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ollantaytambo&quot;&gt;Ollantaytambo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a rather lacklustre all-you-can-eat lunch (unfortunately all-you-can-eat is a somewhat diminished experience when you are on antibiotics that prevent you from eating dairy and other delicious foodstuffs), we went on to Ollantaytambo a village of shops selling tourist tat that crowds below a magnificent Inca fort. Rising out on steep steps and completely dominating the hillside, I did wonder how on earth Machu Picchu could possibly compare. Apparently it took the Incas a fierce battle to quell a local tribe known as the Tambo, so they subsequently built this enormous fortification to protect their gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views from the top are amazing, you can see right across the valley. An alternative to the Inca Trail (known as the Lares Trek) takes in much of the surrounding area and I think it either departs from or arrives in Ollantaytambo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed overnight in home stays at Ollantaytambo. As ever, I found the ceilings to be way too small. I bought some crap acrylic gloves and overpriced cereal bars for the journey ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-inca-trail-day-1&quot;&gt;The Inca Trail, day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we took a cramped smelly bus from Ollantaytambo to rejoin the Urubamba river at the start of the “classic” Inca Trail. We got stamped through passport control, though we had to wait while another porter was found because some of our number had packed a little too much to take along. We played charades across the river (with both cheating and suggestion of answers prevented by the raging water) before the guides who were already on the trail side of the bridge got bored (or decided we were disturbing the wildlife or whatever) and led our friends, and only source of amusement for the time being, away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the matter of porters, the management of the Inca Trail, and the way that tours are run by different companies, that is a complex discussion that could easily fill up a whole extra post. Or three. I didn’t see it myself (or even hear about it until later) but the porters were treated pretty badly throughout the three days, there were reports that they had to sleep in the toilets at one camp site. Given that those toilets were among the worst I’d ever encountered (I say this with foreknowledge of the Bolivian toilets, which were worse) I’m pretty horrified and from what other members of the tour have told me I feel naive for not having spotted it myself. Nevertheless being a porter definitely carries a cachet and is well paying compared to other jobs in the area. I thought they were amazing, tackling the terrain with 25kg on their backs in terrible shoes and with no poles or other aids. Seeing them jolt past you certainly keeps you motivated to keep going!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we gained an additional porter, were allowed through, and caught up with the rest of the group. We saw the biggest blackest spider ever after one of the Japanese guys started chasing it around to take pictures of it. Given the responses to my tarantula pictures, I have censored the snaps of it from this post. At lunch, we had our first taste of the food that would be our fare for the next few days. The best bit was the soup. The rest was a blur of uninspired meat and veg that I would often feel too tired to eat. Did I really expect gourmet food on the Inca trail?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we walked some more and encountered the Inca ruins of Patallacta. Again the site was really impressive but we couldn’t explore because we were so far above it. Perhaps we would have done had we not been delayed at passport control. I did quite well on that first day buoyed by feeling better and the fact that the going was easier than I had expected but I was so exhausted by the time we got back to the campsite. That night I took some diamox (in case the fatigue was altitude related) and was haunted by it, I’ve never had to go to the pee so many times in my life. I barely slept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-inca-trail-day-2&quot;&gt;The Inca Trail, day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I was delighted that I had barely slept a wink, given that the second day of the Inca Trail is the hardest, home as it is to the infamous Dead Woman’s Pass. To cross it, you effectively climb the height of Snowden in four hours from a starting point that is three times as high as Snowden in the first place. A lot of the time it was raining but this was a pretty good thing as it drove us on. The climb is steep and it took loads out of me, when I reached the top I was quite overcome and let out a massive roar. A bit weird perhaps, but entirely the right thing to do at the time. When I think about how I felt, all I can think of is that roar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Dead Woman’s Pass, it was pretty much all down hill. I took this very slowly as I don’t like going down slippery rocks. I was lucky that Angela continued to keep me company even though she could have shot on ahead. In the end she left behind to continue at her own pace while I had a nice chat with one of the porters instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to the camp site I don’t think I’ve ever been as tired. I somehow struggled in for late lunch and drank chamomile tea. I don’t even remember heading back to the tent, just that I collapsed later and woke up for dinner later on with the rain pounding down again. After dinner we listened to Christmas songs, so tired that it was almost as though we were drunk (no alcohol on the trail, unless you’re our tour leader) as we sang along to the twelve days of Christmas as it emanated from my smartphone amplified by a tin cup. Later on I would sleep from 9pm till 6am without so much as turning over, even though I’d slept for four hours earlier on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-inca-trail-day-3&quot;&gt;The Inca Trail, day 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d got it into my head that the rest of the trail would be a breeze after day two. It is easier but instead of one humungous pass to climb up and over, on day three you go up and down three different times. You also get to see more tambos and towns though, not to mention tropical vegetation. The weather in the morning was lovely but it turned rainy after lunch and we all got pretty wet. Even so, it was a beautiful walk - especially the Inca tunnel. At one point I tried to phone home (it was Christmas Day after all) but the phone failed in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-inca-trail-day-4-arrival-at-machu-picchu&quot;&gt;The Inca Trail, day 4: Arrival at Machu Picchu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the final day and the short walk to Machu Picchu, we had to be up at 3am in order to give the porters plenty of time to reach the train from Aguas Calientes with our gear. We had breakfast (pancakes? or did I dream them?) and noted that the rain had stopped. Meanwhile the gates to the last section of the Inca trail open at 5am, just after sunrise. It was freezing waiting but our group was the first in line, which was great. Running back for a last minute poo was the most tactically successful poo of my life though it did also mean that I’ve seen how big a pile of bog roll is used to wipe up after two hundred people’s poos. All I could think was “don’t fall over, don’t fall over”, which isn’t easy when you’re squatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section is easy. Like skipping easy. I don’t know whether it was excitement or a genuine liberation through tiredness but I bounced my way through that last bit. I had a little difficulty with the nearly vertical steps just before the Sun Gate (as in I was panting after) but everything else was just fine. It was a mood that permeated through our group: it was sunny, no more tents until Salta, and finally we’d see Machu Picchu!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the sun gate it was still pretty gloomy but the view was spectacular. I knew that I had to calm down and try to look at it all intently, take it all in, as though I had a duty to remember that moment. In reality I just beamed at it and it, the landscape, in turn just seared itself in to me. The beauty of it, the impossibility of it, the shadows of the clouds, it’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet, the sun came out as we made our way down the path to Machu Picchu itself. From there everything’s a blur, a wonderful blur. It finally felt like I was away from everything and yet at the same time I was with new friends and we’d conquered this trail together, now wandering through this amazing wonder of the world. The tiredness rushed in and all the while I smelled like the test subject of a deodorant factory but that didn’t matter, I felt unreservedly content and happy for the first time in the longest time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_9/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ps&quot;&gt;PS:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked up Machu Picchu in the dictionary of my Mac so that I would spell it consistently and correctly. I  liked the following addition to the description: “It is famous for its dramatic position, perched high on a steep-sided ridge.” That it is. I will never forget it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Should I Drop Dropbox?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/should-i-drop-dropbox"/>
   <updated>2014-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/should-i-drop-dropbox</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about whether I want to use Dropbox to sync my files anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I love Dropbox. It came along in beta in just 2008 just as I needed it to manage my PhD thesis. In fact I often jokingly claim to having invented it by asking on the MacRumors forums whether a program like it existed  - just a few weeks before its beta rode in to my life like a knight in shining armour. I recognised the need for a service that would synchronise a single directory and its contents between multiple computers using The Power Of The Internet™. I was used to using commands like scp to maintain my static blog on the university’s servers and the multiple computers that I authored it from, though in 2008 when I moved back to my parents’ house to write up my PhD I was frustrated that I couldn’t work out how to do the same things when the target was a PC running Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Dropbox. It filled the role beautifully, no matter whether I used my parent’s PC with the printer attached or my own mac when sequestered away in my room, I was always updating the right version. This is crucial when writing a thesis! As a beta tester I started with a decent amount of space and this expanded over the years, I even completed one of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dropbox.com/2012/05/dropquest-ii-the-future-is-now/&quot;&gt;“dropquests”&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years various iterations of models I worked on got synced all over the place with Dropbox, though in retrospect perhaps I should have used a transfer method that allowed me to step away from things more decisively from time to time. Last week I finally purged those models from my Dropbox folder and it felt really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious use for Dropbox these days is to back up and store my photos. (I also use synced storage to access my technical PDFs while on the go.) I recently upgraded my phone and while it is magical how easy it is to move photos from one phone to the next, it would be more difficult if I was moving away from Apple to Android or Windows Phone because I use the easy to use Photo Stream. Dropbox offers a platform neutral solution to the problem of photo backup and up until recently I’d thought that I’d buy space from them so that I could store all my photos with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However two things made me think again. The first is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dropbox.com/2014/04/growing-our-leadership-team/&quot;&gt;appointment of Iraq War architect Condoleezza Rice to the board of Dropbox ahead of its IPO&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drop-dropbox.com&quot;&gt;this well-argued website points out&lt;/a&gt;, it sends out a poor message to users of service that relies on privacy to appoint someone who authorised unwarranted wiretaps while in power. With Dr. Rice on the board, it is possible to perceive Dropbox as the kind of company that would spy on you without you knowing it. It’s all very well (crucial in fact) to submit to law enforcement clutching warrants but to those without warrants simply wrapped up in the flag? No thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dropbox.com/2014/04/our-commitment-to-your-rights-and-privacy/&quot;&gt;Dropbox pleads its innocence&lt;/a&gt; but then it pretty much has to. They have always had a playful sense of fun and their trademark hand drawn cartoons promote a gentle ideology of making things easy for their users. Perhaps Dr. Rice would not be allowed to alter the ethos of the company and Dropbox would not change. Unfortunately I think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2014/04/3-ingenious-design-details-in-carousel-dropboxs-new-photo-app/&quot;&gt;Carousel&lt;/a&gt;, a new mobile app which looks after the photos in your Dropbox folder, shows that the company are in fact becoming control freaks. It’s the little things and I am not sure I trust them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed Carousel on my phone only to find that it would not work unless I allowed the app to upload all the photos on my phone to Dropbox. I know that I had considered putting all my photos on Dropbox but there is a difference between wanting to and &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to! I had photos in my Dropbox folder already so I didn’t need to upload any to see how the app worked. I have a huge problem with auto-upload services that you have to opt out of rather than opt in to. Apple does it too, but when you turn off Photo Stream it doesn’t cripple the entire photo viewing experience on your device. If you let Dropbox upload all your photos and then delete them, can you really trust them to actually delete them given how much they wanted them there in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what next? Well, it might make you laugh but I am slowly moving toward Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/&quot;&gt;OneDrive&lt;/a&gt; service. I have more space there (28 Gb vs 10.8 Gb) and while Microsoft have hardly been the epitome of great software in the past, the OneDrive service is multi-platform and works as well as Dropbox. Some might argue that this is simply transferring my head from the jaws of a lion to those of a wolf. Nevertheless I’m going to tinker with OneDrive over the next few weeks and make up my mind. (Other services are also available, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://spideroak.com&quot;&gt;SpiderOak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copy.com/home/&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/a&gt;, but I don’t really have time to evaluate them again. I found SpiderOak to be overpriced and slow when I tried it before. Copy is generous with space but after installation I had no use for another dropbox at the time - perhaps Copy is a good bet.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, March 2014</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-march-2014"/>
   <updated>2014-03-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-march-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m back in the UK so it’s back to posts about albums each month. This one is a bit different because I didn’t listen to very much new stuff while I was away so not all of the albums are up to date. I had to write about the new album by Liars though because it’s awesome and I couldn’t wait to discuss it! Here’s the list of albums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tegan and Sarah &lt;em&gt;Heartthrob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Let’s Go Extinct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;Mess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London Grammar &lt;em&gt;If You Wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tegan-and-sarah-heartthrob&quot;&gt;Tegan and Sarah &lt;em&gt;Heartthrob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue, as I have throughout my sequence of &lt;a href=&quot;/tags#understated-classics/&quot;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; posts, that a great album is one that changes you as a person. Sometimes an album changes your mood consistently, sometimes an album makes you think about the experiences in your life differently, and sometimes an album is just so great and comes along at just the right time to knock you for six. I’d say that in 2014 Tegan and Sara’s “Heartthrob” has been that album for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only previous experience of Tegan and Sara was their vocal contribution to the Tiesto track “Feel It In My Bones”. I liked that song a lot, I even went so far as to put it on one of my playlists. Meanwhile when “Heartthrob” was originally released back in January 2013, I took advantage of the iTunes single of the week promotion to download the lead single “Closer” for free. But I never listened to it. Ever. Not until I populated my iPod Nano with a smart playlist containing every thing in my library dated 2012 and 2013 for my trip to South America. One day  on shuffle “Closer” came on (I think it must have been after we left Santiago) and I found myself thinking “What the heck is this? It’s brilliant!”. And so I became addicted to “Closer” playing it pretty much twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to Bariloche in Argentina and a decent wi-fi connection, I bought “Heartthrob” on my phone and kept it charged almost solely for playing that album. “Closer” happens to be a perfect three and a half-minute pop song and with the album I got exactly what I wanted: more. It’s an album of exquisitely produced pop music that barely falters at all in its thirty-six minute run time. Highlights include the swooning “I was a fool”, the identity affirming “I’m Not Your Hero”, and the simply wonderful “Love They Say”. Throughout it’s raunchy, e.g. a sample lyric on “Closer” is “All I think of lately is getting you underneath me” and on “You Drove Me Wild” we have “When I think of you I think of your skin”, but it’s also attuned to the dramas of “proper relationships”™ especially in later tracks like “How Come You Don’t Want Me?” and “Shock To Your System”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I would not want to over analyse a gem of a pop album. It’s short, it’s clever, and it always makes me happy to listen to it. I think that’s enough for me. I don’t give scores when I write these pieces but if I did “Heartthrob” would get ten out of ten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fanfarlo-lets-go-extinct&quot;&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Let’s Go Extinct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Fanfarlo. They have an understated classic of their own and “Let’s Go Extinct”, their third album, is pretty close to being one too. It’s a concept album about life and is executed with aplomb. Each song expands the scale and scope under consideration, seamlessly zooming out the lens like those videos that take you from the surface of the earth to the edge of the known universe and back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with their second album “Rooms Filled With Light”, I was underwhelmed at first. Not so much with the first two songs “Life In The Sky” (about the theory of life on Earth being the result of a comet) and “Cell Song” (with its beautiful lyrics about DNA spirals and the whole business of cell division being a pyramid scheme), but rather that the whole thing is rather ponderous on the first few lessons. Of course those first two tracks are among the best Fanfarlo have committed to whatever it is that MP3s are made of. From trying to sing “Cell Song” in the shower I know that it’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; to sing along to, at least correctly, and musically it reveals a lot of interesting detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that as the scale increases to humans and colonies of those humans, things get rather bleak. As early as “Myth of Myself”, which ruminates on how individual thoughts become what we know to be our own personalities, you begin to wonder whether the happiest solution to the problem of “I work around the clock and I’m always tired” is the one that will be considered. I guess it depends on how you read the final line: a fraught scream of “it’s coming down!”. Fortunately the next song is the upbeat celebration of the wilderness “A Distance” though it too seems to be underpinned by a mistrust of communication. It’s one of two belters on the album. The second “Landlocked” is even more upbeat and shiny but even after listening to it thirty I’m not that sure what it’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have guess from the album’s title, Fanfarlo don’t seem to believe our collective story is going to end well. Perhaps they’ve just read Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road” a little too often and extrapolated from there. Mind you, who could blame them, it’s a fantastic book. It doesn’t have to be that way, after all Foals managed to produce a concept album (well part of one in “Total Life Forever”) about the idea of us all heading toward the singularity. Mind you, at least it makes for some achingly beautiful songs. There are three here about the fall of the world: “Painting With Life” (Simon hangs out in an abandoned theme park on his own and self-harms); “The Grey And The Gold” (sample lyrics: “but if nothing dies / how can we learn to live with it?”, music by way of early-90s R.E.M. with extra trumpet); and the amazing “The Beginning And The End” (makes me think of the aliens uncovering the ash-covered Earth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully Fanfarlo won’t go extinct (hey, I’m still buying your records guys!) because I look forward to what they will do next. If there is one thing missing from “Let’s Go Extinct” it’s songs that put the skill of the entire band front and centre. The main difference between “Reservoir” and “Let’s Go Extinct” is that there are fewer moments on the newer album where the music is given enough room to explore the emotions alongside the vocals. The tracks that do are among the more successful and it is telling that the B-side of “Cell Song” is an instrumental version of “Painting With Life” in which the musical beauty of that song is unmasked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a potentially majestic album undermined slightly by its downbeat worldview and inability to cut loose with its musical arrangements. If a slough of despond is okay with you (it is with me), you will find much to enjoy here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;liars-mess&quot;&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;Mess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each new Liars album takes a new tack from the previous one. This makes the announcement of any new Liars album something of an event for me because it sends me scurrying off to listen to the previous N-1 albums to try to work out where they are headed next. It is usually impossible to work out what is going to happen next in the Liars discography though once you listen to the new album it’s possible with hindsight to work out what previous tracks would have signposted the new direction. In this case “Brats” on WIXIW was probably the biggest clue and last year’s excellent double A-side single “Perfume Tear” b/w “I saw you from the lifeboat” given away to e-mail list members was something of a red herring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”Mess” takes “WIXIW”’s delicate electronic plotting (“Brats” aside) and sweeps it away, scooping out the romantic reticence and replacing the skittering beats with a more malevolent industrial sound. It is the leap from the self-titled album to “Sisterworld” conducted in reverse. Here a concept album has given way to a brash reinvention and it is really quite exciting. It is also incredibly fun at the outset with “Mask Maker”’s incongruous calls to “eat my socks” and “eat my face” continuing Liars’ great tradition of fantastic opening tracks. In fact lining up the opening tracks from Liars’ seven albums in one playlist is quite a fun game to play on a rainy day. The song titles alone make it worthwhile. In fact if you have 28 minutes spare, you can listen to them now, all thanks to the magic of Spotify. I for one had forgotten the sheer exuberance of the last minute of “Plaster Casts of Everything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”Mess” itself can be split in to roughly three parts, though this division blurs in some places. At the beginning you have bangers like “Mask Maker” and “Vocal Tuned D.E.D.”, all strident industrial strength dance tracks with detached vocals. Toward the middle the songs are more mellow with more pronounced vocal lines, these are perhaps the most Liars-like songs here with the lyrics of “Pro Anti Anti” a case in point: “Crashed like a car into a tree / I’ll die before the fire’s out” could feature anywhere on Liars’ seven albums even if the electronic arrangements might be a little more out-of-place. Of course, we also have to accept that the adjective “Liars-like” is an oxymoron. My favourite is the title track “Mess on a mission” for both its iconoclastic refrain of “Facts are facts and fiction’s fiction” and the loping blip rhythm that underpins it. The refrain amuses me because (for me) all Liars’ songs are about blurring fact and fiction: “Facts are facts and fiction’s fiction” could almost be the opposite of their artistic manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”Mess” slides into more abstract tracks as it progresses leaving about a third of the songs as an ambient sludge that is compelling to listen to in its own right but also in its callbacks to earlier Liars material. I could try that same playlist trick with closing tracks of their albums though I’m not sure many people would appreciate having to listen to the thirty minute locked groove of “They threw us in a trench and stuck a monument on top”’s closer “The Dust That Makes Mud” more than once. While not quite that locked groove, the sixteen minutes of “Perpetual Village” and “Left Speaker Blown” combined do represent a similar desire to allow the album to drift to a close. These two tracks are more like connective tissue that attach this new direction to Liars’ past material (just as “Brats” on WIXIW looked forward) because you can sense the presence of both the minimalism of “Drums Not Dead” and the clattering chaotic clamour of “They Were Wrong So We Drowned”. Given that these two albums are probably Liars’ career highlights, it’s a high note to end on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tempting question to ask is what Liars might do next. One might argue that with “Mess” perhaps entropy has caught up with them once and for all, but things have looked that way from the beginning. Side note: anyone who thinks “…Monument on top” is a &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; focussed record than “…Drowned” needs their ears checked. The best bet is to go along with the ride, Liars are consistently inconsistent and keep adding great albums to their output as a result. Now take all their albums and shuffle that playlist, that’s a real mess and a complete delight to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;london-grammar-if-you-wait&quot;&gt;London Grammar &lt;em&gt;If You Wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I acquired London Grammar’s “Shyer” in the same fashion as Tegan and Sara’s “Closer”. “Shyer” also happens to be a great song, a beautiful vocal strewn over a pretty yet minimal hook. It promised great things of their album “If You Wait”, which I missed last year but resurfaced this month in special edition form. Unfortunately I didn’t enjoy “If You Wait” as much as “Heartthrob”. In fact I think listening to “If You Wait” in its entirety is rather boring and unpleasant, which is a shame because they are clearly talented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like “Heartthrob”, “If You Wait” is pretty homogeneous. Unfortunately, sometimes homogeneity is a bit boring and this is the case here. Like The XX, London Grammar are a fantastic vocalist backed by two anonymous instrumentalist types. You can play a sort of Top Trumps for bands and play the strengths off against one another. London Grammar are blessed with a better vocalist but poorer songwriters. The “annoying homogeneity” score of both bands would be identical but at least The XX make up for it with tunes. In fact The XX shine in remixed form and this might be the case for London Grammar too as I’m yet to hear any remixes of their songs. The fact that the best thing on the special edition apart from “Shyer” is their collaboration with Disclosure suggests that a) they should mix it up a bit more on their own records and b) the remixes will probably sound pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not all a wash out though. The lead singer does have a magnificent voice, she just needs to sing songs that don’t rhyme lightning with frightening. Having a début album sell enough to merit a special edition at least means that they will be given the chance to improve and I think that they will be worth listening out for if they do.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>South America, Part 8</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-8"/>
   <updated>2014-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-8</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arequipa and Cusco – the two cities that are the subject of this post – are probably the two cities in Peru that are most amenable to travellers (though Lima certainly has a lot to offer too). For me they should have been punctuated with a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colca_Canyon&quot;&gt;Colca canyon&lt;/a&gt;, one of the deepest canyons in the world and twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Unfortunately, I got really sick on the second day in Arequipa as my attempts at keeping my tummy bug at bay finally failed. (Even so, I didn’t actually seek any proper medical help till the second day in Cusco, I was pretty boneheaded about it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive from &lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-7&quot;&gt;Puerto Inca&lt;/a&gt; to Arequipa was long and involved — those Andes aren’t going away any time soon and despite some pretty good roads, it takes a long time to get up, through, and down again. Fortunately once you’ve gone up, Arequipa isn’t all the way down again. The views from the truck’s cab were stunning. By 11am we’d said goodbye to the Pacific ocean — the last time we would see it until February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Arequipa emerged from out of the horizon. Before this trip I tended to think of mountains as rather up and down affairs but the Andes is a range and so you have plateaus to cross as well. These are often barren featureless places populated only by scrub plants, the odd llama, and a couple of lonely stray dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our campsite was in the grounds of a hostel (upgrades to rooms were available) and we pitched our tent under a motorway overpass and next to a stream. This didn’t actually matter (see end notes) when it actually came to sleeping though: earplugs cover a multitude of sins and tiredness does the rest. The walk in to town made me feel a bit woozy though - after all that time at sea level (see part &lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-5&quot;&gt;five&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-6&quot;&gt;six&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;south-america-trip-part-7&quot;&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt;!) my adaptation to altitude had worn off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full day that we had in Arequipa I spent mostly on a city tour. This was worth it because — like Cuenca — Arequipa is a city that has a lot of beautiful surrounding hills and mountains (plus no less than three active volcanoes) to frame it. The tour took us up to three or four viewpoints as well as to a shop that sold products made from alpaca and vicuña wool - the highlight of which&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was the chance to see some alpacas and vicuñas in a little zoo at the back. The vicuña cages have a spit zone around them as they aren’t domesticated creatures and really don’t like people that much! They can spit up to three metres! However vicuña wool is much prized and something as simple as a shawl made from vicuña wool can sell for as much as a thousand dollars&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the city tour we went to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy_Juanita&quot;&gt;Juanita&lt;/a&gt;, the undisputed star of Arequipa (at least for now&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Juanita is the mummy of a young girl discovered in the Andes high above Arequipa by German hikers in 1995. She was found only once a glacier had melted (which is why the hikers were the first to climb up there). Her body had actually rolled down the mountainside from where she was interred and luckily the mountaineers discovered her before too much damage was done. Now she sits in a museum in Arequipa, preserved in ice pretty much in the condition  in which she was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re made to watch a melodramatic documentary and then an excellent guide shows you around an exhibition of the artefacts that were found with her (NB: Juanita is a given name, the Incas didn’t write so no evidence of her true name exists). These explain (via the guide) how she was sacrificed — with a sharp blow to the back of the head while drunk on alcohol — and that she was likely to have come from a high-born family, that being chosen for sacrifice would have been a great honour. She was around fourteen years old. Two other mummies were found at the same site and are thought to have been even younger when they died, supposedly of altitude before they even reached the top (they are not displayed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually you’re ushered into a cold dark room for your audience with the ice princess. It was strange because at this point it struck me that I was looking at the mummified corpse of a young girl in a freezer. The context builds up this person in the abstract but when confronted with her you lose all that for a moment, it all gets stripped away. The context matters a lot to the world at large, from it we know that (among other things): the Incas practiced child sacrifice; they made beautiful objects to honour the dead; they were able to tackle mountains that modern climbers require oxygen to cope with; her DNA tells us about who her (indirect) descendents might be today; and so on… And yet it was just so sad to see her frozen there in what looked to all the world like a supermarket freezer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after seeing Juanita the return of my stomach bug really began to take hold and ruin my evening. We found out that we’d have to leave at 3am to head for Colca Canyon so we took down our tents with the aim of sleeping in the rose garden. Eventually I didn’t get that far and so I slept in the lobby on a sofa next to the christmas tree (despite the protests of the porter who I think just disliked my snoring). When everyone left at 3am I moved into one of the rooms that the non-campers had upgraded to and slept till 11am (as much as my stomach would allow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I didn’t do too much. The driver Alfonso took care of me. He took me to the supermarket and instructed me to buy lots of 7up and bland crackers. After that we went to an Argentinian parilla for plain grilled chicken, white rice and boiled potatoes. It felt like a lot of food but it was welcome (I was taking tablets kept it from, shall we say, escaping…). We spent the rest of the day watching football in the room and left early the next morning at 5am. This was the first time that the sky had been clear enough to see the true extent of the volcano that looms over the city. So even though I was sick, I was still able to see something great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey up to the meeting point was beautiful too, up through the Andes once more — though there is an awful lot of litter strewn along the sides of the roads and a lot of graffiti sprayed on to the rocks. Sometimes the graffiti are political but, as everywhere, some are proclamations of love of one kind or another. It got me thinking — because I perceive spraying a rock with words to be a mainly male activity — whether all the messages of the form “te amo (insert male name)” were in fact expressions of homosexual affairs that are taboo, particularly in the poorer parts of South America&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we made it to the meeting point. It was cold, but beautiful. Not as pretty as the canyon but never mind. I took some pictures and chatted with some local stray dogs, who all preferred Alfonso’s more engaging approach to communicating with them. One brought me a “gift” of half of a broken mug — the crap that finds its way halfway up the Andes! For a while I read my book (as my iPod was broken, see notes). When the group came back they all looked knackered but I felt much better simply because everyone seemed so pleased to see me again. “Yeah I’m feeling much better”, I half-lied. Well, you’ve got to fake it to make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey that followed was (for me) probably the worst of the trip so far (time of writing: February 10th) because it just dragged and I couldn’t really sleep. If you take any kind of drug that stops you from excreting, it makes your stomach feel a particular peculiar and grotty sensation. You end up in a really bad mood. We managed to get to Cusco just after dark and needed to take a transfer even then. Fortunately the hotel was great and after dinner (another modest pollo a la plancha y arroz blanco) I went back and crashed out. When I got up in the night I rattled as I shivered but the bed was nice and warm at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day I finally saw a doctor about my stomach (about £35). I got sent to the pharmacy for antibiotics (about £15). I was scared that I wouldn’t make the Inca trail but the doctor told me I was in decent shape apart from the bowel infection. With this endorsement I was raring to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with instructions on what foods to (temporarily) avoid and the antibiotics, I soon began to feel better. The days I spent in Cusco were mostly just resting up ahead of the impending Inca trail. I found a lovely alpaca hoodie that accompanied me up to Macchu Pichu (spoiler: I made it!) and down to Patagonia too. I also visited the impressive Cathedral with its magnificent collection of religious art that comes with local additions like giving Judas Pizarro’s face and a roast guinea pig being served at the last supper. I didn’t go in for it (I wasn’t up to it and couldn’t drink on the antibiotics) but in Cusco you can party in a major way as there are all manner of nightclubs and bars that will allow you to drink and dance all night. I know this from my bleary-eyed fellow Tucans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;On the third full day I went up to the view point and remembered on the way back that I really don’t like descending steep stone stairs (esp. not on my own), a situation not helped when five stray-seeming dogs appeared and started to bark at me! Eventually their octogenarian owner showed up (shuffling down the stairs much faster than me!) and surprised me by asking me questions in English. He told his barking dogs to be quiet and he told me their names but I’ve forgotten them now. After that I met some other Tucans on the street and went to Jack’s Cafe: if you’re ever in Cusco and are in need of regeneration of any kind, go there because you won’t regret it! It rained after lunch, so I spent the afternoon in the hotel lobby watching “The Dark Knight” as dubbed into Spanish (so I still don’t remember/understand the end of that movie!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we were introduced to Santi, our guide for the Inca trail. An amiable chap (as anyone who wants to get you up the equivalent of Snowdon in one morning has to be), he explained the trail to us in a way that made it all seem very doable. As I packed that night I finally&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; felt excited about doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-notes&quot;&gt;Other notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_8/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the way to Arequipa, I was playing music in the cab of the truck and cranked the nano up to full volume for several hours. Apparently the newer ipods have a failsafe that kicks in after a few hours at full volume and won’t play the next time you use it. Who knew? I didn’t and I ended up introducing a more mechanical fault to my ipod by attempting to clean out the headphone jack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I bought some antihistamines in Arequipa that proved to be effective at reducing the itchiness of insect bites &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; getting me to sleep deeply. I’d say it’s fifty-fifty now what I actually take these tablets for.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I lost my headphones and their little tin at a gas station on the way to Arequipa. Fortunately (strangely?) I had a backup tin and was able to find a nice pair of blue headphones in Arequipa to match my (now malfunctioning) ipod.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even the smallest attempt at speaking Spanish reaps its own reward. I didn’t even haggle for my hoodie but because we’d had a nice chat she knocked off ten soles (about £2.50) anyway - either that or I’m a bigger rube than I thought.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;grumble-grumble&quot;&gt;posted about being sick&lt;/a&gt;, Mia, a friend of mine from sixth form, posted on facebook about a place called Heidi’s. Our waiter was amazing and the food was lovely (though not quite what I should have been eating at the time). I will spread Mia’s recommendation onwards: if you’re in Cusco look this place up - if only to try the happiness tea! (Waiter: “It’s good for the mind and the body. If you have a soul it will definitely be good for that too.”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “comfort” of a hotel/campsite has nothing to do with the quality of the beds or the pitches, and everything to do with the availability of hot water. (And the cleanliness of the toilets.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Because by this point, I was at peak alpaca: almost past looking at woolen products altogether. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s soft but not a whole lot better than baby alpaca (also expensive), the cost seems to be a result of scarcity than wholly due to quality. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;She’s been moved around a lot since she was discovered, including an extended, and not exactly diplomatically welcome, stay in Japan. I don’t know if I understood correctly but I think she is moving again soon. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Well I suppose you could fake people being in love with you to enhance your rep? Who is this Matt whose name ladies all over the Andes have been spraying on to the rocks? He sounds like a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;hunk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the preceding weeks as I struggled with the bowel infection, I’d begun to dread it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>South America, Part 7</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-7"/>
   <updated>2014-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-7</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next up was a piecemeal section of the trip that took in a varied set of sights and helped us get to know the new passengers who joined in Lima. On the first day we took a boat trip out to the Ballestas Islands, a nature reserve that is informally known as “the poor man’s galapagos”. Living there are penguins, sea birds, sea lions and seals. The speed boat out was a little wet and wild (and in fact the return trip was even wetter and wilder) so we all got soaked (twice) but the microclimate around the islands themselves was calm and warm, and we all got good value out of our cameras (if they still worked that is). We even saw a pelican get taken down by a sea-lion which was an interesting if not altogether pleasant display of nature red in tooth and claw. Also, who knew that guano was so valuable?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On pretty much any day you see penguins before lunch your afternoon is bound to be a little disappointing but a trip out into the sand dunes near to Pisco  didn’t do too badly at keeping up the entertainment factor. It was a bit tough to walk around in the dust storms - and being ferried from one point to another to then wander aimlessly was a bit underwhelming - but I got some good focus and managed to get some pictures (albeit at a rather long distance) of flamingos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pisco itself is a rather small town now (a tsunami wiped out most of the town out in 2009) and there isn’t much to see there. We entertained ourselves by looking for items for the upcoming “something you would never wear” party at Puerto Inca and three of us then chose a hotel that wasn’t our own as somewhere to have dinner. Unfortunately we were all a little tired and had to explain to our poor waitress why none of us had got more than halfway through our mains. I’d been up all night the previous night as one of my room-mates had drunk snored the whole time and so I was totally wiped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I felt a bit unwell as we made our way to Huacachina, which was the last surviving oasis in South America (though just like all the others it is no longer an oasis and now has water piped in from elsewhere) and is basically a gringo trap designed to get tourists to go dune buggy riding. I decided to explore the town instead. It was warm, sunny, and looked very pretty, but beyond that there wasn’t much to see. I had an Inka Kola at a café, chatted to some newcomers (Maz and Luke), put a snapshot of the main pond/lake up on Facebook, and that was pretty much it apart from also managing to find my something that I would never wear for the party - pretty much the ugliest pair of swimmers I’d ever seen for about £2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the dune buggies returned, we headed on to Nazca. En route we stopped off  at a viewing platform (the nicely named “Torre Metallica” - presumably you can also “Ride The Lightning” and maybe there’s a door on the back marked “Enter Sandman”?) on the Trans-American Highway where you can pay a couple of Soles to see two of the famous Nazca lines from about 100 feet off the ground. Being earmarked to fly over them the next day I decided not to bother. I did manage to grab a postcard featuring all the lines though as I thought it might be useful for future reference. I sent it to my parents for safe-keeping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campsite was at a nice enough hotel but it was somewhat isolated from the rest of Nazca by being along a long (and boy was it long - about a mile or so at least) dirt road. But at least it had a pool. No warm showers, but I was almost used to that by this point. My only issue was now having a tent mate who got drunk and attempted to cuddle me when I got back to the tent! Well, that and needing to go to the toilet all night (and they were miles away!) - but at least that got me looking up at the stars when I finally gave in and used a bush instead. It was very dark that far away from the town and as the dogs barked in the night, I gazed up at the Milky Way for only about the fourth or fifth time in my life. Earlier in the evening we’d been to a planetarium and had the [Nazca lines” image_path=”) explained to us. It was very relaxing, though the constantly following a laser pointer for an hour made me feel a bit like a cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking of cats, I gave up on trying to sleep at around 5am. It was light by then and warm enough to try to wrestle myself onto the wi-fi with my iPad - something that I didn’t actually manage to do. Instead I sat down and wrote a postcard to my parents, whilst all the time being attacked by a kitten who thought my pen was something that should be hunted. It was a nice way to while away the time until everyone was awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That morning we set out for Nazca airport and checked in for our flights over the lines. I was quite disturbed by the fact that they weighed us (though I guess I should be relieved that they were that meticulous) and I hadn’t dropped a single kilo since leaving home. I got put on the first flight and with some folks I get on really well with, which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines are really quite crazy. The geometric creations alone are pretty amazing but the ones in shapes that can only be properly appreciated from the air are truly staggering. Admittedly they are shapes that can be conceived of with reference to the surroundings (after all, you could write your name in large letters on a beach) but the fact they have persisted so long is what ensures their notoriety. Alas I did rather ignore the pilot’s instructions regarding where to point my camera (just under my wing, apparently) and so by the time we had got around all the lines I had gotten decidedly queasy.  Fortunately a few sweets back on the ground got me fighting fit and I was feeling okay by the time we left Nazca at 2pm. Given the pictures I was able to snap, I think it was worth it! Inspired by writing my postcard, I even phoned home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to Puerto Inca we stopped off at the [Chauchilla cemetery” image_path=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauchilla_Cemetery) where mummies were discovered in 1920. Apart from the obvious macabre intrigue of these skeletons sat in pits dressed as they had been long ago (since the 9th century) preserved by sand and heat, there was little context for what was there and so it was just a strange walk in the heat with no real information gained. I learned more about the mummies from wikipedia while writing this post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puerto Inca is, as you might guess, an Inca port. On the hills surrounding the hotel and campsite on the main beach there are ruins of an old Inca fishing port. The Incas used a sequence of runners stood 7km apart to deliver goods up to the Inca capital of Cuzco high up in the mountains: the goods could be delivered in 24 hours, crucial to maintaining the empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_7/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I upgraded to a cabin because I was feeling sick. The good news was that there was hot water, the bad news was that there was no fresh water. A salty shower is an interesting experience but it was still better than my frozen attempts to get sand off myself with cold water in Punta Sal. We had a barbecue on the beach and all wore our things we would never wear. Obviously I skipped the alcohol but there were a lot of sore heads the following morning. I explored the surroundings the next afternoon and then in the evening lost heavily at Monopoly. At 9pm I was one of the last to go to bed!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>South America, Part 6</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-6"/>
   <updated>2014-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/south-america-trip-part-6</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From Punta Sal we took a long driving down to Huanchaco, via a stop off at the Lord of Saipan museum. The lord of Saipan is a Moche mummy found dressed in all manner of gold and surrounded by artefacts and other sacrifices (including other humans and decapitated llamas). The tour took a while to get going (our guide was late) but the exhibition was so amazing (the pieces were painstakingly restored in Germany) that it was hugely enjoyable. The diorama at the end featuring moving animatronic waxworks of Moche people was extremely weird though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuation of the journey to Hunchaco took until after dark and we had to pitch our tents under flood lights. After that we went out for enormous pizzas at a bar next door to the camp site and my fellow tour mates also took advantage of some rather well priced (and strong!) cocktails. I stuck to Sprite! The camp site at Huanchaco was small but I had a nice pitch and the toilets and showers were clean. I had a cold water shave that night (using my phone´s front facing camera as a mirror) and a nice warm shower the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There´s not much to see at Huanchaco, it´s a bit of a gringo trap with bars and restaurants for people who don´t really like the look of nearby Trujillo. In the morning we took a trip through Trujillo to the temple of the sun and the temple of the moon. These two Moche structures from around 5-900AD are the most complete remains of a city complex that was discovered after the El Nino rains in 1987. The temple of the sun is currently closed for restoration but the temple of the moon was spectacular, a fantastic Russian Doll structure that the Moche would just bury and build on top of every hundred years. The layers are well preserved and show evidence of ongoing human sacrifice, until the whole civilisation collapsed (probably due to El Nino too) around 900AD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_6/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where did the Moche people go? Well, they became the Chimu and built a massive mud city on the other side of what is today Trujillo. That city was called Chan Chan and spanned over 200 square kilometres by the 1100s. Learning about Chan Chan was pretty much what made me want to come to South America and how I found this Tucan trip going all the way around the continent. Most of Chan Chan is washed away and gone now, either built upon (as lost cities often are) or just left as a bare expanse of potential archeological exploration roved over by morning mists, stray dogs and abandoned plastic bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is one spectacular site that remains - the palace of one of Chan Chan´s final ruler kings (immature side note: “this palace was for one king” sounds unfortunately like something else when said with a Spanish accent), of which there were many. These palaces were built by each king during their lifetimes with the specific aim of storing their mummy after they died. The entire palace was devoted to display of the king´s mummy each year on the anniversary of their death, a tradition that persisted for a long time in other later South American cultures too. It would have had walls two metres tall and would have looked awesome in its day, especially given how it does even now after centuries of erosion. I liked it so much I bought the T-shirt! Even better was how our tour party was mobbed by a group of Peruvian school children who wanted only to pose with us for pictures! It took us about half an hour to leave. Naturally I took my new responsibilities seriously and told them to recognise the importance of their education, the value of socialised medicine and their duty to elect left wing governments when they were older!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_6/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_6/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_6/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we left at 6am for Peru´s capital Lima. Again we stopped off at an archeological site but it was less interesting than the others we had previously visited (quite disappointing really) and was only remarkable for the fact that we had lunch there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lima seems to sprawl even more than Quito does. From about 10km out you start to see shanty towns and they are strikingly well organised for all the chaos that the phrase evokes. We passed places where the rudimentary houses (little more than beach huts=) were yet to be built and there was evidence that power and water were already in place - all people had to do was to move in and take their plot. I found myself wondering a lot about what life must be like for those people, to be so poor and live so close to the wealth of the capital. Obviously I had no chance to wander those streets as everyone tells you that it is not safe - I wonder whether it´s not more likely to be the case that the powers-that-be aren´t more than a little ashamed of the situation and don´t want you to be aware of it (and of course, the dubious touristification of poverty - tours of favelas in Rio et al - is another thing to consider).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_6/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the shanty towns and at the interior of Lima, a bright and beautiful colonial city awaits. The food and the bars didn´t strike me as anything special, but there were nice churches and busy streets to explore. On the second full day Lee and I took the Metro down to a suburb called Miraflores and there, for the first time on the tour, we could have been back in Europe. This was perhaps the starkest evocation of the social and economic inequality in Peru (and elsewhere in South America). It was one thing to drive through towns where people were burning trash at the edge of town but quite another to find somewhere just like Europe. Sometimes we “forgive” extreme poverty because we have that post-colonial first world thought that “they can´t do any better” - Miraflores was a lovely day out but it made me uncomfortable because clearly some people in Peru have a very high standard of living just miles from people in shanty towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_6/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_6/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_6/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is part 7, where a lot happens - even without me getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After Cuenca we set off for the Peruvian border. One of the great advantages of having a UK passport in South America is that you don’t need any visas. If you’re Australian or Canadian it’s a different story. Nevertheless we all got over the border with very little trouble (the third ever land border crossing of my life) apart from the bits where they seem to make you wait in a queue just for the sake of making you wait in a queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_5/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_5/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change in scenery after leaving Ecuador (tropical forest) and crossing over into Peru was quite stark, there was an instant switch to a desert landscape. The towns also looked instantly poorer and the on-truck tutorial on how to detect fake Peruvian currency made me wonder what on earth we were getting into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first point of stay was Punta Sal, a beach resort near Mancora in northern Peru. It’s situated at the point where the cold Humboldt current that comes up from Antartica meets the hotter currents coming down from the north. This meant that the sea was very pleasant while the wide stretches of sand were very pretty and very warm. (Perhaps I little too warm, I couldn’t walk barefoot at midday.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_5/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_5/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day we needed new currency (Peruvian Nuevo soles - about 4.5 to a £1) so we took a taxi to Mancora to be astounded by this one horse town swarming with tuk tuks. After that I just chilled on the beach despite only having a really low pressure cold shower to get the sand off things. It was also a great opportunity to test out the sunset mode on my camera as you can see from the pictures below!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After Baños, we set off for Cuenca, which is a town in the south of Ecuador. Being a long drive, the journey was broken up with our first excursion to some inca ruins, a large complex at Ingapirca with a sun temple. It was built on an earlier site that dated back to about the 9th century and the Inca then conquered the area and built on top of it, as they tended to while their empire was expanding out from Peru to the south in the 11th and 12th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/IngapircaPano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Roman ruins in Britain, what you end up seeing is a reconstruction that acknowledges the presence and work of the Incas (and their precursors) but is still a reconstruction nonetheless. However the Sun Temple is still original and when you imagine the rest of the site with two metre tall stone walls - which is not hard to do - it is very impressive. Had the Spanish been more enlightened conquerors, we may have even more to see today at sites like Ingapirca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing south to Cuenca, we arrived so late that there was little time for anything more than a bare bones tour before we went to dinner. Very few places were open on Sunday night, so I settled for chicken and chips from a modest Arabic place on the main drag of restaurants and cafés.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day was sunny and revealed Cuenca to have a beautiful colonial heart, epitomised by the newer three domed cathedral. You can visit the roof but not on Mondays. We went on the bus tour around the city and this included a trip to viewpoint that showed the massive sprawl of the city below. Sprawling out into to all available space seems to be a common feature of cities in Ecuador - perhaps I am being naive, maybe most cities in the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; are like this - but unlike Quito or Otavalo, Cuenca really felt like somewhere you could actually move to and live well there. Apparently it is popular with rich Americans who like the cheap property prices and shared currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lunch we had some delicious tapas and after that we went shopping. I tried to find some more shorts because the warm weather was proving enjoyable (and besides I was still washing the amazon out of one pair!) but unfortunately they didn’t have my size. After more frustrations with the ATM I went back to the hotel and discovered via the wifi that the bank thought I was going to the USA for six months. Good job I discovered that before I got into Peru!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_4/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening it rained and Lee and I ducked into a random church for mass. I didn’t really understand what was going on but I liked the music and the message seemed to be that with Christmas coming, this was a time of hope. Dinner was in minor establishment and the food was underwhelming - but watching Ecuadorean news on the TV was entertaining and as we settled our bill we had a good chat with the owner about all the pictures of footballers he had on the wall. The only English player there was Bobby Charlton… of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we left Cuenca early, setting out for our first land border crossing of the tour: from Ecuador to Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We left Misahualli for Baños via an hour in nearby Tena to get something for the truck fixed. After that the drive to Banos was pretty short - or at least it seemed that way as I alternated between dozing off, snapping the scenery and… well… dozing off some more. We arrived at a campsite about twenty minutes taxi ride from Banos and this was it, the thing I’d feared most about this trip: the camping. Fortunately, as an odd boy, I managed to secure my own tent - the gadget palace that you can see in my selfie! Getting the tent up was straightforward and all my assorted camping gear seemed to live up to requirements! It chucked it down with rain in the night, so it was good that the fly sheet did it’s job too. It was great fun to lie there listening to the rain, nice and warm and dry. More importantly, I also managed to get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_3/TentSelfie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day, we had lunch at the campsite and then went to a nearby waterfall. Banos is a spa town (much like its English namesake) and has many waterfalls in the surrounding countryside. This one, the something del diablo, was very impressive. We had to canyon our way through some tight-ish caves for about two minutes and were rewarded with a spectacular torrent to be photographed beneath. At that point I hadn’t learnt how quickly things dry in South America, so I cracked out the poncho like a wuss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went into Baños proper and had fun and games trying to get a cash machine to give us money, before having a coffee and a really nice lunch at a café whose name escapes me now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things about Baños: it’s surrounded by waterfalls and there’s also an active volcano nearby. Sometimes it smokes, sometimes there’s a small amount of lava, but there was no activity while we were there. Our interest was confined to noting the escape routes on the tourist map and to attempting to walk up to see it. The walk was fun but pretty tough going so we didn’t get all the way up to the volcano. We did get some lovely photos of Baños though. On the way back down we encountered one of the best sights of the tour so far, a school marching band practising. I tried taking a video with my camera but I messed it up in an attempt to be covert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In town Lee and I got our hair cut, and then we got some supplies from the supermarket. We then bumped into our driver and helped him collect the repaired tents from the store. We all bundled into a taxi back to the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to another waterfall and then went back for more empanadas (a sort of deep fried pasty - I went for cheese and veggie, then we shared a chocolate and banana one). I spent the afternoon hand washing some clothes that got filthy in the amazon and trying to sort out my bags. Another night of filthy rain (during which my sister Tilli facetimed me in my tent at 2.30am!) followed before we got up at six to take down the tents and depart for Cuenca.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit behind in my posts about the trip and this post interrupts the sequence of events somewhat, just because I’ve not felt that well and that has dominated my thoughts about what to write. Basically for a week or two I’ve had varying degrees of bellyache and it’s not been fun. Instead of feeling the gratitude and excitement I’ve felt since being here, I’ve spent a lot of time wanting to curl up in the corner and just be… well… somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this was bound to happen at some point. Even if I had stayed at home, there would have been some point in the next five months where I would feel just as terrible. Maybe not physically, but definitely mentally - there is nothing so tiring as trying to maintain the facade of being alright when you’re not. In fact, that may be the reason why I’m so obsessed with writing about it now - because up until Lima I genuinely felt as though the old Matt had melted away somewhat and I was just getting used to being, if not a new person, then at least a better version of the person I always was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am in Cuzco. It took us fifteen hours to get here - well it took me fifteen hours to get here as I’d stayed behind in Arequipa with our driver Alfonso who was looking after me (my recent troubles came to a head on the last night in Arequipa so I missed a trip to Colca canyon, one of the things I had most looked forward to). Arequipa to Cuzco was a bum-numbing trip but all the way it was beautiful. It was about 500km but because it was through lots of Andean plateaus and on some of the more terrible roads we have encountered it just dragged. The general rule seems to be that the prettier the scenery is, the longer the journey. It’s been a great journey for my camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuzco is at altitude. The fuzziness of the head has worn off now but it is really cold. Actually I don’t know about really cold but it is certainly the coldest I have been on this trip - it certainly feels like it is December at last. I’m not going to do much today and I may even come back to this terrible pc (running windows xp and internet explorer 7 - AGGGHHH!) to write up some more posts. It’s sunny and an orientation walk is imminent so I may end up changing my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll wrap up here though I did also want to write a few words about how great it is to be travelling with a group in situations like this and also about whether being on this trip really brings you closer to the places you visit. Perhaps I will get the chance to do that later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;otavalo&quot;&gt;Otavalo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday (24th November) was our first day of travel and involved a four hour trip to Otavalo, a town to the north of Quito that is famous for its market… on &lt;em&gt;Saturdays&lt;/em&gt;. The journey got us better acquainted with travel on our truck Magaly and we encountered a few of the little hiccups that are a natural part of travelling this way: power lines crashing down on to the highway, driver of your truck asking a policeman to take a photo of your truck snagged under the wires, wrong turns, and - funniest of all - getting a whole block’s worth of concerned locals to watch as your truck tries to turn a corner. Magaly is a wonderful truck, but subtle she is not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the market not quite being as enormous as advertised our tour leader arranged for a trip to some local highlights. Before that I had a blackberry pie (blackberries seem to be very popular here in Ecuador) and bought a lovely blue Alpaca wool blanket that I figure I will need on the chillier moments of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip really crammed in a lot of stuff. There was a visit to a waterfall that’s very important to the local Quechwa people, then there we visited a crater lake but unfortunately by this point the weather had turned wet and cold and I was wearing just a t-shirt. The boat trip around the lake was about the coldest I had been in a long while - including when I got hailed on during my last day in Hendon! After that we went to a suburb famous for cheap leather but most of us didn’t really need any so we settled in a cafe for a much needed coffee. Finally we went to meet a family that produces woven products - the kind that we’d seen in the market earlier on. I sort of regretted my earlier purchase because there was an even nicer blanket, though this one did cost significantly more and I didn’t want to blow my budget too early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_2/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_2/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_2/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got back so late that Neinke (our tour leader) was a bit worried about where we had got to. I dashed across the road for fried chicken (I know, I should do better!) before hitting the hay. I hardly spent any time at the hotel where we were staying, which was a shame because it was a really nice place. I would have at least liked to have swayed in the hammocks for a bit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;across-the-andes-towards-misahualli&quot;&gt;Across the Andes, towards Misahualli&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day involved another early start as we left at 6.30am for Misahualli, which is in the Ecuadorian Amazon region. After our first piss stop, I rode up front with our driver Alfonso and spent about two hours gasping in awe as we went over the Andes in the big truck. We had to stop a couple of times because of some dodgy readings about the balance in the truck and another time because we had misinterpreted where some road works had ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roads over the Andes linking Quito to Tena are still being built and the sheer scale of their construction was as interesting to look at as the astounding scenery. Great swathes of mountain passes are being gouged out and roads laid in these cuttings. In about five to ten years time there will be a dual carriageway over the mountains and this will make a massive difference to people who are currently (as we were) forced to make an incredibly long journey over a short distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a stack of photos as we crossed the mountain passes, here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_2/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_2/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misahualli-day-one-positive-energy-and-impromptu-canyoning&quot;&gt;Misahualli Day One: Positive energy and impromptu canyoning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we arrived at Misahualli, we had to dig shorts out of our bags and dress for canyoning. Fortunately we are all given gumboots and had plenty of time to slap on sunblock and Deet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first the walk seemed rather sedate with all the usual pointing out of wildlife and what have you. I tried some lemon ants, and guess what? They were lemony! They wriggled a bit too. So that was all pretty good, but then came the water! My sense of balance is terrible. Asking me to straddle rocks and put my hands in particular places and trust in how my weight shifts from one position to another is usually a big no no. That said, by the end - after enduring all manner of cuts and scrapes - I did feel a bit better about doing it. The turning point was the waterfall. It took all of us a long time to get all of us up there and I took heart from the fact that everyone needed at least a bit of a hand. After that getting through the caves with the bats and their guano was easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to the hotel I was covered in mud and bat shit and god knows what else, so it was straight into  the shower and then                   after that straight into the swimming pool. Neither had particularly hot water, but it didn’t really matter because it was pretty warm outside. We had a nice dinner and then we were introduced to a tarantula - I forget his name. I let him crawl over my face and if I’m honest it was nice to have him sat on my face than to watch him crawl all over someone else’s! After that we all had a few cocktails and I went to bed only to find a massive cockroach-like creature in the room. Apparently our room had a tarantula nest above it, but I never saw one - though other people did find them in the rooms while we were staying there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misahualli-day-two-when-is-a-canoe-not-a-canoe&quot;&gt;Misahualli Day Two: When is a canoe not a canoe?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day in Misahualli was much more chilled out. We set off on the back of jeeps to the Napo river and sailed down in motorised canoes (boats I guess!) to a museum of Quechwa culture - basically a lot of different hunting traps and some more explanations of native life. We got to fire a blow gun too. I was so determined to blow hard enough that I completely missed the target! I sent the dart a decent distance though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we set off in the “canoe” again and visited an animal sanctuary. They take in animals that the Ecuadorean government rescues - either because they are being kept illegally as pets or because they’ve been discovered injured. Most of the animals there are unable to return to the wild, which is a shame, but it is a good way to see the animals without traipsing into their habitat and disturbing them there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we had a late lunch (including popcorn in soup - try it, it works!) and then visited the town of Misahualli to see some Capuchin monkeys. They really are the epitome of cheeky monkeys, they stole Angela’s mosquito repellent from her bag and tried to spray it everywhere. Another one stole some chicken from a grill and started throwing it from a tree above us. What they really like are onions, if you give them half an onion they will sit there and smear it all over themselves in order to protect against mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night there was a massive thunderstorm, quite unlike any other that I have experienced, more for it’s duration than for its intensity or ferocity. I sat there in the dark and filmed a bit, so I may put that video up at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_2/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misahualli-day-three-tubing-mosquito-bites-moonshine-and-mud&quot;&gt;Misahualli Day Three: Tubing, mosquito bites, moonshine, and mud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last full day in Misahualli, we went tubing down the Napo river. In the morning it was cold and rainy, so it was not quite the relaxing experience that it could have been. Part of the problem is having to dunk your arse in the river for  duration. Worse still, you can’t pee in the river for fear that a parasite will swim up your urethra and grow there (seriously, they have to be surgically removed - ouch!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After forty minutes we stopped off to visit a native village where we ate grubs and had a steamed fish - tilapia - for lunch. The fish was delicious, and the grubs were surprisingly tasty once they were cooked. We were offered the chance to eat them raw but they looked just too big and juicy to contemplate it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining tubing was rather uneventful but fortunately took place in strong warm sunshine. We stopped off at an island half way back and it was at this point that I noticed that I had been quite badly bitten by mosquitos and my feet also got a bit sunburned - I think both of these happened because my various creams and sprays got washed off by the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a fun day because I’d never really heard of tubing before and it was pretty relaxing to skim down the river that way, especially once the weather improved. Boy did I suffer later from those mossie bites and that sunburn on my feet though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/south_america/part_2/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By the time this goes up, I will be at least a week in to my South American tour. I flew out to Ecuador last Thursday (the 21st) and ended up being awake for more than twenty four hours. My flight left London early and I had a three hour stopover in Madrid, then a twelve hour flight onward to Quito. My bag didn’t leave Madrid though, so we were separated for about twenty four nerve-racking hours. Luckily, I’d packed a change of clothes and so I was still able to explore Quito with Lee and Miriam (fellow Tucan travellers) the next day without too much discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quito is an interesting city crammed full of crazy drivers. From the taxi from the airport and beyond, my time in the city was mostly defined by the sound of car horns. It’s mostly just the tendency to use the horn to let people know that they are there, which is a bit different to those of us are used to it being used in anger. To some extent, I considered getting beeped a sign of getting acclimatised to the city and once I’d got used to the traffic flow (i.e realising for the fifteenth time that day that the traffic goes along on the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;…) I was ducking and weaving with the best of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first full day, I went with Lee and Miriam into the city and explored the old town. It is full of colonial architecture and painted all sorts of different colours. With no expectation of what it would be like, I enjoyed the whirl of new colours and sensations. From people selling anything and everything in the streets to the various churches that we ducked into, it was a completely new experience for me. A nice find was a museum of Pre-Colombian art with a collection that surpasses any I’ve seen up until now, with lots of beautiful pieces that sum up tribal life - bowls, statues of shamans, etc - not to mention a lot more sexually explicit material than you’d see at the dear old British Museum - no Victorian-era chipping off of phalluses in Ecuador!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The churches were interesting too. We went into four and the range of stylings of various aspects of the churches was very curious indeed. I don’t pretend to be an expert on Catholic churches but you tend to get a massive ornamental central nave leading down to the main alter and along the sides you get individual stations of prayer to particular saints. It was the upkeep of these stations that was of greatest interest, as in some of the churches they were being filled with all manner of chintz like helium balloons, kewpie dolls and LED lights. Even in the Basilica we giggled as we saw an “LED Jesus”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, we met our tour guide Neinke and the Tucan travel vehicle (a truck, definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a bus!) arrived at the hotel. I haven’t said a great deal about the hotel and perhaps it’s better not to! I think the only reason Tucan use them is because it is close to the centre of the city while having somewhere secure to park the truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my second full day (this was the first day of the tour but this only featured a meeting at around 6pm) my bag had arrived, so after I packed my rucksack, we walked up to a cable car up at the top of one of the hills around Quito. It was tough going and I certainly felt the effects of altitude as we went. Quito is at about 2400m and the volcano at the top of the cable car is at 4100m - so I think we climbed about 900m on our walk and I certainly felt the last fifty or so! The weather plays a massive role in how good a view you get from the cable car and the viewpoints at the top. We were lucky enough that - although it was rather misty - the cloud did at least come in and out so we could see the sprawl of Quito down below. It was at this point that I realised just how massive Quito is (there’s only one other really large city in the country), a huge conurbation that sprawls over all the available space. (To be fair, I’d had hints during the long taxi ride two evenings earlier.) At the top there was also a little chapel, allowing more observation of how communities influence their churches in this country - this time we noticed that large pieces of artwork had also become a collage of photos inserted behind them. I certainly felt the effects of altitude at this point and I think we all did, as we ordered a taxi onward to our next destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was “Mitad del Mundo”, the line of lattitude that runs around the middle of the world. There are two places that you can visit in the area: one features a big monument, lots of flags, and lots of restaurants with proprietors begging you to come in; and the other is a smaller place that focusses on the native culture of the region and on the scientific experiments that can only be done at the equator. While the former is good for snaps and looks impressive in the sunshine, it is much better to venture two hundred metres up the road to the Inki Solar museum and go for one of their tours. We were a bit short on time, which was a shame as there was a lot more to see and our guide (Carlos) had a lot of interesting demonstrations. I have a video that I will put up on the site when I get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening we met everyone on the tour. There are six of us doing the whole six months, while the rest leave later on - most after three months at Rio. Some more people will  join us in Lima for the section up to Rio and perhaps even beyond. At the moment there are eighteen people on the truck. As you might expect the majority are Aussies and Brits, but there are also Belgian, Dutch, and Canadian travellers with us. It’s a nice age range too, some retirees along with people of typical travelling age, which seems to be late twenties for women and late thirties for the guys. I think I am pretty much the only “virgin” tourer and from my conversations, there definitely seems to be a “travel bug” (is $R_0&amp;gt;1$? - we’ll find out on this tour!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, October 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-october-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-october-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Four great albums this month for the last album digest in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chvrches-the-bones-of-what-you-believe&quot;&gt;CHVRCHES “The Bones Of What You Believe”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first got into CHVRCHES on Record Store Day, one of my purchases was an Irn Bru coloured 12” of the Recover EP that, according to eBay, tripled in value over night. Judging by this, their full debut, my see-through orange slab of happiness may hold its value, because it’s clear that CHVRCHES should be around for the long haul. “The Bones Of What You Believe” is a master class in upbeat pop songwriting that doesn’t have to pander to the lowest common denominator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact the only real flaw in this album is that it might be slightly &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; relentless; while I was still getting to know the songs it was rather exhausting to listen to this slew of upbeat music and the album as a whole could do with a couple more changes of pace. As it is, the only slow song is the last one - although the two bonus songs on the limited edition (thanks Spotify!) are good enough and slow enough that their inclusion on the album proper could have a good album great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality is consistently high but the best tracks are the ones already released as singles: “The Mother We Share”, “Recover”, and “Gun” which might be the best out-and-out pop song I’ve heard so far this year save for Vampire Weekend’s “Diane Young”. However, there’s some great supporting stuff in the rest of the track listing: “Lies” arrives at the point where the CHVRCHES formula begins to make sense and is appropriately euphoric; “Night Sky” is a wonderful song, though I did think it was “Nice Guy” for a while; and “Under The Tide” shows that there’s more than one vocalist in the band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it’s a good pop album and I’m really keen to see where they go next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;darkside-psychic&quot;&gt;DARKSIDE “Psychic”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m almost at the end of this first section of monthly album digests - a run of 34 consecutive monthly posts about at least three albums. Because I love music it has not been difficult to do and my skill at writing these puff pieces about albums I like has increased over this time. Early on I did find it a little difficult to find and write about enough albums and perhaps my biggest regret is the short shrift that I gave to Nicholas Jaar’s excellent album “Space Is Only Noise”, something that only happened because I simply hadn’t spent enough time listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DARKSIDE are a collaboration between Nicholas Jaar and guitarist Dave Harrington, and “Psychic” is their first proper album. In order to atone for past mistakes, I made sure that I listened to it &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; and it was a very rewarding experience. I said back in May that I thought that Vampire Weekend’s would probably be my favourite come the year’s end but I have to say that “Psychic” runs “Modern Vampires Of The City” pretty close. Of course it does this in spite of (or perhaps because of) being a completely different kettle of fish. While “Psychic” is a bit less electronic than “Space Is Only Noise”, it certainly operates in a similar way - presenting music that is exploded into its constituent elements and explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a very mellow and spacious album that seems to unfold in a different way with each listen. The highlights are “Golden Arrow” - a glorious 11 minute deconstruction in which the remains of who knows what kind of track are smeared around your headphones - and “Metatron”, which closes the album and is probably the closest thing to a recognisable song here. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-tet-beautiful-rewind&quot;&gt;Four Tet “Beautiful Rewind”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fine album from Four Tet this, it is more like “There Is Love In You” than last July’s singles collection “Pink”. All the tracks are quite short and the whole forty minutes flies by, ebbing and flowing in that wonderful Four Tet way. When I went to see Radiohead in Spain back in 2002, Four Tet were the support act and I bought a t-shirt in celebration of this (I’d been a massive Fridge fan). That shirt was emblazoned with the title of a track from his second album “Pause” - “Everything Is Alright”. I think it’s great that ten years on, he’s creating music that makes me feel just that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;haim-days-are-gone&quot;&gt;HAIM “Days Are Gone”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this album but I can’t think of anything interesting to say about it! And yes, I have listened to it a lot! Perhaps I just need to live with it a little more before it starts to mean something.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Only Chocolate Cake Recipe You’ll Ever Need</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/chocolate-cake-recipe"/>
   <updated>2013-10-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/chocolate-cake-recipe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/the-reset-button/&quot;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I baked a chocolate cake the other day and it was a great success. Here is the recipe, which is a trivial modification of one that appears in Nigel Slater’s “Real Food” (Amazon links: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-Food-Nigel-Slater/dp/1841151440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1382362805&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=nigel+slater+real+food&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Real-Food-Nigel-Slater/dp/1841151440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1382362827&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=nigel+slater+real+food&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;). “Real Food” is a cookbook that I genuinely treasure. The modification I have made for this recipe is to omit the espresso but I will point out where it should be added, in case you want to give that a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;180g fine dark chocolate, chopped. (Do not skimp on this in any way! I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Menier-Dark-Chocolate/10805011&quot;&gt;Nestlé’s Menier Dark Cooking Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;140g butter, diced.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 free range eggs, separated. (I hate this bit!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200g golden caster sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon baking powder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons cocoa powder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;90g plain flour. (Fun fact: I used gluten free flour and it had no ill effect on the cake as far as I could tell, so make one for your gluten intolerant friends! My friend said that it was the best gluten free cake that she had ever had!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 small espresso (about three tablespoons of very strong coffee - I’ve not ever used this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Line the base of a 8” springform cake tin with baking parchment, buttering the tin lightly so it stays in place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the chopped chocolate melting in a bain-marie (that is a bowl heating in a pan of boiling water) for two to three minutes (add the coffee in this time if you are bothering with it) and stir gently while adding the butter until everything has melted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer (definitely do this, it takes about half an hour and strong arms without one) until stiff, then fold in the sugar. Take care not to knock out too much air from the egg whites when you do this. In another bowl, mix the baking powder and the flour. You need lots of bowls on the go for this one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the chocolate off the heat, add the egg yolks and mix together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slowly add the chocolate mix to the egg white mix, again taking care to keep as much air in as possible. Last of all sift in the flour and cocoa powder mix.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir the whole mixture with a large metal spoon (I actually used my housemate’s wonderful rubbery cake spoon, it’s quite the marvel.) slowly and tenderly. The smell should get you going enough to want to take care of this baby. It will feel light and fluffy, you have to take care not to over mix it - just fold in the flour. Scoop into the lined tin, sigh gently, and bake in an oven preheated to 180ºC for thirty five of the most beautiful minutes of your life (in an aromatic sense).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let it cool in the tin before turning it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>LS Lowry At Tate Britain</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/ls-lowry-at-tate-britain"/>
   <updated>2013-10-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ls-lowry-at-tate-britain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feelings about this show. On the one hand, I like that there are depictions of working class Britain on display and I feel that it is right that these paintings are considered part of the British cultural canon. I also like that a lot of these paintings represent large gatherings of people, which are absent from a lot of what we might call the mainstream of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the problem with this show and, for me, with Lowry’s paintings in the main, is that the large crowds of people are almost devoid of meaning. It’s a sort of lazy pointillism of stick figures used to populate vast areas of canvas that would otherwise be empty. So while it is great that Lowry fills some of his paintings in this way (a great example being “Going To The Match”), I don’t think it works for every painting. (To be fair, not every painting is hyper-populated with stick figures, but the majority are.) I think in some paintings the presence of large numbers of his oft-caricatured matchstick figures make important points about large crowds of people and/or the dehumanizing effects of the industrial revolution on traditional working life. However, in other paintings the large gatherings of figures feel perfunctory or gimmicky – they’re there because the other paintings have them. Sometimes excessive homage can start to feel like satire or exploitation instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And boy are there a lot of paintings featuring those famous matchstick men (and on a Saturday afternoon there are also a lot of matchstick people crowded into the gallery to look at them all!) - it’s quite wearying in fact. An equivalent show would be &lt;a href=&quot;/lichtenstein-at-tate-modern/&quot;&gt;the Lichtenstein retrospective from earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which also had to present an artist with a signature style without making the works seem to repetitious or boring. When I think about the structure of both shows they are quite similar, which makes me think that the charisma of Lichtenstein’s work (or my response to it, I was really won over) may be what carried the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lowry show seems aware of the snootiness towards his work in the art world, the entirety of the second room concerns itself with comparing Lowry’s work to that of other artists engaged in the traditional artistic activity of representing modern life. There were works by Valette, Pissarro, and Utrillo hung next to equivalent Lowry paintings and for me I preferred the compared artist every time. Standing in front of Lowry’s painting of London (Piccadilly Circus I think) called to mind George Bellows’ piece set in a fictional New York square half a century before - and I realised then that &lt;a href=&quot;/george-bellows-at-ra/&quot;&gt;I’d enjoyed Bellows’ show more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Lowry and Bellows shows lionize their subjects for having depicted modern life in some way, but Bellows makes modern life (in America, about 30 to 50 years earlier than Lowry’s England) seem much more interesting and full of potential. Even in Bellows’ most industrial paintings – like the one where you can feel the chill of the snow as great skyscrapers are set to be erected out of impossibly large pits – the mood is still one of excitement, of great works being undertaken. In the Lowry paintings, he present a more dour outlook: evictions, fever vans, cripples, vast collections of smokestacks drifting off into an implied unseen horizon. It’s obvious to me that both artists occupy different social positions and have different views on their subject matter, and it’s certainly interesting to make the comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all said, there are some stunning paintings to see in this show. Most of them are in room 4, which is called “Ruined Landscape” and they depict the moors and slag pits of the industrial North with an unflinching grimness. Bereft of gimmicky matchstick men and endowed with a gruesome beauty, these are simply breathtaking landscapes that feature industry and its effluents eating into nature, to the point where the paintings seem like they are collapsing in on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another source of wonderful paintings is room 6, which collates the larger paintings from throughout Lowry’s career, On a larger scale the landscape seems to matter more and the people less, and so, to these eyes at least, these paintings seemed more balanced and more hopeful about the lives of their occupants. I’m sure that this is just a point of view as you could argue that industrial landscapes painted in the fifties and sixties that are barren and sparse seem quite sinister compared to those that teemed with people in the twenties and thirties. Go and have a look and see what you think. For me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/ebbw-vale-55151&quot;&gt;the painting of Ebbw Vale&lt;/a&gt; was probably my favourite of the whole show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad I went and I think that if you like Lowry’s work or are interested in the social history of the UK between 1920 and 1950, you will get a lot out of it. I’d recommend that you try to go when it is not busy but it is a very popular show, so that might not be possible! Be prepared to revisit some of the busier rooms as you might get elbowed out of the way by the audio guide crowd at some points!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Reset Button</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-reset-button"/>
   <updated>2013-10-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-reset-button</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;previously-on&quot;&gt;Previously on…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned this post as a follow-up to one called &lt;a href=&quot;/the-truth-about-work/&quot;&gt;The Truth About Work&lt;/a&gt; from a couple of months ago, but a few things happened that changed my thinking. It has implications for my future and in particular, it redefines what this break from work and upcoming trip means to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the punchlines to “The Truth About Work” was that, sometimes, the only way to move ahead is to quit. I originally put it a little more baldly: I said that you &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have to quit in order to move on from a sticky situation. Because I knew I was about to quit, I felt I had to write about that decision in unequivocal terms. Obviously I don’t think that you should just tap out every single time that things get a little tough. I am not even sure now whether I should have done it at all: hitting the reset button so far in advance of the tour no longer feels like the great idea that it once did. I wasted a lot of the last six weeks and the principal effect of that has been to erode my self-esteem and my bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I’ve become difficult to live with. Leaving work is isolating in a social sense, especially because I worked with a great bunch of people and built up the majority of my social network in London around being good friends with people at work while rarely going to their parties. As you can imagine, the lack of human contact and stimulating work throughout the day, along with my procrastination over the few things I had to do to prepare for the tour, mean that I have festered somewhat. It turns out that my job was doing some good for my sanity after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I realised that I was looking at things all wrong and that you can’t be “achieving” anything in particular at any given moment. Achievements are what come to us after time, the things that we look back on and laugh about, or cringe at, or make toasts to. You attain very little in life if you are goal focussed - or at least if you are goals were like mine: abstract, open-ended and unachievable. When you say things to yourself like “I will learn X” or “I will get better at Y”, you have to be very careful that you aren’t sweet talking abuse toward yourself. To get things done and feel good, you have to make those goals specific and achievable. You can say “I will read &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; book (before all the others)” or “I will run 4km in 25 minutes”. A deadline never goes amiss either, the reason why you hate them at work is because they actually make you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After realising what a hole I had got into, I tried to make more of these precise goals and I think it is working for me. Generally I try to do one thing each day and then see how I feel after that. I made a cake the other day and that was a real confidence booster. (Spoiler alert: a post entitled “The Only Chocolate Cake Recipe You’ll Ever Need” is coming soon!) I also fixed up this blog to looking pretty: that was a longer goal as editing 400+ blog posts can feel like an unending task when you are setting out, though it became easier as soon as I made a list of the posts I would fix in a given session and checked them off one by one. This meant that my sessions didn’t take too long and when I looked at the results of each session’s work, I felt a pride in what I had done and was excited for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reset-button&quot;&gt;The Reset Button&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said I still feel lacking in character for allowing myself to get into this funk in the first place and so, rather than hazy headline goals for my life, I decided that I need some guidelines for how to proceed. With Buddhism as my template, I wrote these four little lines in my notepad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behave better&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be nicer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expect less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent days I revisited each of these guidelines and tried to work out they really mean to me and what I could do in my life to espouse them. For starters, on closer analysis aren’t 1 and 2 sort of the same thing? I think so, but I choose to take them as respectively representing inward and outward behaviour. Kindness has to be self-directed as well as other-directed and I think it is important to address both of these when you’re trying to improve yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to write a post on each of these four before I leave for South America. I realise that this journey is a massive chance to push the reset button on my life in a gentle and fun way. It will be nice to get up and go from A to B for the day, to be present in my life and see, hear, taste, smell, and feel new things. It is my hope that if I can do that for six months, I can carry on doing that for a long time afterward. I don’t want to be a completely different person and I don’t expect to become one, I am just really excited at the thought of making the most of who I can be from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Art Under Attack at Tate Britain</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/art-under-attack-at-tate-britain"/>
   <updated>2013-10-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/art-under-attack-at-tate-britain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I went with a friend to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/art-under-attack-histories-british-iconoclasm&quot;&gt;Tate Britain’s “Art Under Attack” show&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an interesting, if uneven, affair that entertains but doesn’t quite succeed in everything it attempts to do. The big word that you learn is iconoclasm: the act of attacking an object believed to represent particular beliefs. The show splits into two parts: ideological acts of iconoclasm committed against works of art in Britain and the work of British artists who embrace iconoclasm as a means for making art. The first half (comprising more than half of the show - because I lump together two of the shows sections “Religion” and “Politics” into this half) is more interesting and successful than the second (“Aesthetics”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why has Tate Britain created an exhibition about iconoclasm in Britain? It might have something to do with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/9592962/Rothko-painting-vandalised-in-Tate-Modern.html&quot;&gt;an incident last year at Tate Modern in which one of the wonderful Rothko Red paintings was “vandalised”&lt;/a&gt; in the name of some dubious art movement or other (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisisyellowism.com&quot;&gt;“yellowism” apparently&lt;/a&gt;). Sadly that Rothko is not on display in the show and the incident was not mentioned at all, which seems like a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The religious section of the show was captivating, showing just how much fine art and cultural heritage the reformation destroyed. The remains on display are heartbreaking, mere fragments of beautiful sculptures, paintings, and stained glass windows, alongside erasures and excisions from fine illuminated manuscripts. The exhibition takes great pains to explain that this process did not just take place at the orders of Henry VIII, but also later on under Edward IV and under the puritans during the interregnum. The ideology of the reformation held that lavish representations of religious imagery were a form of idolatry, the worship of graven images and such like forbidden by the second commandment. The show displays some of the works of art that replaced the destroyed images, large bodies of text devoted to the scripture that was held to be the true representation of the Christian faith. To this day, these events have ground into us a love of textual messages - witness the “Keep Calm and Carry On” posters that you see everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political section of the show is mostly concerned with objects at two ends of the scale size-wise: statues and coins. Generally political acts of iconoclasm have involved the Irish blowing up statues of William III, but also Americans destroying another statue of poor William III, and the rowdy folk of Leicester Square dressing a statue of George III in a dunce’s cap and painting his horse white with black polka dots. A replica of a statue of James II dragged into the Tyne by supporters of William III is also on display, which just goes to show that you can be both a winner and a loser in the iconoclasm game. The coins show some lovely works of defacement, complete with some shockingly seditious statements: “Down With Prince Albert”, “Queen Victoria likes a shag”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second room celebrating political acts of iconoclasm is devoted to the suffragette movement, who would often go into galleries and deface artworks in the name of securing votes for women. The works attacked are on display, with very little damage to be seen. Thankfully the suffragettes achieved their aims as the attacks against these works of art are now invisible (at least to my weary eyes), therefore erasing the statements they tried to make with their acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the suffragette room, the show falls off a bit. The works of modern art attacked in Tate galleries are not particularly interesting and though mention is made in the supporting texts about criticism of art in the media inspiring acts of iconoclasm, there is little of this on show. Perhaps it lacks an explicit Tate connection, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Foundation_art_award&quot;&gt;but what about the K Foundation awarding the prize for “worst artist” to Rachel Whiteread shortly after she won the Turner Prize?&lt;/a&gt; Isn’t that an iconoclasm of sorts? And did they have to only consider incidents in the Tate galleries? Anyway, I think the whole show loses its nerve a bit once it hits the twentieth century, but I’m willing to go back and give it another go (if I can find the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’d recommend the earlier bits of the show as the religious pieces are worth seeing (some are on display for the first time) and the history is something that we in England need to come to terms with. It was different enough from an ordinary exhibition centred on one artist and if there are too many people seeing Lowry (believe me, there will be!) then this will make for an enjoyable alternative. I saw the Lowry show today as well and will write a post about that later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. G. Ballard, High-Rise</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/high-rise"/>
   <updated>2013-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/high-rise</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a few false starts I managed to finish “High-Rise”, the next in &lt;a href=&quot;j-g-ballard&quot;&gt;my collection of JG Ballard novels&lt;/a&gt;. For a book that I had trouble getting into, it turned out to be a pretty good read - even if it was also a pretty unpleasant one. Published in 1975, “High-Rise” is perhaps ahead of its time in exploring the effects of social breakdown in stylised and artificial situations where people are in close contact. You might think the plot, about a luxury high-rise that goes to hell, is in some way political or sociological but it really isn’t. It’s just a big playground in which Ballard throws around some of his most twisted ideas, all the while remarking on the very artifice of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly forty years on, Ballard has not succeeded in producing a vision of how we live now but rather how we are entertained. “High-Rise” summons no chill about modern life but rather one about the vapidity and viciousness of so-called reality TV and the cult of the minor celebrity. This novel is the ultimate tale of the reality TV pressure cooker setup left to simmer and explode in spectacular fashion. Here “reality” is only as real as the one on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel also bites hard at the consumerist society that has continued to build since it was written:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The building was a monument to good taste, to the well-designed kitchen, to sophisticated utensils and fabrics, to elegant and never ostentatious furnishings – in short, to that whole aesthetic sensibility which these well educated professional people had inherited from all the schools of industrial design, all the award-winning schemes of interior decoration institutionalised by the last quarter of the 20th century… In a sense, these people were the vanguard of a well-to-do and well-educated proletariat of the future, boxed up in these expensive apartments with their elegant furniture and intelligent sensibilities, and no possibility of escape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet, it is the Ballard novel that I have enjoyed the most. I don’t know if it is because I have adjusted to his style or if it’s one of his best books (we’ll see). It might even be that I have more knowledge now of what it is like to live in a block of flats than I did when I first attempted to read this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say it has the best opening lines of all his novels so far, better than most novels in fact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Later, as he sat on the balcony eating the dog, Dr Robert Laing reflected on the unusual events that had taken place within this huge apartment building during the previous three months. Now that everything had returned to normal, he was surprised that there had been no obvious beginning, no point beyond which their lives had moved into a clearly more sinister dimension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the appearance of the phrases “eating the dog” and “everything had returned to normal” in consecutive sentences. Ballard does a neat trick of giving you the end of the story in the first chapter and then flashing back through the rest - a relatively straightforward version of a trick that he’ll use again more showily in his next novel “The Unlimited Dream Company” - which helps set you up for the end of the story to just be “this is where we came in”. More on that in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that by this point – into his stride on a hot streak of novels – Ballard had worked out the perversities of his readership and part of the reason why “High-Rise” is such a good read is because it is basically a game of chicken between reader and author. The main question is “how dark can you handle?” Acts of violence are described methodically and without sensation, with little thought and explanation of motive given. As with all violence, the dissection of its motive is a luxury afforded only to those at a remove from its effects – in this case the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How dark does it get? Very, though Ballard often draws a discreet curtain over the worst if it. The terrible fate of the swimming pool, the sculpture garden covered in blood, the “game” of Flight School conducted on the balcony of the fortieth floor: all of these are discussed with enough detail to chill, without lingering long enough to deaden the impact. The result is a mad descent into darkness (in clever contrast to the characters’ compulsion to ascend toward the top of the high-rise) that is both moral and physical in nature, a bizarre menagerie of characters who take to their latent barbarism with all too much ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you read on, covering your eyes at points, it becomes clear that Ballard is relishing this tale. In some sense it is a retread of the same themes as &lt;a href=&quot;crash&quot;&gt;“Crash”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;concrete-island&quot;&gt;“Concrete Island”&lt;/a&gt;, that the mask of civilisation that we all wear is rather fragile and will drop from our faces with the merest nudge, and so perhaps this time around Ballard is grandstanding like the raconteur at the bar, giving his story some real welly. There are lots of little nuggets of language, far too many for me to keep a track of them all. The one that stuck in my mind (because it is near the end) was “her tired eyes drifted about in her head like lost fish” - the perfect image of someone driven to complete distraction by stress and lack of sleep. I underlined so many passages as I went through that at one point I thought this post might just be a list of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with two passages as a way of summing up. The first is about how the building’s architect Anthony Royal imagines the high-rise is seen by the outside world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Far below him, a car drove along the access road to the nearby high-rise, it’s three occupants looking up at the hundreds of crowded balconies. Anyone seeing this ship of lights would take for granted that the two thousand people on board lived together in a state of corporate euphoria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by the end of the novel it is revealed that the psychosis of its inhabitants is in fact a contagion (or a simple act of human nature):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Laing looked out of the high-rise 400 yards away. A temporary power failure had occurred, and on the seventh floor all the lights were out. Already torch-beams were moving about in the darkness, as the residents made their first confused attempts to discover where they were. Laing watch them contentedly, ready to welcome them to their new world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because it is (potentially) all starting over again, this is where we came in…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, it’s the madness of birds as Shepperton becomes a utopian sex aviary (yes, really!) in “The Unlimited Dream Company”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, September 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-09-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A nice diverse selection of albums this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arctic Monkeys “AM”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BT “A Song Across Wires”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goldfrapp “Tales of Us”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Janelle Monáe “Electric Lady”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arctic-monkeys-am&quot;&gt;Arctic Monkeys “AM”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole review is basically me catching up with the rest of the world and realising that the Arctic Monkeys are ace. To be fair, I did notice how awesome they were at the opening ceremony of the Olympics last year, and I have liked the odd one or two of their singles, but up until now I haven’t really wanted to listen to any of their albums. In fact before “AM”, I already had two (ripped from the CDs of friends) but had never bothered to listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympics aside, their performance at Glastonbury earlier this year was what made me decide to investigate “AM”. It was rightly given a nice big slot on the BBC iPlayer and I spent an enjoyable morning in my bedroom dancing to it. Because I don’t know many of their songs, I didn’t know at the time that their set included a number of the new songs (of course it would, it’s totally logical in hindsight!) but after watching it I was determined to investigate the new album when it emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s brilliant. It ticks pretty much all my boxes for what a good album should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Short. It’s 42 minutes long.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has songs that work well as stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no real need for me to go through song by song and say what they’re about, a couple of my favourites should suffice. I will mention that there is, unfortunately, one duffer: “Mad Sounds”. It has lyrics like a Britpop B-side and sounds like a filler song from a U2 album (and not one of the good ones). Even then it’s not completely awful but I do skip it more often than not (plus side: the album’s even shorter!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So faves then: “Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?”, mainly for the title but also for the backing which actually manages to make good on the comments they’ve made in interviews about making songs that sound like 50 Cent and Dr. Dre; “Arabella”, probably the most exuberant song I have heard all year and the way that such cool ideas are hung across lyrics that are pretty much tongue-twisters is quite satisfactory; “Knee Socks” - Martin Buber says that “an anecdote is the recital of an incident that illuminates an entire destiny” and it was never more true than with this song; and finally “I Wanna Be Yours” as it manages to be super cute and laugh out loud funny at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should really go through and pick out some of the really funny and really clever lyrics but if I did that I would be here all day! Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bt-a-song-across-wires&quot;&gt;BT “A Song Across Wires”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new album from BT follows the now established pattern for his releases: a slow almost ambient album followed by a more song-based album, so following &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-july-2012&quot;&gt;last year’s woozy “If The Stars Are Eternal So Are You and I”&lt;/a&gt; we have the collaboration and song filled “A Song Across Wires”. Like the last BT album with songs “These Hopeful Machines” it’s being released in multiple versions at once: on the double CD release, one CD of short versions of the tracks and a second CD with the album’s tracks mixed into one continuous track using the longer versions of the songs. Both these versions are also on Spotify and the short version of the album on iTunes includes the continuous mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’m nothing if not a stickler for trying to get hold of everything (viz &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2012&quot;&gt;the Ricardo Villalobos album last year&lt;/a&gt;) and so I went for the full length versions, which are (currently) only available from Beatport. It’s annoying to have to sign up for yet another site but in fairness the album in one download was cheaper than the short versions from iTunes. Unfortunately, getting hold of the longer versions is a necessity. While the songs on “These Hopeful Machines” (released as “These Humble Machines”) worked really well as five or six-minute pieces, the short versions of the songs on “A Song Across Wires” are almost like jingles reduced to little over three minutes. In some cases the full song seems to have completely different personality to the edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point I will only discuss the long versions. As usual there are a few instrumental tracks and the best of these is “Skylarking”, which opens the album. It’s a beautiful lilting trance tune that’s probably the first he’s written in quite a while that bears comparison with career highlights like “Flaming June”. The other two “Tomahawk” (an old tune that’s been around for ages now, it is the track that probably benefits the most from hearing the long version) and “Vervoeren” are less successful to my ears, and none of the three quite have the wonderful bone-juddering qualities of THM highlight “Nocturne et Lumiere”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can split the songs between those with actual lyrics, like “Stem The Tides” and “Surrounded”, and those that tend to use vocals as additional wallpaper, like “Letting Go” (Key lyrics: “Letting go/letting go/letting go go go”) and “Calling Your Name”. Obviously the former are slightly more satisfying, especially “Stem The Tides” and the closer “Lifeline”. Meanwhile I also really like “City Life” though the lyrics are in Korean so I can’t understand them; I’m cool with that and I think this is the first bit of K-Pop to make it into my music collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A Song Across Wires” is pretty good, though if pushed I’d prefer “These Hopeful Machines” or the UK version of “Movement In Still Life”. I guess I’m old school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goldfrapp-tales-of-us&quot;&gt;Goldfrapp “Tales of Us”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of any other band that does what Goldfrapp does so well and that is to switch between two poles with each album, so every album feels different but when you compare that album to others like it they sound like gentle iterations on one another. In one cluster you have “Black Cherry”, “Supernature” and 2010’s “Head First”: generally upbeat sexy party music; and in the other cluster you have début album “Felt Mountain”, “The Seventh Tree” and now “Tales of Us”. Last year’s singles collection was also surprisingly cohesive. Tellingly, the new songs on that release would work pretty well on “Tales Of Us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing about Goldfrapp that is said less often (and this may be because it is my opinion and not so much an empirical fact) is how much Alison Goldfrapp’s voice has improved with time. She has always had a really good way with a tune, which is why she is on so many great albums that I loved in my teens (highlights are her contributions to Tricky’s “Pumpkin” off “Maxinequaye” and to “Sad But True” off Orbital’s “Snivilisation”) but here her voice just sounds gorgeous. It helps that the backing this time around is very stripped back and bare, save for the sweeps of strings, and if this is making you think of “Felt Mountain”, you’d be right. It could almost be “Return To Felt Mountain: Even Feltier” but this time around there are real songs with proper lyrics that you can make out and everything. No guff about fascist babies this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there’s no “Oompa Radar” either, and everything is played very straight. Apart from the string arrangements, there’s almost no instrumental clutter: no beats, no wubs, not even so much as a funky synth wash. The focus is entirely on the songs. In some places it’s over earnest like a comedian playing a serious role, but in the main it’s very satisfying and pretty. It’s not compelling all the way through, when I listen in the daytime my mind does wander in the middle before the final brace of songs pulls me back, and if I listen to it at night I fall asleep. (Recall that I have said many times in my reviews that an album that consistently sends you to sleep is a very useful to have.) Nevertheless the first five songs and the last two definitely suggest that there is plenty of life in Goldfrapp yet. If they stick to type, the next one will be all glitter and disco balls and white horses, but maybe they won’t, maybe they will succumb to senescence and if “Tales of Us” proves anything, it’s that there will be no nicer place for Goldfrapp to graze out their dotage than on the foothills of Felt mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;janelle-monáe-electric-lady&quot;&gt;Janelle Monáe “Electric Lady”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every month I give something different a try and sometimes I get a nice surprise. This month it was Janelle Monáe’s “Electric Lady”. I first encountered her on “Stargate Universe” and thought at the time that her record company must have had high expectations for her to shoehorn her into the show the way they did (and here we are, she’s outlived that series many-to-one). Apparently, this album is part of a sequence with an overarching story about sentient robots etc but apart from the skits it doesn’t seem to intrude into the music that much. It is great to see science fiction themes in (relatively) mainstream music though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a perfect album (it has skits for a start, even if they are pretty funny) because it is a bit too long and could do with being a bit more focussed in places - it gets a bit baggy toward the end. However the good definitely outweighs the bad and there are some great pop songs here, especially if you happen to like your pop songs with an R&amp;amp;B sheen. “Dance Apocalyptic” is one of the best pop songs in ages, I liked the sappy duet “Prime Time” with Miguel more than I thought I would (is it me or is he on everyone’s records at the moment?) and “What An Experience” is a fine song to end the album on (and perhaps the only song that I would have liked to have been a little longer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I will check out her other albums on Spotify before I have to suspend my subscription while I am away. I will certainly miss the chance to take a random punt on albums each month because nice surprises like this make it all so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-month&quot;&gt;Next month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHVRCHES album, which I have already been playing the hell out of, the HAIM album (to keep up the run of all capitals band names), and something else that I haven’t decided on yet. And maybe Disclosure’s “Settle” because I’m supposed to have written about that ages ago…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #25: Long Gone Before Daylight by The Cardigans</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-25"/>
   <updated>2013-09-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-25</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The single biggest fact of life is that you are always going to be alone, you just might not realise it. Listening to The Cardigans’ excellent 2003 “Long Gone Before Daylight” will help you see that all our relationships are essentially screwed – but at least it sounds great while it does so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Long Gone Before Daylight” (“Long Gone Before Daylight”) plays the role of “The Empire Strikes Back” in a trilogy of great albums that The Cardigans released between 1999 (the arguably better and slightly happier “Gran Turismo”) and 2006 (the unarguably inferior and definitely happier “Super Extra Gravity”). “Long Gone Before Daylight” has more of a country sound than “Gran Turismo” or “Super Extra Gravity”, which meant that I ignored it for a long time: until the disintegration and failure of several relationships convinced me of its brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the opening track “Communication” which is, of course, about the total impossibility of communicating with someone that you’ve broken up with. After a break-up the thing that always kills you is the way you revisit your golden memories and try to work out how you could have done things differently. How could you have explained yourself in some better way? It’s all there in the devastating lyrics that end the song:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And I hold / A record for being patient / With your kind of hesitation / I need you, you want me / But I don’t know / How to connect / So I disconnect”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I’m making this record sound like a massive downer. It really isn’t. This album is great help for getting over things and to get over things, you need to understand yourself and the fact that the pain of failure helps you grow. Both of the next two songs “You’re The Storm” and “A Good Horse” are about the perils of love, but they are quite jaunty: the former has stuff to say about how it’s the risk of love that makes you feel good (“I need some wind to get me sailing / so it’s the storm that I believe in”) and the latter is a cheerful dedication to rebound sex (“Now I’m trying out another heart / I’ve been whining about a fresh start / I’ve found myself a good horse”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece of “Long Gone Before Daylight” is “And Then You Kissed Me”, a long gruelling song that equates love with physical violence in an eerie detached fashion as the narrator spars with the lover who gives them “a halo around my eye” when she “pushed you a little a bit more”. It takes a few listens to really get into it, but then this is the band who produced gruesome videos of their lead singer being decapitated in an car accident (“My Favourite Game”) and of themselves getting squished while performing in a room with ever closing walls (“Erase/Rewind”), it’s dark but it’s a part of their character. Nevertheless, it’s telling that they revisited this song again on “Super Extra Gravity” (“And Then You Kissed Me II”) and barely toned it down at all. I guess it fits in with the long tradition of country music expresses dark emotions in its lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Man, you hit me!&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, you hit me really hard&lt;br /&gt;
Baby you hit me!&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, you punched me right in the heart&lt;br /&gt;
And then you kissed me…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you could argue that the next song “Couldn’t Care Less” is crueller, if you happen to believe that indifference can hurt as much physical violence. The whole of this song is about how you can both be there in a relationship, aware of everything that’s wrong, and yet do nothing about fixing it. So the songs on “Long Gone Before Daylight” just pile on all these reflections and reiterations of how things go wrong in love, and at this point they lay on a beautiful ninety second instrumental coda - presumably in case it’s all getting too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless by the end of the first verse of “Please Sister” they’ve already said that “you should know that love will never die / but see how it kills you in the blink of an eye” - the whole song is a plea for love even in the knowledge that it hurts you, the phrasing is intentionally along the lines of love as a fix. On this song, which is actually quite poppy and could have been a monster hit if produced with the same punch and sheen of the singles from “Gran Turismo”, the production is quite flat: every thing that should soar instead feels tinny and plastic (the same thing affects “A Good Horse” too). I think this is intentional and consistent with the depressed and defeated tone of the whole album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For What It’s Worth” is a little perkier, a pean to the joys of falling in love with someone you’re meant to be “just friends” with. I love how Nina’s voice really strains with the pain of having to sing “For what it’s worth, I love you” only to follow it up with “And what is worse, I really do”, the lyrics are great but the way she sings it really sums up the shittiest of shit relationship situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some salvation on “Lead Me Into The Night”, a gentle torch song about finding escape from the pains of love in the arms of another (a more mature take on the sentiments of “A Good Horse”). Interestingly, the bridge of this song (“Oh you, you, you, it’s gotta be you”) is incorporated into “And Then You Kissed Me II” on “Super Extra Gravity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Live and Learn” sounds uncannily like a Sheryl Crow song (for me, that’s a good thing, her eponymous second album will be one that I will write when this series resumes next June) and it basically plays out the message of its title. The last two songs “Feathers and Down” and “03.45: No Sleep” round things off on a gentler sleepier note. “Feathers and Down” is about wishing you could help a friend who is hurting (arguably a change in viewpoint to the rest of the album), it has a really nice arrangement that seems lighter and more lively than most of the rest of the album. Again though it’s about solace in sex, but it doesn’t play its hand until the last line “come baby, let’s drown / in feathers and down”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m waking with the roaches&lt;br /&gt;
The world has surrendered&lt;br /&gt;
I’m dating ancient ghosts&lt;br /&gt;
(The ones I made friends with)&lt;br /&gt;
The comfort of fireflies&lt;br /&gt;
Long gone before daylight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final song “03.45: No Sleep” plays out simply and sparsely with its graceful lyrics about being up at night and not wanting the rest of the world to wake up and find you. As a dyed in the wool insomniac, I’ve felt this sensation many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it “Long Gone Before Daylight”: it’s not quite the total bummer that I’ve made it out to be. If you’re still smarting from a horrible incident in your love life, it might provide a bittersweet salve (though I’d try something much happier if you’re having a really tough time of it). My version has two bonus tracks, the second “If There Is A Chance” is a lot happier and sweeter than what comes before so that will cheer you up I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the last understated classic for quite a while. I’ll resume again with number 26 in June next year.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ellen Gallagher at Tate Modern</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/ellen-gallagher-at-tate-modern"/>
   <updated>2013-09-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ellen-gallagher-at-tate-modern</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ellen Gallagher is an American artist and her “AxME” show recently finished at the Tate Modern. I went along a few weeks ago and have only now had a bit of time to write up my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest regret is that I didn’t go along to it sooner, so that I had a chance to see it more than once. It was certainly a larger show than I was expecting (it was about the size of the &lt;a href=&quot;ibrahim-el-salahi-at-tate-modern&quot;&gt;Ibrahim El-salahi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;choucair-at-tate-modern&quot;&gt;Saloua Choucair&lt;/a&gt; shows put together) and I hadn’t left myself with a lot of time to see everything when I did go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also a lot better than I was expecting. Gallagher’s work is funny and provocative, it was certainly nice to go and see modern art that made you chuckle. Generally her pieces are about race, identity, and the appropriation of found materials to produce a new context or meaning for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outstanding pieces (“Double Natural” (2002) and “Afrylic” (2004) dominated the second room) are without doubt the large pieces comprised of small multiples based on adverts from 1950s women’s magazines. The men and women beaming out of these ads for hair and beauty products are subverted with large pieces of yellow acrylic and googly eyes, turning them into surreal and comic figures. I assume the intention is to satirise the idea of transforming one’s body in the fashion described in the adverts. The repetition of small multiples no doubt representing the mass production of the advertised products, but also to show how a collective obsession, no matter how surreal, lends those engaged in it the very conformity that they seek to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere there were beautiful see-through watercolours painted on transparent paper (like “Morphia” (2008-12)) and mounted on see through panes so that you could see them from both sides, the point being that the images changes when viewed from the other side. These were quite magical in fact, and a large part of the pleasure of viewing them was to ponder upon just how they were constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction seems to play a large role in Gallagher’s work, or at least those selected for this show. Almost every piece contained not only some overall image but also some riff on how it was made. Typical of this were the shiny black pieces like “Mobb Deep” (1998): at face value you are presented with a canvas that has been painted but then you notice the presence of another work beneath the slick black façade, the presence of the same collage of rubber and paper pieces that make up her other works. In some ways, this is a run-on from the two-sided watercolours, except instead of admiring two views of the same thing that Gallagher has given you, you are trying to bring that second view of the same artwork out of the pitch by black yourself. (In the catalogue for the show these works are reproduced in a way that you can see all the structure quite easily, something that is more difficult in the gallery itself.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/MobbDeep.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved “Bird In Hand” (2006) but what you can’t really see in my terrible stealth picture of it is its wonderful texture. It’s made from hundreds of paper cutouts and up close it’s really beautiful and intricate. The central character is a Cape Verdian pirate and the whole piece is about of the effect of the slave trade in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/BirdInHand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite piece was “An Experiment of Unusual Opportunity” (2008), a collage of coloured paper partly washed over with indian ink. It’s a dark piece but not quite as austere as the black ones, the red at the centre really pops out and the whole thing twists in and around itself, like a figure caught in dark waves. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment&quot;&gt;The title refers to a notorious experiment conducted in the US between 1932 and 1972&lt;/a&gt; in which black men with Syphilis were observed rather than treated. A similar piece called “Puppy Chow” (2009) also combines dark inks and paper strips to produce something that looks like a painting but isn’t, something tactile and textural that you want to reach out and touch (but you can’t because unfortunately it’s displayed under glass).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/PuppyChow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to be in the right mood for multimedia installations but “Osedax” (2010) was amazing, the perfect blend of a carved wooden box to sit in, the videos, the projections and the music (and the vibrations from the speakers under the wooden benches). It’s ostensibly about dead whales that wash ashore to be consumed by scavengers (according to the show guide) but it seems too pretty for that. I tried to film what it was like inside but the resulting 15 second snippet didn’t do it any justice at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rather rushed the final rooms, which were given over to a series called “Watery Ecstatic” and is based on marine biological themes and no small amount of Moby Dick. These pieces were largely white and green, the paintings were a picture of watercolours and etchings made in to the paper itself (so rather than adding strips and layers of paper, the paper is etched into, removed, or distressed to create shapes and textures). Dominating this room was a sculpture called “Preserve” (2001) that I will admit I found baffling; it was like a white climbing frame but embossed over it were motifs similar to those found in the Watery Ecstatic paintings, almost as though the paper layering technique had escaped into the world of metal work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way that I have done justice to this wonderful show and I hope that it pops up somewhere else soon. I will remember Ellen Gallagher as an artist that I really like and I look forward to seeing more of her work in the future. The hero image is “Double Natural” (2004).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, August 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For reasons that will become apparent, there will be a short period soon where I will not be writing album digests. Until then, I’m clearing a backlog of some albums that I’ve been listening to but haven’t had enough time or motivation to write about. Only one of this month’s albums was released this month, something that’s not that uncommon at this time of the year as it is not the best time to release things. Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Washed Out “Paracosm”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bonobo “The North Borders”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Atoms For Peace “AMOK”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;washed-out-paracosm&quot;&gt;Washed Out “Paracosm”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to like this so much more. I am certainly very happy with it, but after a while I had to work out why I was hardly bothering to listen to it. I’ve decided that I don’t think it is better (as a whole) than his first album “Within and Without”. It starts really well: the opening swirls of ambient noise and a big knowing wink of a harp sample lead into the wonderful single “It All Feels Right”. At this point it feels like the smooch-fest of “Within and Without” has, with a red face and sweaty sex hair, made it back to the party with the aim of sipping mojitos in the garden. It’s really pretty and fun and good natured: for me “It All Feels Right” has been one of the songs of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This momentum gets backed up by another great song “Don’t Give Up”: it’s all sweet vocals and interesting low end before a pretty strong chorus kicks in (for a Washed Out record). After that song though, the album becomes a bit anonymous and the samples of party noise that are woven between the songs, which must have sounded like a good idea at the time, just come across as a bit annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with a record about having a good time is that it has to make you feel like you are having a good time too, or you’re not really going to like it or remember it. “Within and Without” was great because even thought it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; as if two people were getting their freak on in the room with you, it at least felt like a threesome: most of “Paracosm” feels more like gatecrashing a couple’s date and having to listen to them tell anecdotes about a holiday they went on which was way better than yours. By the end of “Weightless” (the third proper song!) you start to wonder if they even need you there at all…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a complete wash out though (see what I did there?!?!?): “All I Know” turns the dial labelled “pop mode” all the way to the right and is pretty fun (check out the amazing instrumental middle 8!), and “Falling Back” is pretty sweet: the backing has a cool twitchiness to it, although I’m still in two minds about the hipster-ish clapping and party whoops at the end. It also has an absolutely beautiful coda that makes up for that, it’s all swooning twinkles that make you think that the last track has already started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closing track “All Over Now” leads out of that wonderful coda to “All I Know” and doesn’t squander it, instead playing out the album with the track that’s probably closest to “Within and Without” in spirit. I feel a bit bad about feeling good about how the new album finishes sounding closer to the first one, it doesn’t feel like I am being an open minded music fan to be pleased by a retrograde step like that. Nevertheless, “Paracosm” is a mixed bag and, to my ears, a little bit of a backward step. However, the (very) good bits are good enough make me think that it will be worth checking out whatever he might do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonobo-the-north-borders&quot;&gt;Bonobo “The North Borders”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album is great. It is the first album that I have come across by Bonobo. Apparently his previous album “Black Sands” is even better; I have listened to it a couple of times but not enough to make a decent comparison. “The North Borders” was released a while ago but for some reason it did not appear on Spotify. I think a couple of singles were released to Spotify, which is why I knew the album was worth chasing. Either that or I’d heard a few samples on iTunes. This month I finally managed to get a listen to it on Spotify and slowly fell in love with it. It’s an album as suited to the bleary-eyed walk to work as it is to meandering through some debugging as it is to switching off the light and drifting away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might predict, “The North Borders” is pretty mellow. From the outset you get music that is by turns soulful (opener “First Fires”), laid-back (follow-on “Emkay” with its layers of vocal samples), and mysterious (third track “Cirrus”). However, there is all kind of satisfying detail and structure too: these tracks reward active listening as much as they do passive sessions where you put the headphones on and do something else. “Cirrus” for instance has these lovely layers of drones and bass lines that fold in and out of the mix, above and beneath one another, underpinned by some interesting synth chimes and insistent drum patters. In the grand scheme of the entirety of “The North Borders”, “Cirrus” seems at first listen to just be there to connect track two to track four, and yet on repeat listens it’s very rewarding and is it’s own internally consistent sound world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if Bonobo mis-steps at all throughout it’s in attempting to plant that hoary staple of dance albums – the “proper song” – throughout the track listing. For example, Erykah Badu collab “Heaven For The Sinner” seems to be both a misuse of her talents and his as it isn’t a particularly brilliant song (as songs go) and as a track it only really gets fun once it opens up in the last minute and starts to sample itself, falling down and repeating snippets of the vocal line over the collapsing music box backing. By contrast “Sapphire”, which follows next, is an almost entirely instrumental track and quickly sets to work at being a pretty groove-laden track that goes some way to disproving any initial hunch that “The North Borders” might prove to be an inert album that’s slightly too chilled out. The vocal samples and the bass line are busy and intricate, as well as beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that the formula is established and it just gets mucked about with for the remainder of the album. “Jets” has a tasteful jazzy tinge like something Roni Size might have done in this genre (there’s also a really satisfying grind of a bass line at points), “Towers” steps into trip-hop territory to make 1999 sound even better than you remember it (this is the way to do vocal tracks on albums like these: keep it simple, sweet, and short), while “Don’t Wait” and “Know You” both split the difference between Burial and Four Tet with processed vocals and confident arrangements. The feel here is very much sun-dappled forest glades, which is admittedly rather different to the actual collaboration between Burial and Four Tet (it was all glowering shades and moodiness in case you were asking: do check it out if you haven’t already, it’s brilliant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this track-by-track description of “The North Borders” makes it sound like it starts to tail off and repeat itself, maybe it does do that a little but I don’t think that it’s to the detriment of the album as a whole. If you read a few of my reviews of albums, you’ll notice that I favour albums that are a consistent experience and are interesting all the way through (see the Washed Out review above for what I think when this fails). I think that “The North Borders” is both of these and even though I thought it sounded a little samey at first, it’s grown on me a lot as I listened to it more (much more). If you like Burial and Four Tet, I think you will find it a treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;atoms-for-peace-amok&quot;&gt;Atoms For Peace “AMOK”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atoms For Peace is a supergroup formed by Thom Yorke, ostensibly to perform songs from his (very good) solo album “The Earaser” in a live setting. “AMOK” follows up “The Eraser” in a very similar vein and has been out since February. Back then I listened to it on Spotify and decided that it wasn’t worth getting a copy, well at least until Record Store Day when I saw a copy of the limited edition CD and fell in love with it as an object. Recently Thom Yorke and Nigel Godrich have been very vocal about withdrawing their music from Spotify because of the poor royalties that the service offers to new artists. I guess the fact that I bought a physical copy because the actual thing was remarkably pretty is part of another argument entirely but these reviews are largely underpinned by finding stuff I like on Spotify so that I can write enthusiastically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musically, I have already summed up “AMOK” as “more of the same” but on a closer listen you can hear that it is slightly looser and more relaxed because it is based on jams by a live band. I find it hard to believe that all of it is performed live (but apparently it is) but I certainly believe that a lot of it is. Some of the “Amnesiac” era Radiohead B-sides (like “Kinetic” and “The Amazing Sounds Of Orgy”) are very much the sound of a band trying to replicate live the sound of an electronic act. In fact, that’s been the main source of much of Radiohead’s success between 1997’s “OK Computer” and today. Here, there’s a more overt attempt to precisely replicate the clicks and samples of modern music and to incorporate them into interesting songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas “The Eraser” mostly hectored about climate change and the Iraq war, “AMOK” (despite its title) seems to be a mellower and happier record. There’s a certain dark edge to tracks like “Before My Very Eyes” and “Unless” but the songs seem to be mostly focussed on the idea that you catch more flies with honey. Just as “King Of Limbs” features a lot of straight out sweet love songs, “AMOK” is stacked with interesting arrangements and songs you can croon along to. While it is probably a good thing that someone tried to write a sensible pop song about the death of weapons inspector Dr. David Kelly, it’s not going to be something you can comfortably enjoy while taking a long train journey (that’s ok, you are not supposed to be able to). “AMOK” is a good album and I think it’s a bit better than “The Eraser”, even if it feels a little like the sharper edges have been smoothed off of Thom’s songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s come back to that Spotify thing. I understand the point that they are making: the figures that get released by small artists about how much they get paid are shocking. What we don’t see is what the same artists might be getting from their album sales and from their gigs, but of course we are told that one of the reasons that Spotify exists is because people don’t buy albums and because it is hard for smaller bands to make a profit from their tours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple fact is that Spotify should charge its advertisers and its customers more. £10 a month to play unlimited albums is too low. Twice that would be too low to give artists the royalties they deserve. Spotify has obviously decided that the only way to persuade people (and advertisers) to sign up is to keep the prices ridiculously low but the very existence of a free tier is always going to undermine both them and the artists. It’s OK for Apple, Amazon, and Google to pay smaller amounts to artists because these are (supposed to be) plays of material that the user of the service has already (indirectly) paid the artist for, but Spotify has to face up to the reality of what the service they are offering actually means for artists. This means abolishing the free tier altogether and at least doubling the prices of its premium offering. Would I still be a user of that service? Probably not, I’d probably go back to taking a punt on three or four albums a month instead.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Truth About Work</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-truth-about-work"/>
   <updated>2013-08-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-truth-about-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation-and-lies&quot;&gt;Motivation and Lies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation is a fickle thing. You can see it in action here on this blog, or rather in inaction as there are often “&lt;a href=&quot;/articles/the-drought/&quot;&gt;droughts&lt;/a&gt;” between posts (and draughts between drafts…). Back in June I tried to write a post each day that had a title of the form “X and Y”. I was overambitious and they petered out after a bit. This was one of those posts and was originally titled “Motivation and Lies” in melodramatic fashion. I came back to the original draft this evening and quite liked it; so I rewrote the introduction, cut out some of the swears, and rounded out the conclusion a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thought about what motivates me a lot in the past few months and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scilogs.com/the_science_talent_project/can-you-increase-your-motivation-simply-by-paying-attention/&quot;&gt;I tried to pay attention to my motivation level&lt;/a&gt; as it &lt;a href=&quot;http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/wax+and+wane&quot;&gt;waxed and waned&lt;/a&gt; around my various tasks. Sometimes motivation expresses itself as that grit that drives us through a difficult series of events no matter what and sometimes it can desert us altogether despite things going great. I think I have experienced both of these lately. Sometimes it is sleep related (and here I am, late at night, typing up another blog post) so that as my fatigue increases, my motivation wanes. It’s hard to have the drive to do things when your head is swimming because you got &lt;a href=&quot;http://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need&quot;&gt;five hours sleep&lt;/a&gt; in little bursts last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the ideal approach to staying motivated is to be in a position where it isn’t an issue. This happens sometimes when I experience what is often called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-playing-field/201402/flow-states-and-creativity&quot;&gt;“flow state”&lt;/a&gt;. In this state everything just comes one after the other and very little effort is required to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5596964/how-to-rebuild-your-attention-span-and-focus&quot;&gt;maintain attention to a task&lt;/a&gt; or application to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/problem-solving.html&quot;&gt;solving a problem&lt;/a&gt;. We are not talking about inane tasks either, just ones that you end up happily doing almost automatically: you end up deep in thought yet hardly thinking. For me it often happens when I am writing or programming and sometimes when I draw or get really absorbed in music. These things, the writing and the programming at least, are things that are sometimes difficult to get started on, but once I get going I can put aside all those basic distractions – for food, sleep, pictures of cats, etc – and just get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-truth-about-work&quot;&gt;So What Is The Truth About Work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that approach to motivation, to only attempt activities that get you in to a flow state, well that is a rather &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.step.org/privileged-position&quot;&gt;privileged position&lt;/a&gt; to be in. Most of us have jobs we hate, jobs that take something that used to be fun when we were kids, that we kind of had a talent for once, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/04/i-hate-my-job-court-typist&quot;&gt;turn it into a banal hellish nightmare that we can’t escape from&lt;/a&gt;, let alone summon up a flow state for. Most of us have our flow states crushed by unthinking or inept managers, or by our own insecurity and sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor&quot;&gt;imposterhood&lt;/a&gt;: usually a little of both. So the advice “to stay motivated, get into a flow state” seems tantamount to either hippy career advice – “&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinybuddha.com/blog/15-reasons-follow-dreams-today/&quot;&gt;follow your dreams, man&lt;/a&gt;” – or to something a little more anarchic: “stay at home and paint a picture of your dog, dog”. Neither of these approaches will get you through your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metrolyrics.com/nine-to-five-lyrics-dolly-parton.html&quot;&gt;nine to five&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notice that a large number of productivity gurus are starting to fall behind the line of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenpressfield.com/do-the-work/&quot;&gt;do the work&lt;/a&gt;”. That is, if you turn up and work, you will reap the benefits of continually chipping away at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/at-the-coalface&quot;&gt;coal face&lt;/a&gt; in the long run. To me, this is crap. Why should I keep turning up to do the work if I am a) mis-used, b) under-used, c) under-valued, and d) not doing any good for the world by doing it? If you do not address your lack of motivation with any other plan than “it will get better if I keep turning up” then you are going to get done over. I know, because I have been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the truth about work is that unless you really are your own master and are doing something that you truly love, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_the_devil_and_the_deep_blue_sea&quot;&gt;you are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea&lt;/a&gt;. No one will allow you to flow and flourish, because they need you to keep turning up every day to be their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rolling+stones/beast+of+burden_20117856.html&quot;&gt;beast of burden&lt;/a&gt;. But if you just accept the drudgery of it and keep turning up in the hope of things getting better, you will never flow and you will never flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that few productivity gurus will tell you is that the solution is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/quit-before-youre-replaced-as-ceo.html&quot;&gt;quit&lt;/a&gt;. They won’t tell you that there is point where the only solution to what is bothering you is to quit because they are vested in the system that is keeping you down. But the truth about work is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_no_return&quot;&gt;beyond a certain point&lt;/a&gt; you can either quit yourself or quit your job. And you really don’t want to quit yourself right?1 You can subsume yourself and all those nagging voices, and this will get you by for a little while, but in the end if you are unhappy and unmotivated, you will have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/get_out_of_Dodge&quot;&gt;get the hell out of Dodge&lt;/a&gt;. This is what I decided to do. I will write about my experience of that in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Posters</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/posters"/>
   <updated>2013-08-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/posters</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2005, towards the end of the second year of my PhD I presented a poster at a conference in Dresden, Germany. My eccentric colleagues and I stayed on a huge canal boat moored on the Elbe for no discernible reason other than it seemed like a laugh at the time. In reality I was the second worst snorer of the three of us and it also turned out that our room was right underneath the gang-plank and every morning at six the person who made breakfast would stomp across it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was a big deal for because I, the tender footed conference virgin, was presenting a poster. That thing was difficult to make. I made it in LaTeX, an amazing mathematical typesetting language that I have neglected in the past few years. I wish I still had a copy of the PDF so I could show you the result of all that toil. I’m also glad I don’t have a copy to show you as it was full of mistakes and if you think I write terribly now, you should see how I wrote then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later I presented a poster at another conference. I was determined that the second time would be easier, so I “cheated” and used Adobe Illustrator. It handled the bulk of the heavy lifting for the layout. I used a little program I found online to take equations typeset in LaTeX and produce transparent png files. It still took ages to make, because I am a perfectionist. I really wish that I could show you that one, mistakes and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my PhD the department would scoop up all the postgraduate students and deposit us in the corporate facilities of a golf course near Bath to make us do “away day” type stuff. We’d discuss team building, career paths, how to write like every other goddamn scientist… stuff like that. One year, as someone getting close to the end of their PhD and needed to look like they’d learnt something, I was asked to give a talk on how to make posters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My talk trotted through my experiences before and at the conferences in Dresden and Tilton. I was grateful for the experience, it was the first time I felt completely in command of what I was talking about. It helps to have a story to tell and a passionate belief that the thing you are talking about should be done well. I summarised all the LaTeX code that generated the first poster and put it on my website. The PDF file about making conference posters with latex got picked up by someone at Oxford University. It was used for a while to educate some of their PhD students about how to prepare conference posters with LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that something amazing happened. I got asked to look at some posters that had been made by MSc students and first year PhD students who were studying MSc units. I’d reprised my talk for them earlier in the semester and pointed them toward my materials and my example posters. I was genuinely touched/amazed then to discover that most of the posters produced were fantastic! Someone even used LaTeX to recreate the look of the poster I had made with Illustrator. So not only did I inspire people to approach producing posters in the same way that I had, I’d also managed to make them do it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until then I’d had plenty of pleasant experiences teaching undergraduates the ins and outs of Calculus and Mechanics, but it was at that point I realised what a buzz teaching can give you. I also miss the part of myself that used to experiment with things and not be happy with it until I was right. I have lost that in the last five years and I am not entirely sure how to get it back. However, with that memory of how things used to be rattling around in my heart, you can be certain that I will try.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Despicable Me 2: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/despicable-me-2-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2013-08-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/despicable-me-2-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s so good that I paid to see it twice! There, that’s the review done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despicable Me 2&lt;/em&gt; is great for so many reasons. I reckon pretty much anyone aged from 3 to 103 would enjoy both movies’ warm heartedness and most will love the minions’ riot of anarchic slapstick. And if they don’t, I guess they aren’t our kind of people anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few good reasons for loving “Despicable Me 2” (and actually most of these reasons apply to the original “Despicable Me”):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The minions, their antics and their strange delighted helium-induced jabberings are really the heart of the movie. Their slapstick is pretty old school and the fart jokes just at that precise point where they don’t get &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;. Best of all, the minions are mostly sweet and innocent, and the represent so much the joy and exuberance of living in the moment that it’s impossible for me to watch this film and not be happy. I’m pretty sure that they will get their own movie at some point. It remains to be seen if they can carry a whole story on their own – certainly their subplot in “Despicable Me 2” is the weakest part of the film – but whatever happens, it’s sure to be 99% hilarious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even the jokes away from the minions are excellent. The best one probably involves a sushi restaurant. Not to mention the nacho hat: I’m pretty sure that they are real and someone needs to get me one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s a sweet good-natured tale about a loveable ex-villain who just wants to look after his girls and launch an exciting range of jellies and jams. It’s great to see a family movie that is fun in so many respects have such a warm-hearted and uncynical look at the family unit. Of course Gru is a single dad and so there’s also an important message sent out about single parents, he’s doing an ace job of raising his children. You could argue that it’s all a rose-tinted invention but I don’t care, it’s a U certificate family film after all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The references to other movies, works of art, and pop music. It’s incredible. I counted references to Alien, Desperado, World War Z, and many others. There are the minions’ takes on pop songs, which I will not reveal because for one of them, realising what the song actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; makes for one of the film’s funniest moments. I also realised when preparing this post that the still from the film that I chose as the hero image (fair use yada yada yada) is an homage to that famous photo of  workers sitting on the iron girders of some New York skyscraper that is under construction. You know the one. I am sure are loads more references that you will need the Blu-ray to sit down with in order to work them all out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These movies are probably the best advert for 3D - but only the end sections with the minions though. I didn’t actually see it in 3D (even though my main reason for wanting to see it a second time was to see it in 3D) but it is fairly obvious where the magic is happening. If you get the chance to see it in 3D (and you have money to burn) then you’ll probably get more out of it for this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally… “Bottom!”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, July 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-july-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-07-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-july-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another four albums for you this month. Sometimes the problem is not finding albums to listen to but actually finding time to listen to them! Often it is not because I don’t have time but because I have already found some great albums this month and I am busy listening to those instead. As a result, a couple of these albums are ones that I have only listened to for a week or so, but they are interesting enough to write about. Here are the four albums I am going to write about this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pet Shop Boys “Electric”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fuck Buttons “Slow Focus”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Holden “Inheritors”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ramin Djawadi “Pacific Rim OST”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pet-shop-boys-electric&quot;&gt;Pet Shop Boys “Electric”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the Pet Shop Boys releasing another album is like The Rolling Stones or Elton John releasing another album: it doesn’t really matter what the album is like, it’s just there to remind people to buy tickets for the latest money-spinning tour. The new songs just provide that moment where you can have a chat to your mate or go off to grab an over-priced hot dog or beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also been a while since the Pet Shop Boys released a decent album. At first I thought it was “Bilingual” all the way back in 1995 (though that’s only three-quarters the great album it could have been thanks to some poor choices about what songs went on the album and which went on the B-sides) but then I remembered that 2007’s “Fundamental” was also pretty good. In between they’ve released crap albums (“Release”, “Yes” anyone?), side projects (why yes, I’d love to hear a hypothetical soundtrack to “Battleship Potemkin” as I am sure that an archetypical eighties UK synthpop band are exactly who Eisenstein had in mind) and endless repackaged greatest hits compilations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that “Electric” is a pretty good album and a complete about-face from last year’s dreary “Elysium”. This is not to say that it matches the high points of their career: “Actually”, “Behaviour”, “Very”, but by this point they’ve earned the right to not have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviews have compared “Electric” to “Very”’s limited edition experimental companion “Relentless”. It’s certainly true that “Electric” shares with “Relentless” an experimental feel and a number of largely instrumental tracks where Neil Tennant’s vocals play second fiddle to Chris Lowe’s exemplary knob twiddling. But whereas “Relentless” was like this for all of its tracks and was very much introducing its intended audience to this type of music, “Electric” is a little more piecemeal and by this point the band are also pretty much preaching to the choir. Nevertheless there are some nice surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take opener “Axis” for example, it sounds like a mash-up (how early noughties!) between The Orb’s “A Huge Ever-Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From The Centre Of The Ultraworld” and the Pets’ own “In The Night”. Another track that follows in this largely instrumental vein is “Shouting In The Evening” which is, of all things, an attempt at a dubstep tune. The brilliant turn here is Tennant’s voice vocodered and squeezed into an auto-asphyxiating wheeze – an older man exhorting people to have fun through gritted teeth. More successful is “Inside A Dream” which creates a sound scape out of shimmering synths before a beat kicks in that would have sat happily on one of their mid-80s B-sides while an inconsequential vocal weaves in and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The out-and-out songs on “Electric” are better than they’ve been for ages. “Bolshy” manages to include a reference to the political convulsions engulfing the Bolshoi Ballet (just another example of their Russo-philia), while “Love Is A Bourgeois Construct” is as close to a canonical (some might say cliché) Pet Shop Boys song as they’ve allowed themselves to write for many a year. The “Bourgeois-bourgeois-bourgoisie” breakdown in the middle eight is pleasingly nutty. “Flourescent” manages to sound like it’s fallen off “Fundamental” and does that arch succes-de-scandale narrative that they’ve mined for ages quite admirably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Vocal” rounds out the album nice and trancily, though it sags a bit when they hit the line “aspirations for a better life are ordained”: it’s that sort of clunky phrasing that could only appear in a overearnest Pet Shop Boys song. It’s a shame because it’s a great song about how music pulls people together in a sense of celebration: it’s a song that they’ve been trying to write for ages (viz “Saturday Night Forever” off “Bilingual”) and it is the closest they have come to pulling it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the best songs on the album are a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “The First To Die” and a collaboration with Example called “Thursday”. The Springsteen cover is amazing because, just as they did all those years ago with Elvis Presley’s “Always On My Mind” and The Village People’s “Go West”, they manage to turn it lock, stock, and barrel into a completely convincing Pet Shop Boys song (heck there are even the clunky lyrics!). In fact I dug out the original (from one of the Boss’s more recent albums “Magic”) and it sounds more like a Pet Shop Boys song than the Pet Shop Boys version sounds like a Springsteen song. I wonder if one of their reasons for choosing it was because they noticed a similarity between it and another of their songs? I wanted to hate “Thursday” so much but it’s actually a really decent pop song and the rap from Example adds a significant extra dimension (in fact there’s even one of Chris Lowe’s “Paninaro”-style spoken word bits so they’re practically a boy band!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At nine songs and around fifty minutes, “Electric” spreads a lot of good ideas over a decent run time. It doesn’t match their peak but it’s certainly good enough for this casual Pet Shop Boys listener to enjoy. More importantly, if they perform “The Last To Die”, “Thursday”, or “Vocal” on the new tour, you might keep on dancing and not head to the bar after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fuck-buttons-slow-focus&quot;&gt;Fuck Buttons “Slow Focus”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck Buttons are one of those bands that I have not got around to listening to yet, which is a shame because now that I have I feel like I missed out until now. “Slow Focus” is an amazing album, not one that is suitable for all occasions but if you need a skull pounding inhuman sound scape for your Thursday morning walk to work, you won’t do better than this. Everything is tooled and precise, there’s very few sounds on this records that aren’t deliberate and mechanical. It’s very strange because it feels very real and yet to have this specific and intricate sound it has to be digital doesn’t it? It has to have been created inside a computer? That’s the only shade of grey on this album: how on earth was it made? It appears to be fully formed and completely abstract, like one of those monoliths in “2001: A Space Odyssey”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening track “Brainfreeze” is probably the pick of the bunch for me, all drums and sweeping synths buzzing around. Later on this weird riff comes in that when I first heard it sounded like chanted words; now I can’t think for the life of me what I must have been hearing. It’s a track full of layers ruthlessly applied over another and yet it holds up and never collapses under the weight of everything. At the exact midpoint the track empties out a bit and coagulates into something like one of those weird interludes on a Jean-Michel Jarre record, but this is just setting things up for the payoff where all the drums and beats start to flood back in: by the end it sounds like a hundred guitar solos being played at once before it all swirls down the plughole into the intro for the yelping, hyperventilating, “Year Of The Dog”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After “The Red Wing” and its hip-hop style beats comes “Sentients”, which basically sounds like Kraftwerk gone evil. If those robot arms that you see on production lines ever got the day off and went clubbing, “Sentients” is the song they’d be jumping up and down and spilling their WD40 and coke to. Like “The Red Wing”, “Prince’s Prize” also features a jaunty synth line and sounds a bit like a sample-free version of “White River Junction” of The Orb’s “Orbvs Terrarvm” album. In fact, the whole of “Slow Focus” sounds a bit like what The Orb might have achieved if they’d managed to go the whole hog with the industrial sounds they were exploring on that album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final two tracks, “Stalker” and “Hidden XS”, go the distance and open the sound right out to full on epic. As throughout the entire album, the sound of both tracks is metallic and ordered but things are lot more cinematic, particularly on “Hidden XS”. Last night I fell asleep listening to the album – you should take that as a sign of my tiredness, not the ability of this album to keep you awake – and when I woke up halfway into “Hidden XS” I listened and listened and it somehow felt like I was still asleep, still dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a purely instrumental and austere album “Slow Focus” has a lot to recommend it. Probably not one for when you have a migraine but if you want to party with some robots or just listen to something &lt;em&gt;crushing&lt;/em&gt; this is the album for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;holden-inheritors&quot;&gt;Holden “Inheritors”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patterns are one thing, texture another. If Fuck Buttons’ album is chock full of patterns, then Holden’s album “The Inheritors” is pretty much full of texture. You can hear it instantly on the opening track “Rannoch Dawn” which builds out of samples of pipes and drums, all twisted and distorted into different shapes. Here you can hear the inherently analogue sounds being digitally manipulated to within a thread’s width of sounding real. The thrill of it is quite a different one to that of listening to Fuck Buttons: instead of the brutality and inhumanity of the precision and control, you have the chaotic collapsing sounds falling and climbing over one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the tracks on “The Inheritors” remind me of the experiments of Laurie Spiegel (&lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-october-2012/&quot;&gt;whose album “The Expanding Universe” I talked about last October&lt;/a&gt;) and I read that James Holden is very much one for maintaining and tinkering with unusual synthesizers. Whereas Spiegel was mapping new terrain and had no guide for the sounds she was creating, here Holden draws on what sounds like a considerable imagination to chart onwards into a similar space beyond. The intriguingly titled “||: A Circle Inside A Circle Inside :||” is delightful confusion of flutes and shaky drum samples, while “Renata” shimmers like a modern pop song that just doesn’t happen to have any words, and “The Caterpillar’s Intervention” bounces along on a collection of broken beats and sheer joy: it’s the happiest bit of electronic music that you will hear all year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tracks like “Sky Burial” and “Inter-city 125” take things apart completely, abandoning beats for tracks that creak with texture instead. “Sky Burial” layers buzzes and clangs over what sounds like a rusty door hinge swinging open: it’s ugly and yet has a strange compelling beauty to it too, much like the ceremony that the track is named for. Meanwhile, I can’t find anything in “Inter-city 125” that reminds me of the train that was part of my very first Hornby set. It trundles along (in the sidings perhaps?) like a shuffling muted track that Fridge might have put on one of their earlier albums. It gradually adds clicks and riffs, and like the Fuck Buttons tracks, it then subtracts them as the track starts to fade away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the album “Gone Feral” is a much more lively track full of 8-bit noises that sound like characters bouncing around in a platform game from the early eighties. As with the rest of the tracks here it sounds like it could fall apart at any second and the livelier things get, the more it sounds like everything is going to collapse. The intense sounds around the 2:30 and 2:50 mark are amazing, and at about three minutes everything goes completely crazy for the rest of the track. If you get great satisfaction from blips and beeps and squelches and squoinks, you’ll be well served here. Meanwhile, the title track that follows immediately afterward is also pretty intense: a busy and chaotic track that teases various cacophonies over the top of an insistent beat, it’s another one for the blip/beep/squelch/squoink brigade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final track I will mention is “Blackpool Late Eighties” as it is the longest, most mellow track on the album. It starts off with a huge circling drone and some clipped beats, pretty much holding this pattern as chimes and cute synth patterns unfold over its eight minutes. It’s probably the most coherent track here and while much of the fun to be had on “The Inheritors” is from the moments where it feels like things are falling apart and the centre cannot hold, “Blackpool Late Eighties” is ultimately enjoyable because it feels luxurious and deep instead of fractured and cracked. Sometimes we need a little smooth with the rough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ramin-djawadi-pacific-rim-ost&quot;&gt;Ramin Djawadi “Pacific Rim OST”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a few words on Ramin Djawadi’s excellent soundtrack for “Pacific Rim”. He wrote the theme for “Game Of Thrones” so if you have seen that show (we’re big fans chez mattischrome) you’ll know exactly the kind of epic to expect. I haven’t seen the film yet (but hope to) though I know exactly what I am matching these sounds to based on the trailers! Basically it’s full of epic “Inception”-style …HONK…s and sweeping “we’re gonna kick kaiju butt” strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really good to listen to while walking to work in the morning. Instead of slouching through a North London suburb to a boring job, I’m swatting away alien creatures and stomping on white transit vans with a giant robot. Or something. That said, there’s plenty else to keep your interest: about a third of the way through there’s a touching weepy track called “Mako” and there’s an unexpected touch of sensitivity to “Physical Compatibility”. Meanwhile, tracks like “Striker Eureka” and “Pentecost” are as much about the drama as they are the robots-versus-giant-monster centred stomping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-last-july&quot;&gt;What about last July?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last July Olympic fever was building up to fever pitch ahead of the opening ceremony. I was so chuffed that it contained so much Underworld music and there was even a Fuck Buttons track involved, though cultural sensitivities being what they are they had to be referred to as “F Buttons” on the official soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That month I reviewed albums by BT, Monolake, Mohn and Actress. It was the month of black and white covers and fairly minimal electronic music. According to my iTunes stats I have listened to that Actress album a stack of times and yet whenever I put it on I can never remember how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder whether I bother to listen to any of these albums again after I have reviewed them, but it turns out that I have listened to three of those four albums in the last couple of months (and greatly enjoyed them too). I am quite pleased about this as it proves that it is good to seek out albums to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-the-july-before-that&quot;&gt;And the July before that?!?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-july-2011&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, back in 2011, I had a bumper crop of five albums in July&lt;/a&gt;. I remember writing this post because I wasn’t sure whether I was totally losing the plot over my comparisons of Zomby’s “Dedication” to Wire’s “Pink Flag” and SBTRKT’s eponymous album to 808 State’s “Gorgeous”. I think in retrospect neither of those comparisons holds up very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably undersold how much I liked Bon Iver’s eponymous album. It’s a fine album and it’s really nice to have it warbling on while you’re doing something else on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I haven’t listened to the Brian Eno poetry collaboration album “Drums Between the Bells” very much since, I might have to sit down with it again some time soon: it’s a fine experiment, if a little front loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that post I also wrote about how it took me a while to warm to Washed Out’s “Within and Without” and I continue to like it more and more each time that I hear it. Next month sees the release of the follow-up “Paracosm” and the lead-off singles have been &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good so I am looking forward to hearing it. If I recall correctly, it gets released toward the end of the month though, so I may not get to write about it until the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Neil Gaiman, The Ocean At The End Of The Lane</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane"/>
   <updated>2013-07-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“The Ocean At The End Of The Lane” is the new novel by Neil Gaiman. I was so intrigued by it that I bought the hardcover, which is unusual for me because I prefer paperbacks. I’d been excited by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/10/extract-ocean-end-lane-neil-gaiman&quot;&gt;reading the first chapter online at the Guardian website&lt;/a&gt; and from reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amandapalmer.net/blog/20130618/&quot;&gt;a blog post about the novel written by the author’s wife Amanda Palmer&lt;/a&gt;. I’d not read any of his novels before but they had long been on that “to read” list that is typically as long as your arm. I also enjoyed the movie adaptation of “Stardust” though I have no way (yet!) of knowing whether the film is as good as the original book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I devoured “The Ocean At The End Of The Lane” over the course of a hot weekend (it was the book that I was reading on the balcony &lt;a href=&quot;from-the-balcony&quot;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;). Though it is very easy to read, it is definitely a book for adults about adults despite the focus of the story being very much on children and childhood. Its main theme (to me) is that of how adults remember childhood and how the events we do not fully understand as children continue to resonate into our adult lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m determined not to spoil the plot so I will only say that it involves an ocean at the end of a lane. You might want to think about how an ocean might be at the end of a lane. You might in fact think of a small puddle or very small lake - and you’d be correct. So how can a small body of water like that be an ocean? Well, if you’re guessing that magic is somehow involved then you’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magical elements of the plot are surreal and wonderful, and yet also functional - with their own consistent internal logic. There are some delightful and diabolical characters and some downright scary moments - ones that I imagine might particularly challenge the parents amongst the book’s readers: when is your father actually not your father? Also reading chapter X during a thunderstorm will either be a peak experience or is not at all to be recommended, depending on your disposition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story ends with the narrative having gone full circle (sorry but no spoilers!) and this mimics not only the circular shape of the titular pond-cum-ocean but also of the act of picking up a storybook and immersing yourself in the tale within. In this way the reader is drawn into the story very much in the same way as the narrator is drawn in to his memories. It is this mirroring that makes reading the novel such a satisfactory experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our memories form a significant part of who we are. And of course our childhood is when much of identities are created both by us and for us, by own experiences and by the actions of others. Thinking more about just how powerful memory is - just how amazing it can be when we recall every detail of a peak experience, the terror when that capability begins to fade away - and how serendipitous the biology of it is, just blows my mind. The greater part of what we consider to be our self is in fact centred on electric sparks firing across a web of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that we have experienced or ever will experience, everything that forms us and changes us, is all down to the movement of ions between membranes in the buckets of goo that are our skulls. That’s why I have no problem with stories that involve magic: every single memory I have, every single sensation I experience (at the moment, mostly the annoyance of typing all of this out wrong), every sensory pleasure might as well be magic for all that we truly understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will forgive that rather strange digression! As with most books that I decide to write about on this blog, I am really enthusiastic about “The Ocean At The End Of The Lane” and I hope that you will read it too. If you have read it, I would to read about your impression of it in the comments. Also, please comment if you have something cool to tell me about the biology or neuroscience (neurobiology perhaps?!) of memory - I’d love to learn more! Finally, which Neil Gaiman novel should I try next?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ideas for TV shows: Great Mathematicians</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/ideas-for-tv-shows-great-mathematicians"/>
   <updated>2013-07-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ideas-for-tv-shows-great-mathematicians</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to see a TV show about great mathematicians of the past on a channel like BBC Four. Programmes about mathematics tend to be rather condescending, at least to anyone who has a bit of mathematical knowledge. Perhaps a way around this is to delve into the social and historical circumstances of the great mathematicians and how that along with their personality produced the mathematical results for which they are famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologise if this sounds like dumbed down nonsense to you. Personally, I can think of six mathematicians whose lives and results are interesting and important enough to create a series of great programmes. I’m thinking of those shows where scenes from someone’s life are re-enacted. Obviously you would need a bit of poetic license to augment what is already known, but as long as things weren’t too over the top it would be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put my six choices in chronological order. I am not sure you would need to do that for a series because if you were to make six more choices, they probably would fall in and these choices. For example there are many more interesting choices for a mathematician from antiquity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pythagoras of Samos&lt;/strong&gt; (c. 570BCE to c. 495BCE) would be included as his theorem that dominates high school mathematics is an obvious starting point for how mathematics became integral to western philosophy and science. You also have the intrigue surrounding the Pythagorean school that influenced organisations like the masons and the Rosicrucians. The Pythagoreans were also the first to rigorously apply the concept of proof to their arguments. Obviously mathematics got started a lot long before the work of Pythagoras and the exact origin of many mathematical concepts are still uncertain, but both the theorem and the cult associated with the man provide a fair amount of drama to be mined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī&lt;/strong&gt; (c. 780CE to c. 850CE), known colloquially as &lt;em&gt;Algoritmi&lt;/em&gt; (from whom we get the word algorithm), was generally held to be the father of Algebra by many Renaissance thinkers. Of course, as with Pythagoras of Samos, much of the results attributed to him come from the collation of older, more disparate, sources. However, he is interesting enough to be the focal point of an episode: one that shows how much of western thought is indebted to the work of not only medieval Islamic thinkers but also the Hindu and Buddhist thinkers and scientists that had influenced them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/strong&gt; (1642CE to 1727CE) is pretty much the daddy of all mathematicians. A true polymath who had a great influence on his age and who, by all accounts, was a bit of a git, should make for an interesting programme. Especially if you combine his work with his contemporary Leibniz (1646CE to 1716CE) who concurrently and independently conceived of calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Évariste Galois&lt;/strong&gt; (1811CE to 1832CE). Newton may well have the cultural sway because of his overall contribution but surely no mathematician exceeds Galois for dramatic life story. He died aged 20 in a pistol duel, he hung around with revolutionaries and was imprisoned for it, and in frustration he threw a board rubber at the august and revered Cauchy (series two maybe?) during an exam. He was a total badass. Oh and he conceived of a totally new way of thinking about algebra that totally proves something about quintics. It also made me cry while having to revise what the hell it was all about as an undergraduate. (Personally I think Galois needs his own film or, better yet, a musical.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Galois, &lt;strong&gt;Georg Cantor&lt;/strong&gt; (1845CE to 1918CE) lived long enough to be driven to the edge of sanity by the results he was able to prove about real numbers and set theory. For a long period of his life he suffered from what we now know as bipolar disorder but the results he was able to prove are wacky enough to make the heads of even the best of us spin. He proved that there are many types of infinities: this doesn’t have much to do with the price of fish but it has profound philosophical implications, hence the debilitating effect it had  on his psyche. Of course he wasn’t helped by a rivalry with Leopold Kronecker, a man who kept dismissing Cantor’s work and dissing him in public big time. While Cantor was not a happy man in his life time, he would be pleased to know that he laid the foundation for much of modern mathematics and things that his detractors dismissed are now crucial elements in basic analysis courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my last choice, I have chosen &lt;strong&gt;Sofia Kovalevskaya&lt;/strong&gt; (1850CE to 1891CE) because otherwise there would be no women. Mathematics does a poor job to this day of attracting women, which is a shame because there have been many important female mathematicians. For example Ada Lovelace, who is widely credited with assisting Charles Babbage in the creation of a prototypical mechanical computer called the difference engine; Emmy Noether, who made important advances in modern algebra and theoretical physics; and Hypatia, who wrote commentaries on Euclid and was cruelly murdered by Christians who skinned her alive with oyster shells. Sofia Kovalevskaya produced some important results on differential equations. In order to do so, she had to attend university but this was not possible in Russia at the time. She enrolled in Germany but needed permission from her father or her husband. Unmarried she nonetheless concocted a fictitious marriage in order to be able to study. Her “husband” would go on to collaborate with Charles Darwin. Tragically, she died of influenza in 1891, aged just 41.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those are my (first) six. You can see from my references to other mathematicians that there would be plenty of people to consider beyond that. I didn’t even mention Euler who was hugely prolific, had one eye, and had two “great” patrons in Frederick the Great of Prussia and Catherine the Great of Russia. And Ramanujan! And Erdös! Stay tuned for season two!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would you like to see dramatised in a series about great mathematicians? Please let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ibrahim El-Salahi At Tate Modern</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/ibrahim-el-salahi-at-tate-modern"/>
   <updated>2013-07-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ibrahim-el-salahi-at-tate-modern</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ibrahim El-Salahi is a modernist artist from Sudan. I believe this exhibition is a first for an African artist at the Tate Modern. Much like &lt;a href=&quot;choucair-at-tate-modern&quot;&gt;the Choucair show&lt;/a&gt; (which is still on everyone!), it’s an engaging but too short introduction to an interesting artist that you have probably never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pieces are roughly divided between large blank and white ink drawings that are mounted on multiple panels and oil paintings in earthy colours that depict abstract scenes. There are one or two pieces that buck this trend, such as “Portrait of Mrs. McKelvey” and a couple of other portraits toward the beginning of the exhibition. Frustratingly, pictures of his work are rather hard to come by online and the only two works that I was able to surreptitiously snap while at the show were the mesmeric “Reborn Sounds of Childhood Dreams I” and the mirage-like “They Always Appear”. (2020 Update: I have removed some images from posts, these being two of them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reborn…” is a stunning painting and it alone was worth the visit (if you are a member that is, but don’t worry there are plenty of other works that will justify the cost of your ticket if you’re paying to get in!). It is a dreamy collection of figures who contain other figures. It has a lot of the detail of his drawn works too, so it bridges the worlds of his paintings and his drawings very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his early years as an artist El-Salahi travelled widely and you can see from the first paintings in the show how he gradually absorbed elements of western art in to his painting. The islamic calligraphy never leaves his work though, the crescent moon is usually present somewhere and much like much of Choucair’s work, there is a balance that comes from using the shapes and compositional forms that are taken from the calligraphic tradition. One arresting piece is composed from Arabic letters, the forms dissolving in to abstraction at the periphery of the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later works are also influenced by his travels: the first room is dominated by three large drawings made in 2012. They were inspired by a recent trip to the Alhambra in Spain and they are quite a contrast to the works that opened &lt;a href=&quot;lichtenstein-at-tate-modern&quot;&gt;the Lichtenstein show&lt;/a&gt; in the very same room, the paintings in which Lichtenstein mocked the Abstract Expressionists with his Benday dots. Sadly, some of the works are also influenced by El-Salahi’s time as a political prisoner in Sudan and the works from the subsequent period in exile in Qatar are quite mournful. Consider the fact that “Reborn Sounds of Childhood Dreams II” from the mid 1980s is a black and white drawing filled with gaunt and haunting figures rather than the coloured and mystical figures of the earlier painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large number of the pieces in show are labelled as “from the collection of the artist”. In fact, it’s the first time that I have noticed it at all at a show. It made me think about what side of El-Salahi’s work we are getting to see. Is it the experimental side? One piece was an interesting experiment in which the canvas was smeared with oil paint and then covered with another quick drying titanium paint, allowing him to manipulate the still wet paint under the dry layer. Or are we seeing an under-appreciated side? Most of the pieces provided by the artist seemed to be the newer ones. There are also some wonderful works that appeared on book covers and I cannot remember what time period they were from but they certainly add to the collection. There are also magazine articles about his appearance as an actor in a film. These book covers and magazine articles are where the painter’s own collection is very useful in explaining his or her cultural impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalogue lists a great many more works, some of which are completely different to those on show and it would have been nice to see some of those in the flesh (like “One Ramadan a Scorpion Stung My Little Nephew”). Nevertheless there are some great pieces here and I appreciated the Tate Modern introducing me to another interesting artist that I would otherwise not have encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Don Delillo, Point Omega</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/point-omega"/>
   <updated>2013-07-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/point-omega</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There were no mornings or afternoons. It was one seamless day, every day, until the sun began to arc and fade, mountains emerging from their silhouettes. This is when we sat and watched in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I finished reading “Point Omega” by Don Delillo. I have wanted to read one of his novels for a while and though this is a slip of a novella, I certainly enjoyed it. I accidentally came across it when I looked at the wikpedia page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teilhard_de_Chardin&quot;&gt;Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&lt;/a&gt; last week as part of research for another post that I am writing. “Point Omega” seemed short and in keeping with what I wanted to write about, so I used my usual quick-draw finger on amazon and bought the thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, who is Pierre Teilhard de Chardin anyway? Well it won’t harm the other post to tell you a bit about him: he was a French Jesuit pastor who wrote and thought about the evolution of ideas. Specifically he developed the concept of the noosphere (building on earlier work by Vernadsky, who to my shame I know nothing about), a space in which knowledge and philosophies exist as tangible objects. The classic example is the one that is sampled on the Orb’s track O.O.B.E that opens their album “U.F.Orb”: if civilisation were destroyed but people and their knowledge remained, the world could be reconstructed pretty much as it was before, but if all the knowledge were destroyed (say the written and digital records of humanity’s great achievements) then perhaps the world as it was could never be reconstructed, at least not until the contents of the noosphere were re-discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teilhard de Chardin also proposed the concept of the so-called “Omega Point”, a point of ultimate knowledge and inter-connectedness to which humanity might evolve that would be a fixed point for the species. It is this concept that underpins the short and puzzling novella by Don Dellilo. The first task is to unravel exactly how it all pertains to the plot, not that there is much of one. A film-maker goes into the desert to try to convince a US apparatchik (Richard Elster) of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to discuss his role in sugar-coating the war in a bizarre interview-cum-art-film. After a while Richard’s daughter Jessie shows up and then she disappears. The action (such as it is) is bookended by two short episodes sent in front of an art installation featuring the film Psycho slowed to a pace that causes the film to last for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We’re a crowd, a swarm. We think in groups, travel in armies. Armies carry the gene for self-destruction. One bomb is never enough. The blur of technology, this is where the oracles plot their wars. Because now comes the introversion. Father Teilhard knew this, the omega point. A leap out of our biology. Ask yourself this question. Do we have to be human forever? Consciousness is exhausted. Back now to inorganic matter. This is what we want. We want to be stones in a field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways the slowed down version of Psycho is the Omega Point alluded to in the title, human actions slowed down to a glacial pace and stripped of meaning. The sensational deaths in the film (like the infamous shower scene) are put into a context where they no longer have any sense of emotional connection for the viewer. The person watching the installation in both episodes fixates on other details that are unseen, just as Elster focussed on things that did not matter while glossing over the war for his masters (declaring that he wanted a “haiku” war, of all things). The film maker also lets things slip between the frames and cannot observe everything, cannot make sense of Jessie’s disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing is spare with short empty sentences. It’s all pretty inscrutable. Yet somehow it satisfies with its tease of an ending and its pretension. It’s short enough for me to reread it again some day and in the mean time I will start looking into reading one of Delillo’s longer novels. If you have any suggestions as to which one, I would love to know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Michael Frayn, Skios</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/skios"/>
   <updated>2013-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/skios</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week I read “Skios” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Frayn&quot;&gt;Michael Frayn&lt;/a&gt; (who was born in Mill Hill). It’s another book from now customary pile of books that tends to develop around this time of year. &lt;a href=&quot;hawksmoor&quot;&gt;“Hawksmoor”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;the-marriage-plot&quot;&gt;“The Marriage Plot”&lt;/a&gt; were on the same ever-increasing pile. “Skios” is something of a change from what I normally read: it’s a comedic farce about stolen identities set on the (fictional) titular Greek island. Amusingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skios&quot;&gt;the wikipedia page for the novel&lt;/a&gt; currently reads “Praise for Skios was entirely misplaced”, probably thanks to some curmudgeon who doesn’t like the novel. Cue a ‘misplaced’ blog post about it, something that most people would consider to be business as usual for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief plot summary then. I will restrict spoilers to just those that are on the blurb. Oliver Fox is a complete cad and when he arrives in Skios to find that Georgie, his companion for the week, has been delayed by missing her flight, he assumes the identity of Dr Norman Wilfred. Dr Wilfred is in Skios to give a talk on ‘Scientometrics’ to a prestigious crowd of wealthy business owners and philanthropists at the fictitious Fred Toppler Foundation (it’s described in a way that is a sharp spoof of events like TED). Unfortunately the PR of the Fred Toppler Foundation, Nikki Hook, falls hook, line, and sinker (see what I did there?) for Oliver’s charms and so whisks him off to give “his” talk. All the while she’s lost in both romantic thoughts for Oliver and her desire to take over the running of the Foundation. The real Dr Norman Wilfred arrives a little later and through a comedy of errors ends up in an isolated villa with the wrong suitcase. Unfortunately Georgie also arrives at the very same villa and chaos ensues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very lightly written: the plot proceeds at a clip and you know pretty much guess how things are going to develop even as events evolve in their slapstick slalom. The characters are fairly perfunctory (especially the non-English ones) but you get a nice comparison between the ordered yet weary thoughts of Dr Wilfred and the guilty yet enthusiastic stream of consciousness of Oliver Fox. You also have Nikki Hook, who is determined to keep everything on the rails but, much like Dr Norman, she cannot see that the reality of her situation is completely different to how she perceives things. Georgie, like Oliver, has a flair for enduring chaotic situations; except, unlike Oliver, she has no idea how to extricate herself from them. Georgie’s situation is complicated further by the arrival of Oliver’s ‘second’ girlfriend Anuka: a wildly self-possessed woman who is frighteningly indignant about finding &lt;em&gt;another woman&lt;/em&gt; in her friends’ villa, particularly one who then asks whether she is the cleaner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the novel is the notion of how people are often deceived because they like to deceive themselves (or are complicit in their own self-deception). In order for the world to proceed as Oliver perceives it, he has to deceive other people. Georgie is deceived by Oliver into thinking that time with him will be exciting but you are also privy to her thought processes and you know that she knows that she is kidding herself. Georgie is perhaps the only character in the whole novel who knows that she is being taken for a ride and yet she willingly submits to it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Nikki does more to persuade herself that Oliver is Norman than Oliver actually does: all Oliver does is say “I cannot tell a lie” when Nikki asks him whether he is Norman; so Nikki deceives herself because it fits in with her dream of having a charismatic academic sweep her off her feet. Norman is duped by his own self-importance and later by his burgeoning lust for Georgie, a woman who is totally inappropriate for him physically and mentally. Also, the guests of the Foundation are all fooled by Oliver because they are seduced by his persona of the enigmatic say-nothing-mean-everything academic that is prized the world over by those who are attracted to the glamour of science but not its processes or rigour or attendant ‘boredom’. There is a perverse joy for the reader in knowing that Oliver is able to convince these people precisely because he is the opposite of who Dr Norman Wilfred really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while the book is very funny and not at all serious, something that you could dismiss as a whimsical farce that you could read on the beach: it also carries a deeper message about identity, self-perception and self-delusion. It just so happened that this was about the right time for me to read a novel like this, for reasons that I will explain in a later post. However in the past few years, in my job, there were times when I felt like Oliver Fox and there were times when I felt like Dr Norman Wilfred. There were also times when I felt like Nikki Hook. We all have that desire within us to insert ourselves as the hero of a particular story and often it drives us to be better than we would otherwise be. But we can also be subject to a lack of self-awareness that means we are not who we think we are, that we are not always carrying out the actions that we think the world sees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that aside though, this is a light-hearted and enjoyable novel that pokes fun at self-important academic people, the type that I once dreamed of being and now know that, thankfully, I will never be. I think you will enjoy it, especially if you are sitting on a beach somewhere and haven’t found goats where you were expecting the breakfast reception to be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, June 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-june-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-june-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just two albums this month as I am still enjoying last month’s albums so much (and I spent loads of time getting reacquainted with Boards Of Canada at the start of the month). I listened to a few more albums but not often enough to write loads about them so there is an “honourable mention” section at the end of the post that briefly discusses a few more albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, the two albums are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boards Of Canada &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow’s Harvest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jon Hopkins &lt;em&gt;Immunity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;boards-of-canada-tomorrows-harvest&quot;&gt;Boards Of Canada &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow’s Harvest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you no doubt know, “Tomorrow’s Harvest” is the first Boards Of Canada (BoC) album for nearly eight years. It arrived after a rather nifty viral campaign1 and the pre-release single Reach For The Dead got me so excited that I dived right back into their back catalogue in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for my back catalogue delve is that up until the start of the month I only owned a rather lush limited edition copy of their second album “Geogaddi”. For me, because I completely missed “The Campfire Headphase” back in 2005, this was the first BoC album for over a decade. I caught up on “Campfire” and found that it didn’t really compare to “Geogaddi”. Neither did their first album “Music Has The Right To Children” for me. I know it is probably a heresy to criticise a debut album that many consider to be a turning point in electronic music. I don’t really disagree with those kinds of statement, I just happen to think that “Geogaddi” is a better album with a more coherent story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Coherent story” is a phrase that comes up in my mind throughout as I listen to “Tomorrow’s Harvest”. Sonically it’s not too dissimilar to their earlier stuff, at least not on an initial listen. The difference between this album and their previous ones (with the exception of “Geogaddi” perhaps) is that every track seems to serve a purpose in the larger whole. On “Music…” and “Campfire…” part of the joy of those records is how the little interludes nudge the sound into little cul-de-sacs and new places. On “Tomorrow’s Harvest” it feels instead like no single note is wasted and that, in the sense of the truest ambient albums, every sound and beat and sample serves a place in an overarching narrative. It is linear, but with none of the negatives that that adjective might comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall theme of the album is a sense of post-millenial dread. It echoes through the desolate song titles (e.g. “Cold Earth”, “Sick Times”, and “Collapse” to name but three) and the artwork: empty spaces and bright blue skies, with agricultural scenes that appear to be abandoned due to either collapse or obsolescence. Much has been made of this sense of dread in reviews of “Tomorrow’s Harvest” and in the rare promotional interviews with the band. It was the same when Portishead returned after a long break with their album “Third”. So much was made of how much of a bummer their album was, it was almost as if people forgot how nice it was to have them back. (And as this weekend’s Glastonbury performance showed, how nice it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; is to have them back.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all that is made of the supposed “dread” on records like this one and “Third”, I think it really is a reflection of a long hiatus taken by a band. As you get older, you need longer to write songs: you know what counts against you, you’ve already written a few good ones and the new ones aren’t allowed to sound the same, you have so much more to say now, etc etc. The longer you take, the more likely it is that you will lift your head above the parapet and see the world as it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t find “Tomorrow’s Harvest” any more disturbing than a Radiohead album. The austere sound, the artwork and the song titles do make me think about what kind of world we are creating. The weird hypnotic robot voices on “Telepath” are quite discomfiting, suggesting that technology may not be the ally that we like to think it is. Certainly with things like PRISM in the news, that sensation is only heightened by looking for it in the real world. That said, there seems to be a happy ending of sorts. To my ears the closing three tracks “New Seeds”, “Come To Dust”, and “Semena Mertvykh” sound upbeat and positive. It squares off nicely and makes me want to play it again and again. And I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jon-hopkins-immunity&quot;&gt;Jon Hopkins &lt;em&gt;Immunity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2008’s “Insides” (not to be confused with Orbital’s 1996 album “In Sides”), Jon Hopkins has contributed to Coldplay’s albums “Viva La Vida” and &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2011&quot;&gt;“Mylo Xyloto”&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;2010-in-review&quot;&gt;collaborated with Brian Eno and Leo Abrahams on “Small Craft On A Milk Sea”, which was one of my favourite albums of 2010&lt;/a&gt; (and of course &lt;a href=&quot;uc16&quot;&gt;I love a bit of Eno&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-november-2012&quot;&gt;now and then&lt;/a&gt;). He’s also released an album with King Creosote, who also guests on the title track of “Immunity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I describe “Insides” to people as being “an ambient album with the shark attacks left in”. I was given a copy by a friend and first listened to it on a cold Easter in 2010, happily listening to the celtic strains that introduce “The Wider Sun” and the gentle atmospherics of “Vessel” (with the chiming bits that Coldplay borrowed) before being shocked by the breakbeats bursting in. It’s a delightfully heterogeneous album as a whole, though long sections are perfectly twinkly and ambient while the noisy interludes are satisfyingly crunchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Immunity” is as divided between uptempo work and slow chilled out numbers but it plays out as an arc across the eight tracks that basically tells the story of a night out. It starts out with some atmos that put me in mind of Four Tet’s fabric mix and sets off through four beat driven tracks, the best being the euphoric single “Open Eye Signal” and culminates in the nine minute “Collider” that stretches out and slowly decelerates across the centre of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of “Immunity” is very chilled out and is perhaps even more blissfully inert than the Boards Of Canada album. “Abandon Window” completely dissipates the clubby mood in a matter of seconds, quickly forming into a pool of reflective piano sounds and gentle synth hum (It’s very Eno-like actually) before resolving into a weird choir-like fog of noise. For its final four tracks, “Immunity” is in a wholly different mood, yet the sound of the second half is so in keeping with that of the first, that it doesn’t feel too strange. This is probably helped by the kinetic shuffles and glitches of “Form By Firelight”, which matches the hazy comfort of warmth to the gentle crackle of the flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even “Sun Harmonics”, which part way through breaks down in to the sound of almost nothing, has a strong insistent pulse wrapped around the sonics for most of the track. It is strange how these tracks can leave me with the memory of them being slow and quiet, yet when I re-listen to them, it turns out that they are full of strident pulses and interesting non-trivial details. For an album that is for the most part serene, it’s remarkable how busy the tracks often are. It’s a nice cognitive dissonance to experience and there’s no doubt that Hopkins will continue to produce albums that are both interesting and relaxing to listen to. I just hope he doesn’t wait five years next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;honourable-mentions&quot;&gt;Honourable Mentions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;False Idols&lt;/em&gt; by Tricky. I think of all Tricky’s albums since “Angels With Dirty Faces”, this is probably the one that sounds most like what most people want. It’s not a classic like “Maxinequaye” but there are some pretty good songs on here and his new vocal collaborator is probably about as close as he is going to get to Martina without actually getting his former muse back into the fold. I particularly liked “Do It”, “Nothing’s Changed” (which, like about five other Tricky songs, interpolates lines from my personal fave “Makes Me Wanna Die”), and “Nothing Matters”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wack Album&lt;/em&gt; by The Lonely Island. Comedy albums rarely remain funny for the length of an album, let alone beyond that. “The Wack Album” had its highs and lows but there are some genuinely funny songs here in a Weird Al Yankovic kind of way. I like how “Spring Break Anthem” is catchy enough to have you singing “something something / marry a man” after about 0.33 listens and how you as the listener realise before The Lonely Island do that they are going to get F’s for their definition of “Semicolons”. Elsewhere everything is very crude and will probably raise at least a smirk or two, at least for the next month or so, if you like that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More Tales From The Orbservatory&lt;/em&gt; by The Orb and Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry. This is pretty good. I still haven’t caught up on the parent to this little EP but I enjoyed the tracks here so I am really looking forward to hearing “The Orbserver In The Star House” at some point. (Minor point: the instrumental versions used to bulk out the track listing really don’t add much to the experience.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Peter Ackroyd, Hawksmoor</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/hawksmoor"/>
   <updated>2013-06-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/hawksmoor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Peter Ackroyd’s “Hawksmoor” was first published in 1985. I bought a recent reissue that forms part of Penguin’s decades collection whilst on a spree in Waterstone’s. It appealed to me as I recently realised that despite growing up in the eighties and nineties, I had read very novels that were either written or set in the eighties. Happily “Hawksmoor” is both of these, sort of. It also appealed to me because it is (again, sort of) a detective story and I’ve found myself getting into those lately. John Squire’s excellent artwork for the cover and the nice binding also helped to seal the deal: you don’t get that with an iPad or a Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For once I am certain that I will not give away too many spoilers because I am really not sure what to make of the ending to this book. Not in the slightest. If you’ve read it, feel free to leave a comment and explain what happened (Note: if people have done this and you haven’t read the book yet, avoid the comments!). I am sure I will read it again and try to work it all out as this is too good a book to not revisit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel split into two time streams that take up alternating chapters. In the first it is the start of the eighteenth century and Nicholas Dyer, apprentice to Sir Christopher Wren, has been commissioned to design seven churches for the city of London. His designs are motivated by a dark past endured during the plague and the Great Fire and he aims to consecrate each church with the murder of an innocent. The second strand takes place in the modern day and a series of murders are taking place in the grounds of Dyer’s churches. The lead detective is Nick Hawksmoor and he is having trouble finding who has murdered these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The olde-worlde section is written, as we are taught in our English Literature GCSEs, in a particular first person register that imitates the texts of the time such as Samuel Pepys diary. It’s a tour de force and exceptionally well constructed. It took me a while to get into the feel and rhythm of these sections but once I got used to it, it was so enjoyable to read. The narration is so chatty and full of itself that it does the remarkable job of making you like, and root for, a mad, satanic, egotistical, murderous, church-building architect. Here’s a brief extract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then the Weight of this Life fell upon me, and I could scarce speak. I went presently out of Scotland Yard into Whitehall: I walked to the Chandlery and then, to still my beating Mind, I entered into the Church-Yard beside the Abbey. I take Delight in stalking along by my self on that dumb silent Ground, for if it be true that Time is a Wound then it is one that the Dead may Heal. And when I rest my Head upon the Graves I hear them speaking each to each: &lt;em&gt;the grass above us,&lt;/em&gt; they say, &lt;em&gt;is of a blew colour but why do we see it and why are we not pluckt out of the earth?&lt;/em&gt; I hear them whispering, the long dead, in Cripplegate, in Farringdon, in Cordwainers Street and in Crutched Fryars: they are pack’d close together like Stones in the Mortar, and I hear them speak of the City that holds them fast. And yet still I burn at Walter’s recent words as this Thought comes to me: why do the Living still haunt me when I am among the Dead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that the odd Capitalisation and weird Antick spellings of Obscure words do most of the work in making the Text seem like it was wrytten in 1815 rather than in 1985. It makes you appreciate how English is constantly evolving as a language and how it can be expressed in many personal and vernacular forms. Often the best written books are the ones that take a joy in language and experiment with it too. Later on there are even play-like sections and songs, which add to the colour and flavour of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern strand, set in the eighties, is excellent to start with, taking the points of view of a victim and of a homeless man who, in a parallel of the eighteenth century story line, ends up homeless, mentally ill, and migrating to London. However, once the titular Hawksmoor was introduced, everything felt a bit rushed and undercooked. I think there is much more that could have been done with the character and the business of investigating the murders in the modern strand of the story. Ackroyd alludes to the parallels between the victims in the past and present, but to my mind never goes the whole hog in linking the perpetrator and the detective. If indeed they are linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first eight chapters take up over two thirds of the novel and in the last four everything spins out of control for both Dyer and Hawksmoor. Sadly the reader goes into a spin too (or at least this one did). Perhaps it was I who rush-read the end in my eagerness to reach the conclusion. Perhaps I feel a bit cheated because I waited so long for Hawksmoor to enter the narrative and when he did he was more a bit sub-Morse. Perhaps I have grown too used to detective serials on the TV in which the crime is solved in an hour of screen time in which I can usually predict the killer. Perhaps the events being described in the novel are madness and so should have no expectation of logic. It is a fiction after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my favourite book that features two parallel narratives is “Inversions” by the late Iain M. Banks. This novel, perhaps the least of his Culture novels by dint of featuring the Culture just barely, alternates chapters between two characters in two different situations and never brings them together at all - at least not in an explicit authorial sense. The whole purpose of that novel and its distinct interleaved plots is to invite the comparisons between the two (admittedly contemporaneous) stories. Would Hawksmoor have worked better with no overlap in its two parallel narratives? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the reservations and confusions discussed here, I enjoyed reading “Hawksmoor” and have no hesitation in recommending it. I will certainly read it again at some point in the hope of better understanding it. If you do read it and you &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; confused by the ending, feel free to post your explanation in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the book club I attended during my time as a PhD student in Bath, we once read a book called &lt;em&gt;Murther And Walking Spirits&lt;/em&gt; by Robertson Davies. I had no appetite for it at the time and barely read it. I think that I might enjoy that novel a little more now. Sometimes a book comes along at the wrong time and you just don’t get.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #24: Reservoir by Fanfarlo</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-24"/>
   <updated>2013-06-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-24</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have written a lot in these posts about how music gets indelibly tied up with places, events and feelings. For me this album by Fanfarlo is tied up with all three of these. It makes me happy and sad at the same time in memory of great times that are now gone but are fondly remembered. I am aware that this is the youngest album on the list so far and so it might be a bit early to endow classic status upon it, but “Reservoir” is a fine album and to my ears it stands up really well. Listening to it again in the course of writing this post I found that I remembered every note and musical phrase, and yet somehow I also managed to delight in hearing new features in the production that I’d not noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2009, I went to see Snow Patrol at the O2 in London. Having seen Snow Patrol for the first time in Moles in Bath just as “Run” was starting to break big, the O2 was precisely the biggest absurdest to catch up with where they had got to. It was quite a hard place to be a support act there like Fanfarlo were that night, they did seem a bit lost in the cavernous space. By that point I had already fallen in love with Reservoir though, so I was able to fill in the gaps despite only knowing their songs for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People quite rightly worry about piracy and about sites like the now defunct Megaupload, but that’s where I got my first copy of “Reservoir”. It was my source back then for taking a punt on a support act. Later on, I purchased the limited edition box set of the album and I also paid for a digital copy (for the bonus tracks) later on too. Nowadays Spotify fulfils the same role so my conscience is a little clearer but obviously for every Fanfarlo there are bands that didn’t persuade me to buy a version of their album all tied up in twine. (There’s also another luxury version that features a board game which I &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; bought as well!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the music. Let’s see if I can make a believer of you too dear reader. For ages I would tell friends that they sound like a cross between Beirut and Arcade Fire, but actually Fanfarlo are a combination of many more sources than that. Other inspirations include Bonnie Prince Billy, Tom Waits and Sigur Rós. The singles “I’m A Pilot” and “Drowning Men” are the songs most indebted to “Funeral”-era Arcade Fire, the first with its opening rolling crunch of drums forever ingrained with sunny dashes to the station in St Albans to catch the 8.33 to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, “Reservoir” is one of my most scrobbled albums on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/users/mattischrome/&quot;&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; simply because for six months it was one of the albums that most closely fitted to the duration of my commute. It’s funny that I can associate some songs with the morning commute: “I’m A Pilot” and “Ghosts” are connected with the walk to the station and “Finish Line” reminds me of getting to work, while the eerie whistles at the end of “Fire Escape” and the line “trees are scratching their patterns in the sky” on “Comets” remind me of walking to Mill Hill Broadway in the twilight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love “Fire Escape”, it’s one of my favourite songs of the last five years (along with most of last month’s Vampire Weekend album) and it also has a poignant video. (There used to be an embed here, but it got taken down. Such is the ephemeral nature of the internet. But at least I am still here guys… Guys?!?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always think of the line “why can’t he just think like us?” as being directly addressed to me. The songs that burrow the deepest within us are always the ones that we forge that relationship with. With its sing-song story and will-you-won’t-you suicide vibe (underscored by the video), the song certainly became a way that I could think about and then reject the unthinkable back towards the end of 2009. Plus it’s a really good tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other out-and-out great songs include “Luna” (another song about secrets) and “Howard T. Wilkins, or How To Wait For A Very Long Time” with its lines “your dreams will become part of the future / and coincide with the past” – very much the essence of my 2009 anyway. And that’s not even mentioning the manic coda of “They drive the same road drifting over to your side / They drive the same road turn the lights on again / They sail the same strait turn the lights on again” that you simply have to see live! Then there’s “If It Is Growing” which for me has the best lyric on the album and this lovely little piano riff that sounds (to me) a lot like the riff that gets played on the pianos in the piano store in &lt;a href=&quot;/why-i-love-betty-blue/&quot;&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/a&gt;. I think it is about cancer but I can’t be sure, and I’m less sure the more I hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems appropriate to end with “Finish Line”. Apart from the throwaway “Good Morning Midnight” (which actually closes the album), this was the song that it took me longest to love and I think things turned around when I got my box of the album because I finally got to read the lyrics. It was then that I realised how much this song resonated with me given that I had just finished my PhD. In fact, in July 2009 I did the whole cap-and-gown thing for (probably) the last time in my life. The lines “Last year was a good year, I beat myself to a bloody mess / But blue is the colour of the days I’m hoping for / What have you done to the mind you had? / Out there somewhere is the finish line” do a pretty good job of summing what it feels like to finish something massive and then have to carry on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that “Reservoir” is deeply bound to personal events in my life and that’s why it is so dear to me. Nevertheless I also think that from an objective viewpoint it is a really well made album full to the brim with great tunes and a warm-hearted sincerity. I think you would do well to entrust your memories and emotions to it too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Man of Steel: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/man-of-steel-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2013-06-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/man-of-steel-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I went to see the new Superman reboot &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt; with friends. I really enjoyed it, particularly the more reflective take on the superhero myth. Starting out with the fate of the planet Krypton, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approximately fuses the events of both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078346/?ref_=sr_2&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081573/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; original Superman movies. We get to see Superman’s arrival and childhood on earth and then the arrival of Zod, a maniac bent on replacing the earth and everyone on it with a new race of Kryptonians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the slower and more considered take on Superman’s youth as Clark Kent is really interesting and well made: should he intervene to save lives at the cost of revealing the extent of his powers? It’s really unshowy, almost like a mystery as Clark drifts from job to job remembering episodes from his childhood as he goes. For me that’s the best half of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man Of Steel&lt;/em&gt; is very much two films. After Zod shows up, some initially impressive fight sequences get repeated a bit too much for my taste. These scenes are also well made, there is a crushing heft to them and in a nod to audiences watching in 3D there’s lots of stuff that gets flung around and all sorts of people and tanks and trains get blasted through walls. Personally I liked seeing it without depth, though unfortunately the obvious &lt;a href=&quot;star-trek-into-darkness-a-short-review&quot;&gt;problems with movies that are made for 3D&lt;/a&gt; don’t necessarily vanish by watching the film in 2D. There are still scenes that are too busy and not only that, the ultraviolent smashing and crashing just gets a bit boring after a bit: all that excellent storytelling in the first half is just undone. It isn’t tense because you know that Superman will win and the fact that Metropolis is almost totally trashed by the end doesn’t seem to matter because – in a fashion reminiscent of &lt;a href=&quot;/fast-furious-6-a-short-review/&quot;&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 6’s tank&lt;/a&gt; – all the terrible aftermath is tucked away and the gigadeath that you don’t see isn’t really alluded to in the final scenes either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally some miscellaneous points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a tanker with a LEXCORP logo on it in one scene. Is this a little in-joke or will there be a sequel featuring Lex Luthor?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Russell Crowe is not that annoying as Jor-El, which was a surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Henry Cavill, who plays Clark/Kal-El/Superman is pretty good in Immortals, the underrated swords and sandals epic from director Tarsem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Michael Shannon’s voice as Zod seems to be channeling The Brain from “Pinky and the Brain”. Fitting as he is trying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5TU8o6TvNk&quot;&gt;“take over the world”&lt;/a&gt;. Needless to say it’s not as good as Terrence Stamp’s rollicking turn in &lt;em&gt;Superman 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These are the rules of black holes in this movie: a) to be exiled in a black hole, you get sent there in a penis-shaped rocket, b) if you get sent to one you grow a goatee beard, and c) they automatically close once all but one of the bad guys has disappeared into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That’s not an S, it’s a Kryptonian symbol for hope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, May 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-may-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-05-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-may-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;lilacs--champagne-danish--blue&quot;&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne &lt;em&gt;Danish &amp;amp; Blue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember that last year &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-february-2012&quot;&gt;I reviewed the first Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne album&lt;/a&gt; and I liked it a lot. This album sees them back with more of the same: taking the approach that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. There are very few changes to the formula apart from the fact that the spoken word samples are not quite as good this time and there’s a bit more Grails-like guitar solo action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action is bookended by two tracks “Metaphysical Transitions” and “Metaphysical Transitions II” that feature an ageing hippy singer pronouncing how “this album” features songs that come from him ‘getting his shit together’. In between I don’t think this is quite as good an album as the first one. Some of the tracks, like “Sour/Sweet”, are a bit on the sketchy side - it’s a great idea but it’s too short and doesn’t go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the longer tracks I really like “Le Grand”, which sounds like something that Mike Oldfield would make if he were to adapt his classic sound to something more modern, and “Refractory Period”, which takes the best of the first album and runs with it. Overall, it’s a decent enough album but I still prefer the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-phoenix-foundation-fandango&quot;&gt;The Phoenix Foundation &lt;em&gt;Fandango&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written an album digest on the last of each month since &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-january-2011&quot;&gt;January 2011&lt;/a&gt; and in that first set of reviews, I wrote about The Phoenix Foundation’s excellent album “Buffalo”. That album busted the band out of their homeland isolation (they’re from New Zealand) and moved them on to the international scene. “Fandango” is the follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas “Buffalo” was essentially smooth and languid pop record, “Fandango” cuts loose with the instrumentation a little more and is a messier longer album. This is something that I actually wanted from “Buffalo” but I think “Fandango” is a bit shorter on quality tunes - certainly only opening track “Black Mould” is the only track that really comes close to replicating the joyous rush of “Buffalo”’s title track or the brilliantly weird “Apple and Mango”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you get in place of weirdness is a worthy attempt at musical diversification. “Fandango” is full of breathing spaces and dead ends. There is some lovely work here: the little coda at the end of “Inside Me Dead”, all of “Corale”, the gentle drones and chants of the almost eighteen minutes long closer “Friendly Society”. Yup, it’s the second month in a row that an album that has an enormous track on it. This time it’s stuck at the end so it allows the album to peter out in to a sort of trippy haze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think “Fandango” is a little too long, there are plenty of places where it could be a bit snappier and some of it seems like a little too much jamming went on to the finished record. That said, I’d be prepared to bet that it sounds great live and on a sunny morning when you haven’t much to do but lie in bed listening to cool music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-national-trouble-will-find-me&quot;&gt;The National &lt;em&gt;Trouble Will Find Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve managed to avoid talking about The National on these pages, which is strange because they are one of my favourite bands. Their album before last “Boxer” is one of my all time favourites and is due for an understated classics treatment soon (by about December if I stick to my plans and I never do). Meanwhile, “Trouble Will Find Me” follows on three years after 2010’s excellent “High Violet”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I found “Trouble Will Find Me” to be a little too morose, even compared to other albums that they have released. Opener “I Should Live In Salt” sets the tone with its Lear-themed confession of guilt for some past abandonment. The trouble is, it has the same scuzzy backing as “Terrible Love”, the song that opened “High Violet”. Fortunately the album finds its feet later on and after a number of listens, as the hooks begin to sink in, I found it to be incredibly interesting and quite perky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, there are examples of the humour in the lyrics that can also be found throughout “Boxer”, while the band are also clearly trying to push against their own templates: witness the wonderful overlapping of vocal lines on “Don’t Swallow The Cap” and the gravelly sing-song lilt of “This Is The Last Time” (the key lyric: “Don’t tell anyone I’m here / I’ve got Tylenol and beer”). Elsewhere there are more pro forma songs, songs that you would pick out instantly as songs by The National: like “Fireproof”, which wouldn’t have been out-of-place on “Alligator” but is redeemed by its origin story of having been recorded in just one take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final track “Hard To Find” is absolutely gorgeous, part of long tradition of albums by this band having great closing songs. “Hard To Find” is only a hair’s width away from being something by Bruce Springsteen: it has that eerie twang of the boss running through it, the sound of a song that’s been lived in. And that’s the key selling point of The National to my mind: even though they are playing a role, the songs always feel lived in and alive – it’s always real, even when it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vampire-weekend-modern-vampires-of-the-city&quot;&gt;Vampire Weekend &lt;em&gt;Modern Vampires Of The City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be very surprised if a better album than this one is released this year. “Modern Vampires Of The City” is such a great album that it reminds me why I still listen to albums. It’s a coherent all-in-one piece consisting of strong songs that each would stand as well on their own. To me, it is one to add to the classic album pile along with “OK Computer” by Radiohead, “Pink Flag” by Wire, and “Revolver” by The Beatles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always tell you’re on to a winner with an album if the first track alone makes you want to listen to it over and again in order to dissect and understand it. I’m not talking about a strong single but rather the moment at which you have to listen repeatedly because it changes the way you feel about a band you already know. Think of hearing “Airbag” by Radiohead after hearing just “The Bends” (and ok, “Paranoid Android” and two of its four B-sides), well you get the same experience with “Obvious Bicycle”. I listened to it and it was obviously Vampire Weekend, and yet you can hear that something has aged within the band. Now it really feels like they have something to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they had something to say all along. After the wistfulness of “Obvious Bicycle” was always there on, say, “Giving Up The Gun” off Contra, but this time they play it straight: there’s no Tokugawa smile or rusty swords this time. When I first heard the lines “Why don’t you spare their world a traitor / Take your wager back and leave before you lose”, it really cut deep. At first it seems quite harsh, almost like saying “Well, why &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; you jump?” but after repeated listens the humanity of the whole song – about how we are all desperate for people to listen to us and understand us – shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next song “Unbelievers” is probably the best song about agnosticism ever written, or at least the best song that uses agnosticism as a metaphor for a détente in a relationship that you will have heard in quite a while. Not only is it lyrically excellent but that somehow celtic sounding rising guitar line in the middle eight is wonderful. Whereas on “Contra” the musical arrangements served to showcase some of the showiness of the lyrics, here a different tack is employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess “Step” could have been on “Contra” but while here it’s part of a sustained peak, on the previous album it would have been a stellar highlight. They finally sound like they’ve found a way to use all that wordiness – which is actually conspicuous on “Step” because of it being largely absent in the other songs – and draw out an emotional connection with it. Somehow a song with a line that ends “Mechanicsburg, Anchorage, and Dar Es Salaam” can actually draw an emotional hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With “Diane Young” they try what could be thought of as the opposite trick: they couple a (relatively) direct and populist lyric based on a pun to an exhilarating music backing feature surf guitar and manipulated vocals. It’s as visceral and exciting as “Stealth Of A Stork” off the Wire album from last month. After that “Don’t Lie” and “Hannah Hunt” channel the sounds of Wilco and Death Cab For Cutie respectively into unusually direct songs that meditate on death and the end of relationships. The latter recalls Death Cab’s “Tiny Vessels” though the outcome (to me, maybe I’m thick) is a little more ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have to be brief about “Everlasting Arms”, “Finger Back”, and “Worship You”, but suffice to say they are excellent too. If their first two albums paid homage to Paul Simon circa Graceland, then this is the point at which imitation breaks out of the mould, the point at which the apprentices break free from the past and start to shape their own direction. “Finger Back” is particularly awesome with its masochistic verses inviting mutilation from a lover and the pay-off line: “I don’t wanna live like this / But I don’t wanna die…” – here the ends of relationships and deaths might as well be the same thing. Meanwhile, I defy anyone to sing along to the verses of “Worship You”, they’re delivered at a breakneck pace and far faster than any rapper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first “Ya Hey” seems to continue the themes of the preceding three songs but then the chorus starts up with its twisted manipulated “ya hey”’s that contort and distort and go all high-pitched like something by The Chipmunks (and after a few listens you hear the slowed down repetitions too), it’s quite shocking at first but quickly becomes a massive guilty pleasure. It has a lot to say too, pitching itself in with the meditations on life and death and one’s place in the world that inform the other tracks. It feels less agnostic and more like it comes out of a dialogue with a god, but then who hasn’t been in a relationship where a partner starts to feel more and more like some sort of deity equally capable of handing out pain and pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we have “Hudson” and “Young Lion”. The latter is a little throwaway song with one line in the lyric booklet, something that just rounds off the whole album nicely. This is because to end with “Hudson” would have been a little bleak: it’s a bleak end of days story song that moralises “Some men tend to linger on / And some make haste from Babylon / Some will roam their ruined home / Rejoicing ‘till the end”. There’s a wonderfully eerie B-movie riff that underpins things throughout that could only sound spookier if it had been performed with a theremin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Modern Vampires Of The City” is fantastic (fang-tastic?). I think I’m satisfied that it will be my favourite album of the year by December, unless something really new and surprising turns up before then. In the mean time, this is a brilliant album that reflects upon themes that I have found myself reflecting upon and moreover, is a musical feast for the ears throughout. Buy it, and buy another copy for someone you really like.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>George Bellows At RA</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/george-bellows-at-ra"/>
   <updated>2013-05-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/george-bellows-at-ra</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I went to see “George Bellows 1882-1925 Modern American Life” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/george-bellows/&quot;&gt;at the Royal Academy of Arts&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the first time I’ve been to the RA but I was emboldened by my art pass and the fact that Bellows was a contemporary of Edward Hopper, a painter whom I admire greatly. This is the first major retrospective of Bellows’ work in the UK and taking in his wonderful paintings this afternoon, I felt a little embarrassed that I hadn’t seen anything of his before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bellows gained notoriety for his boxing paintings. In the hero image above, which shows the advert for the show, the painting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artfinder.com/story/george-bellows-stag-at-sharkeys-1909/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Stag At Sharkey’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1909) has been incorporated. It’s a great painting that simultaneously captures the raw energy of the fight and the seedy atmosphere of what would then have been illegal boxing venues. I will return to the boxing pictures again later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/George_Bellows_New_York.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;George Bellows, New York&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; (1911, above) does feel like a familiar iconic painting though, so maybe this one had crept into my consciousness somehow. It is an invented scene however, this square does not actually exist. Like many paintings it has qualities that simply don’t appear in its jpg facsimile, namely a bustling energy. The painting itself is an intriguing window into life in cities prior to the revolution that would be caused by the impending automobile – we can see a bustle of people and horses and carts, I think I can make out trams too. It’s almost strange to see a picture of New York without a yellow taxi anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in another picture called &lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_Wesley_Bellows_-_Snow_Dumpers_(1911).jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Snow Dumpers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (also 1911), Bellows depicts men dumping snow that has been cleared from New York streets into the Hudson River after they have loaded it on to carts. It’s a strange window into another world and proof that the show’s subtitle “Modern American Life” is rather tongue in cheek!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/George_Bellows_Summer_Night_Riverside_Drive.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;George Bellows, Summer Night Riverside Drive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite paintings in the show - one that I lingered over - is &lt;em&gt;Summer Night Riverside Drive&lt;/em&gt; (1911, above), a night scene illuminated by lots of different light sources. It is a dark painting dominated by the impressionistic leaves that blur behind the shining gas lamp. By contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dia.org/object-info/82f9be1b-4e32-4e2e-83c7-4da046833463.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Day In June&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1913) is a bright summery scene set in Central Park filled with women wearing white carrying flowers and parasols. In the show these two paintings are hung close to one another, inviting these comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/George_Bellows_Blue_Snow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;George Bellows, Blue Snow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really enjoyed looking at &lt;em&gt;Blue Snow The Battery&lt;/em&gt; (1910, above), there is a real spookiness to the blue shadows being cast over the blue snow. Many of the paintings in the show are quite varied in their use of colour (look back at &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;) but this is one is quite restrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/George_Bellows_Dempsey_and_Firpo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;George Bellows, Dempsey and Firpo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dempsey and Firpo&lt;/em&gt; (1924, above) is one of the last paintings that Bellows completed before he died of peritonitis aged 42. It harks a return to the earlier boxing paintings (he continued to make images of boxing throughout the intervening years, particularly in his lithograph work). Boxing was legal by then and you can see it in the painting: the action now takes place under bright lights and you can see the fighters’ colours. The action remains as dramatic as ever with the eventual champion Dempsey having just been put through the ropes by Firpo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this exhibition and as parochial as this might sound, it was really great to see some paintings that weren’t completely abstract and actually gave an insight into the past. It was certainly interesting to get up close to some great big oil paintings and admire the technique involved. The exhibition ends with the following quote and I shall do the same with my review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Try everything that can be done. Be deliberate, be spontaneous. Be thoughtful and painstaking. Be abandoned and impulsive. Learn your own possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Bellows, 1920&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Choucair At Tate Modern</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/choucair-at-tate-modern"/>
   <updated>2013-05-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/choucair-at-tate-modern</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I went to see the Saloua Raouda Choucair show at the Tate Modern. As it was quite small, I went to see &lt;a href=&quot;/lichtenstein-at-tate-modern/&quot;&gt;the Lichtenstein show&lt;/a&gt; again as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choucair is an underrated Lebanese artist and many of the paintings and sculptures shown were created in the fifties and sixties. Her sculptures in particular are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first room is lined with paintings that were nearly all gouache on paper, about 40cm by 30cm. These paintings were vibrant and abstract. I prefer larger oil paintings and it took me a while to get to grips with the small format and the bright colours, but they are really quite wonderful: the colours swim and dance in front of you. I thought the nudes were particularly interesting, mainly because nudes are executed by almost every artist at some stage (there are some rather spotty ones by Lichtenstein for example) and are usually quite memorable – so seeing an artist’s nudes can give you a point of relation to other artists. Choucair’s nudes are pink and ample and altogether the more charming for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second room there were four large sculptures and some larger oil paintings that I liked a great deal: particularly &lt;em&gt;Composition in Red&lt;/em&gt;, which was probably my favourite painting in the show. There was also a plinth showing off ten exquisite medium-sized sculptures (here “medium-sized” is in terms of the show, I mean about 15 by 15 by 20cm) with a few more small gauche paintings hung behind them, mostly experiments with calligraphy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger sculptures in the room resemble tower blocks, particularly &lt;em&gt;Infinite Structure 1963-5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sculpture with One Thousand Pieces&lt;/em&gt;. The first is on the cover of the exhibition guide, a wonderfully dry yet aesthetically pleasing brick tower consisting of pieces that look deformed (if you think of how bricks should look like) or completely natural (like vertebrae), depending on how you look. The latter really does seem to be made from a thousand pieces and looks even more like a tower block, complete with levels and windows. The piece is not uniform so the detail within it changes with your perspective, hence “a thousand pieces” I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the larger pieces in this room is &lt;em&gt;Poem&lt;/em&gt;, which is similar to the &lt;em&gt;Poem Wall&lt;/em&gt;. This, and similar sculptures, are inspired by arabic poetry, which unfortunately I don’t really know enough about to comment on exactly but according to the exhibition notes Sufi poetry has a unique modular stanza style wherein each stanza must read as an independent poem while interlocking with the others. This interlocking structure of independent components is a common motif in many of Choucair’s sculptures (and, it could be argued, in some of her paintings).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the plinth of smaller sculptures, these were the cause the alarm going off a number of times while I was there: people (myself included) would lean in past the line to examine these wonderful pieces in wood and fibreglass because they are simply marvellous. There was a real sensuality and vivaciousness to these pieces - my particular favourite was &lt;em&gt;Secret of a Cube&lt;/em&gt;, a cube of wood hollowed out with a heart-like structure remaining within it that is so alive that it almost seems to be caught mid-beat. Many of these pieces are in parts and explore the meaning of forms that go together and complement one another. The sculptures take forms that are simultaneously natural and yet created with artistic intent, they seem to have resolved from their materials without the intervention of the artist and yet &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; works of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third room contains lots of miniature sculptures and maquettes (preliminary models for larger sculptures), along with plans for fountains and other architectural features. A lot of Choucair’s work was interrupted by the civil war in the Lebanon. This can be seen in &lt;em&gt;Two=one&lt;/em&gt; (the only painting in this room), which has holes in it and shrapnel embedded in it from when the gallery in which it was being shown was bombed. Rather than restore the painting, the artist chose to leave it in its new state in order to demonstrate the ways in which war impacts on cultural life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth and final room is the jewel in the crown, at least for me (though that second room does come very close). There are six sculptures and involve components in either plexiglass or metal that are combined together with strands of plastic. The pieces either hang in mid-air or from a frame. All seem architecturally inspired and very geometric. The one I found most inspiring was &lt;em&gt;Trajectory Of One Line&lt;/em&gt;, which looks like a spirograph drawing rendered in three dimensions. The threads that hold it together, much like the colours in her gauche paintings, begin to blur and sing at you. When you lean in closer (no alarms this time thankfully) you see the very precise nature of the piece’s construction, where the needle has threaded the piece together: in through there and out through there, it almost becomes a performance that you imagine happening in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this is a short but entertaining show that will introduce you to a talented and underrated artist. This is as important thing to see in the Tate Modern as the greats and I highly recommend it. The book that accompanies the show is fairly expensive but it is a good read and I think I will go back for another look when I have finished it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #23: Gorgeous by 808 State</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-23"/>
   <updated>2013-05-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-23</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was quite hard to choose an 808 State album for the &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;understated classics series&lt;/a&gt; for two reasons. The first is that I was introduced to 808 State quite late through a friend’s sister’s cassette copy of The Shamen’s En-Tact (the original version recorded from vinyl that had a thirteen minute version of “Evil Is Eden”) that also had – to fill out the C90 – the full length sweary version of “What Time Is Love?” by The KLF and four tracks: “Cubik”, “Pacific”, “Olympic” (I think…), and “In Yer Face”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That early introduction only served to flag up the name and in the days when you had to wait months between album purchases (on cassette!) I didn’t really get any more 808 State until I bought “Lopez” from “Don Solaris” on &lt;em&gt;cassette single&lt;/em&gt; mainly because, if I recall correctly, I was mad on The Propellerheads at the time and wanted their remix. I soon came to prefer the languid original though, and eventually, in 1998 I bought the cassette version of their Greatest Hits (at the time) &lt;em&gt;808:88:98&lt;/em&gt;. Happy days. An album so good that I tracked down a CD version on eBay a while later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So reason number one is that my overall favourite 808 State album is that undoubtedly fan-polarising compilation, chiefly because it’s hooked in to bobbing between home and college (a good hour’s walk) believing that I was the only person of my peer group remotely interested in this music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason number two is rather more prosaic. I now own five studio albums by 808 State and I really can’t decide which I like best. I also have another compilation – &lt;em&gt;Blueprint&lt;/em&gt;, released a few years back – and even that is interesting for its own reasons (but can’t beat the heady A to B rush of &lt;em&gt;808:88:98&lt;/em&gt;). In the end I’ve decided on 1993’s &lt;em&gt;Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; because it’s the “one in the middle” and it happens to contain &lt;em&gt;Plan 9&lt;/em&gt;, which is my all-time fave 808 State track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you a track-by-track trip through the track list but you should there’s some good stuff on here, not least the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Plan 9&lt;/em&gt; (a beautiful lilting guitar riff with an urgent but not over the top bass line), &lt;em&gt;One In Ten&lt;/em&gt; (the UB40 collab that references unemployment statistics that I instead collared as my own personal bisexual pride anthem), &lt;em&gt;10x10&lt;/em&gt; (the uplifting house anthem that will leave you smiling for days), &lt;em&gt;Moses&lt;/em&gt; (featuring Ian McCulloch in the Bernard Sumner role – see &lt;em&gt;EX:EL&lt;/em&gt; for more details), and &lt;em&gt;Europa&lt;/em&gt; (a beautiful intro with bells and a bizarrely Stock, Aitken &amp;amp; Waterman spoofing female vocal). Oh and &lt;em&gt;Contrique&lt;/em&gt; samples &lt;em&gt;She’s Lost Control&lt;/em&gt; by Joy Division!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only issue with the album is a weird quirk of the sequencing. There are fifteen tracks and regular readers will know that I love a short album, so I’d prefer it if &lt;em&gt;Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; ended with the moody drum-centred &lt;em&gt;Colony&lt;/em&gt; (a nice eleven tracks if you don’t mind). Instead the remaining four tracks – &lt;em&gt;Timebomb&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stormin’ Norman&lt;/em&gt; (How nineties a reference is that!), &lt;em&gt;Sexy Dancer&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sexy Synthesizer&lt;/em&gt; – add pretty much another EP on to the end of the album. It doesn’t help that &lt;em&gt;Stormin’ Norman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sexy Dancer&lt;/em&gt; are actually awful. I quite like &lt;em&gt;Sexy Synthesizer&lt;/em&gt; though, it reminds me of &lt;em&gt;Last Train To Trancentral&lt;/em&gt; by The KLF and perhaps its pairing with &lt;em&gt;Sexy Dancer&lt;/em&gt; has some sort of “Revenge of the Nerds” thing going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall though, &lt;em&gt;Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; is a pretty amazing sounding album that has aged well to my ears, only those last two tracks (and possibly the faux saxophone of &lt;em&gt;Black Morpheus&lt;/em&gt;) sound vaguely nineties. The rest is finely honed and stylish modern dance music that you really should wrap your ears around some time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lichtenstein At Tate Modern</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/lichtenstein-at-tate-modern"/>
   <updated>2013-05-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/lichtenstein-at-tate-modern</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was a show that I had put off going to see for quite a while now. Looking online at the pictures featured in the show did not really excite me enough to get out and see it. I’d seen &lt;em&gt;Whaam!&lt;/em&gt; before in isolation (it’s part of the Tate collection and will no doubt return once the retrospective show is over) and it didn’t really grab me, arresting as it is. However, with plenty of free time this week it was an ideal time to go see it and I was happy to be proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few rooms didn’t really turn me on: I found myself pining for the Rauschenberg paintings I’d seen at the Barbican back in March. The sharp austere lines and primary colours did not seem like any match for Rauschenberg’s muted palettes and abstract brush strokes. However, like a good retrospective should, the show hits its stride just as Lichtenstein appears to have done: during his pop period. It was this point that I realised just how disciplined and cohesive every painting from this period is: eventually the austerity makes sense and those eye-bending realms of Benday-dotted primary colour just pop off the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those paintings are helped by being enormous and are arranged beautifully in a long room with benches. There are also stands with notes and the original comic book source for &lt;em&gt;Whaam!&lt;/em&gt; that are interesting to compare to the finished painting. The paintings make me think about how in Lichtenstein’s work two strands of twentieth century art converge: the modernism of the De Stijl group (the primary colours separated by thick black lines can’t help but bring Mondrian’s compositions to mind) that lead to the abstract expressionism that Lichtenstein had begun by experimenting with, and in the use of everyday objects as subjects, the “ready-made” sculptures of Duchamp. I am fast becoming a big admirer of Duchamp so this was a pleasant revelation. It also helped to tie things in nicely with the “A Bigger Splash” exhibition I went to in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show definitely peaks with those pop art paintings in the large room and with the really beautiful seascapes in the room afterward. After that, the works in homage to previous artists like Picasso and Monet are a worthy attempt to contextualize his painting style in the modern art canon but, for me, the pop art work does that by itself. I really liked some of the homages though, the triptych that is Set 5 of the Rouen Cathedral series is really pretty in person. After that, there were some additional high points like the perfect and imperfect abstractions in Room 10 and the Chinese Landscapes in Room 13, but much of the last half of the show did not seem to add much more. (We can compare this to the Kusama and Miró shows, where there were genuinely stunning pieces later on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be said that one of the reasons why I enjoyed my visit so much was the fact that actually &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; these paintings is so much better than seeing reproductions of them. All those dots just swim around in front of your eyes especially when they are imitating printed media but at a larger scale – when they are reproduced in the catalogue at nearer to the original size of the comic book sources, much of the impact is lost, not to mention the irony of the Benday dots being reproduced by laser printer pixels. One thinks of Blake’s fleas…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show runs for another week. I’m going back to Tate Modern later on this week to see the Saloua Raouda Choucair show and I think I will be pretty tempted to nose around the Lichtenstein once more. See it if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jeffrey Eugenides, The Marriage Plot</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-marriage-plot"/>
   <updated>2013-05-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-marriage-plot</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“The Marriage Plot” by Jeffrey Eugenides is a novel about love and growing up set in the privileged world of US academia in the early eighties. The main plot concerns a love triangle involving two guys and a girl. Madeline Hanna, the girl at the apex of the love triangle, is the main focus of the novel and the majority of the novel is told from her standpoint. I think her sections are incredibly well written but I’d love the thoughts of a female reader, in case it is actually all a horribly male way of seeing through a young woman’s eyes. In love with Madeline (and the guy that we meet first) is Mitchell Grammaticus, an overly deep guy who is terribly concerned about whether he is doing the right thing in the world. He thinks that religious studies is for him but later finds that it is harder to live up to your ideals than you first imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Madeline falls in love with Leonard Bankhead, a biology major who is (unknown to Madeline) grappling with manic depression. When the story is told from his point of view, there is some really great writing about mental illness that is sensitive and heart-felt. It really gets to the nub of how difficult it is to seek treatment for depression, how easy it is for people around you to not notice the signs of feeling bad, how families sometimes unfortunately magnify hereditary problems simply because there was once no expression or explanation for these illness, and how selfish one can feel while being treated for supposedly just feeling bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I won’t tell you who ends up with who, but you might be wrong footed by Madeline’s thesis on “the marriage plot” of the title. These are the plots in the novels by Austen and her contemporaries where after some strife and difficulty, the heroine marries someone and all the relationships in the novel are neatly tied off. This doesn’t really happen in this novel: its characters may borrow features from those plots but they are altogether more modern and as a result the ending is a little more modern and complicated, but it does end in the right way. (Note: Don’t do what yours truly did: read the last page – unusually the last page of the novel is the last page of the book, rare these days – and get all miffed at how you think it will resolve)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked this novel because it was actually quite a straightforward narrative about complex people living through an important and complicated time in each of their lives. I could certainly identify with and see myself in all three of the main characters. There is a thought that preoccupies you when you are that age: what is my place and where should I go? And I think that gets to the heart of all three main characters, and I think the response of seeking that place to be in books and travel is certainly one I recognise, along with the process of trying to forge an identity for yourself by becoming consumed in another person. Some reader reviews have called the book pretentious but I think it’s the characters in it that are pretentious – as you are never as pretentious in life as you are between about 19 and 24 years old. If you have some nostalgia for university days passed or for your own loves lost, I’d recommend this!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Star Trek: Into Darkness - A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/star-trek-into-darkness-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2013-05-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/star-trek-into-darkness-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Into Darkness&lt;/em&gt; last night in 3D at the IMAX in Waterloo. I am going to have to separate this into a review into two parts, a review of the film and a review of the viewing experience. I am not completely happy with how the film experience is changed by the 3D and the super big screen and I will try to explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the film. I will keep this brief because I don’t really want to give up too many spoilers. I think it is pretty obvious from the trailer that this film is an amalgamation of &lt;em&gt;The Wrath Of Kahn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Search Of Spock&lt;/em&gt;, but much like the mirror universe episodes of the TV series – and because these films have spun off another strand of the Trek universe – there is a lot of fun to be had in detecting the inversions from the two classic Trek films. If you’ve never seen those old films it does not matter, the film goes into warp from the first reel and benefits greatly from squeezing the plots of two films (okay, one and a half) into one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual rules apply of in that all laws of physics are suspended in service of keeping things crunching along and most of the action sequences are effectively geared to keeping you distracted from the fact that all they are trying to do is press a button. This is my only gripe with the actual film: it tries to hard to appease the members of the audience who are not sci-fi fans. While producing crash-bang-wallop Star Trek films is great for getting your friends into the cinema with you to see it, it would be nice if there were something in the plot that had a deeper meaning or required us to stretch our imagination or get our heads around something. Perhaps we will get that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the acting, it’s really well done and shows that the casting is spot on. It was quite staggering how much like William Shatner Chris Pine looks, and the same goes for Bones, Spock and Uhura. There is less similarity with Simon Pegg as Scotty, but I cannot really imagine anyone else doing it so well and getting the scenes that are played for laughs so completely spot on. I also thought that Benedict Cumberbatch was immense as the villain John Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the 3D. For me it was a complete buzzkill. I did not get a headache or feel sick but I can imagine that some people could. My eyes did get tired though and I regularly took the glasses off and just watched the fuzzy screen for a bit to rest them. I think the cinematography required of true 3D films is so different to that required of a 2D film, that a good 2D cinematographer is not necessarily a good 3D cinematographer. Most of the 3D effects in the film struck me as just being parallax effects (when I could actually take it all in), that is layers of action sliding over each other. For the most part, it’s glassy and unreal – to the extent that a two-dimensional version would be more credible to my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that Star Trek is originally a TV show. While both of these films have done a lot to rescue the action from dingily lit rooms and plant it in exotic locations suffused in lens flare, there is still a lot of action that involves people talking to each other. In IMAX 3D these scenes mean GIANT heads looming out of the screen at you and a GIANT out of focus head just in front of you. It just doesn’t feel right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally on the 3D bitching, it seems that no one has worked out how to effectively cut from scene to scene in an effective way yet. This is actually a crucial element of film making and in 3D it looks clumsy and amateurish right now. I have no doubt that clever people will work out how to cut between scenes properly eventually – they have to if the format isn’t just going to die. In the meantime you get these horrible fades of one scene into another that take too long because they have to be careful with the depth of the 3D effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall it is a decent film that builds on the excellent casting and aesthetics of the first one, but I am not convinced that 3D adds enough to the experience to be worth it. I look forward to another Star Trek but hopefully one that’s a bit more hardcore Sci-Fi, though it’s probably a bit much to expect a reboot of &lt;em&gt;The Voyage Home&lt;/em&gt; isn’t it?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tribble count: 1 (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some great albums this month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Flaming Lips &lt;em&gt;The Terror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wire &lt;em&gt;Change Becomes Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;James Blake &lt;em&gt;Overgrown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Knife &lt;em&gt;Shaking The Habitual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-flaming-lips-the-terror&quot;&gt;The Flaming Lips &lt;em&gt;The Terror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you view &lt;em&gt;The Terror&lt;/em&gt; pretty much depends on how much you have kept up with The Flips output since their last official album, the clanking double behemoth in Merkin packaging that was &lt;em&gt;Embryonic&lt;/em&gt;. The irony being that I used &lt;em&gt;Embryonic&lt;/em&gt; to deal with a break-up and &lt;em&gt;The Terror&lt;/em&gt; is pretty much about… a break-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the sound is an evolution once more from both &lt;em&gt;Embryonic&lt;/em&gt;’s noisy CAN-style warblings and the more acid-touched atmospheres present on last year’s excellent collab-corralling collection &lt;em&gt;The Flaming Lips And Heady Fwends&lt;/em&gt;. The key track on that album was very much &lt;em&gt;I’m Working At NASA On Acid&lt;/em&gt; and its line “We trying to control… what cannot be controlled” is echoed in the line “We don’t control the controls” on &lt;em&gt;The Terror&lt;/em&gt;’s title track. If you missed &lt;em&gt;… And Heady Fwends&lt;/em&gt;, not only did you miss a treat, you’ll also not know that the band is much more synth-dependent now and that verse-chorus structures are largely out for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early interviews about the record made &lt;em&gt;The Terror&lt;/em&gt; seem like a very unapproachable and experimental record: after all, the title certainly does. However, it turns out that it’s pretty in places and a bit messy in others but generally, as ever, the sparkle outdoes the grime. There are some lovely affecting moments early on in &lt;em&gt;Be Free A Way&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Try To Explain&lt;/em&gt;, while the album’s centrepiece is &lt;em&gt;You Lust&lt;/em&gt; – a track that in edited form (it is 13 minutes long) could have sat comfortably on &lt;em&gt;Embryonic&lt;/em&gt; – and the title track. All nine tracks run into one another to form a whole suite: each track is a distillation of one aspect of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty good – as Flaming Lips albums tend to be – but it’s not the best album I’ve heard this month and I personally think that &lt;em&gt;The Flaming Lips And Heady Fwends&lt;/em&gt; is a more interesting and entertaining album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wire-change-becomes-us&quot;&gt;Wire &lt;em&gt;Change Becomes Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Wire album could actually have been their fourth: the songs that comprise it are rewrites (or touch ups) of songs that were played on an ill-fated tour after their third album &lt;em&gt;154&lt;/em&gt;. Because the bad was falling apart at that stage, the songs in question were only ever featured on a long deleted album called “Document &amp;amp; Eyewitness”, and had not seen the inside of a studio until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what songs they are! I really love &lt;em&gt;Change Becomes Us&lt;/em&gt; and would go so far as to say that it is definitely one of the best albums I have heard in the last five years. You can read back through over two years of album digest and understated classics posts on this site and you will know that I listen to a fair few!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s so great about the album? It’s hard to put my finger on. Perhaps it’s just the cerebral and elegiac tone of many of the songs, perhaps it’s the consistency throughout. It’s not uneven like &lt;em&gt;Pink Flag&lt;/em&gt;, in fact it puts me more in mind of &lt;em&gt;Chairs Missing&lt;/em&gt;, their highly underrated sophomore effort. Some punky stuff remains: &lt;em&gt;Doubles &amp;amp; Trebles&lt;/em&gt; is a secret agent echo of &lt;em&gt;Pink Flag&lt;/em&gt;’s opener &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stealth Of A Stork&lt;/em&gt; is sufficiently energetic that I hurt my back pogoing along to it the other morning (the shame of it! 3/4 of this band are twice my age!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a good portion of the album is pure pop – or at least it’s pop radio music on the planet I want to live on. There’s a beautiful yet undecipherable love song in &lt;em&gt;Re-Invent Your Second Wheel&lt;/em&gt; and a pure hit of dopamine on &lt;em&gt;Love Bends&lt;/em&gt;, whereas &lt;em&gt;B&amp;amp;W Silence&lt;/em&gt; casts a moment to remember as a black and white photograph. I could go on at length about the six song run through the middle of the album that I’ve ‘loved’ on last.fm – normally I love at most two tracks on an album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wire should be better known to everyone everywhere. The fact that they aren’t makes them an even greater pleasure to those in the know, but it does seem a shame that more people can’t enjoy them. I urge you to make this album a part of your collection, I am certain that you won’t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;james-blake-overgrown&quot;&gt;James Blake &lt;em&gt;Overgrown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Blake’s eponymous debut album really blew me away back in &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-february-2011&quot;&gt;February 2011&lt;/a&gt; but I did wonder at the time  whether my interest would be maintained over time. True enough, that album did fade into the periphery and so I wasn’t too excited at the prospect of &lt;em&gt;Overgrown&lt;/em&gt;. However, I think that he has done a good job here and that this album takes what made the first so unusual and adds in a few more conventional song tropes to make a record that feels much more tangible and interesting than that debut does now, two years on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s apparent immediately on the title track (the first and best song on the album) that there is a better match of his beatmaking skills and his beautiful voice, it’s much more soulful. Whereas previous tracks like &lt;em&gt;The Wilhelm Scream&lt;/em&gt; delighted in contorting his voice into weird shapes and others like &lt;em&gt;I Never Learned To Share&lt;/em&gt; seemed to almost goad the listener with how spartan their musical arrangements were, on &lt;em&gt;Overgrown&lt;/em&gt; everything seems more focussed on content and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly &lt;em&gt;Take A Fall For Me&lt;/em&gt; is a little wacky but it lends a sense of fun to the album, it’s certainly not as dour as &lt;em&gt;James Blake&lt;/em&gt; by any means. Then you have tracks like &lt;em&gt;Digital Lion&lt;/em&gt;, graced by the hand of Brian Eno no less, which are beautiful without the austerity and archness of previous songs like &lt;em&gt;Lindisfarne&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his debut, James Blake could have found himself with nowhere else to go but I think that &lt;em&gt;Overgrown&lt;/em&gt; proves there could be many more interesting albums to come from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-knife-shaking-the-habitual&quot;&gt;The Knife &lt;em&gt;Shaking The Habitual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have in considering this album from The Knife is one of whether it is more subversive to overtly address challenging topics using difficult material or to obliquely reference the same topics with more commercial material. In the main &lt;em&gt;Shaking The Habitual&lt;/em&gt; takes the former approach – all the issues addressed in the music are discussed upfront in the artwork, but the music within runs the gamut from genuinely compelling to pretentiously abstruse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two tracks here that last less than a minute and one that runs for almost twenty. The two miniatures &lt;em&gt;Oryx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Crake&lt;/em&gt; are fine, if a little pointless in that way that all short tracks are. I have listened to the long one &lt;em&gt;Old Dreams Waiting To Be Realized&lt;/em&gt; three times now (so that’s an hour of my life gone) and have not included it in my playlist of this month’s albums. I’m loathe to say that something is pointless, but &lt;em&gt;Old Dreams…&lt;/em&gt; is certainly not very compelling. At first I thought it might serve a purpose in the overall structure of the album, but if that’s the case I don’t think it works at all. The two halves of the album either side of this long instrumental don’t really reflect or echo one another. Unfortunately it just sounds like a band with no ideas filling up space on a CD or MP3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course elsewhere, there are plenty of good ideas all over the place. &lt;em&gt;Full Of Fire&lt;/em&gt; is likely to still be the best dance track of the year come December and it has more ideas in its nine minutes than most albums have in their whole run times. &lt;em&gt;Without You My Life Would Be Boring&lt;/em&gt; throws everything at the wall and most of it sticks, complete a gloriously beautiful/ugly vocal. &lt;em&gt;Networking&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Cherry On Top&lt;/em&gt; are both largely instrumental, one a nervy fast-paced thing and the other a slow and ominous dirge against monarchy and privilege. &lt;em&gt;A Tooth For An Eye&lt;/em&gt; is fantastic, as is &lt;em&gt;Raging Lung&lt;/em&gt;: both proof that political intelligent songs can also be songs that make you feel good and empowered. Most of the album is also littered with interesting and unique sounds and rhythms; some sound and feel like they have only ever existed in a synth or computer, while others feel like real sounds and voices trapped between this world and the digital one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to &lt;em&gt;Old Dreams…&lt;/em&gt;, the “challenging instrumental that will enrage older people who won’t get it” angle is covered again in a more satisfying way, taking the form of the creepily titled &lt;em&gt;Fracking Fluid Injection&lt;/em&gt;. If twenty minutes of a rumbling boiler room worries you, just wait until you hear this! It’s ten minutes of a sighing voice processed to sound like a squeaky gate and in keeping with its title it just sounds like the Earth having been plundered to death and giving up the ghost. It’s hideous (the reactions in the track’s shout box on last.fm are hilarious) but it’s a hell of a lot more entertaining than &lt;em&gt;Old Dreams Waiting To Be Realized&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I really like &lt;em&gt;Shaking The Habitual&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps more so than &lt;em&gt;Silent Shout&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow, In A Year&lt;/em&gt; (An opera! About Darwin! With synths!) because it takes more time to get close to it. I don’t understand it all, I don’t even like it all, but I do really admire The Knife for their approach. It is far better for a band to try something different and experimental, even if the results aren’t always compelling or fruitful. It’s not a failure or a bad album by any means because seven of the tracks here are fantastic - that’s about fifty five minutes of amazing music, the diamonds in the coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-month&quot;&gt;Next month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne, The Phoenix Foundation, and maybe Atoms For Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I Love On The Road</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/why-i-love-on-the-road"/>
   <updated>2013-04-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/why-i-love-on-the-road</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was fifteen when I first read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70401.On_the_Road&quot;&gt;“On The Road”&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kerouac&quot;&gt;Jack Kerouac&lt;/a&gt; and recently, after twice as much lifetime lived, I was able to watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337692/&quot;&gt;the film version directed by Walter Salles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars. (&lt;strong&gt;Jack Kerouac&lt;/strong&gt;, “On the Road”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to have an awesome English teacher (props to you Miss Jenner!) who indulged my interest in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.online-literature.com/periods/beat.php&quot;&gt;Beat Generation&lt;/a&gt; as it grew up, mostly from voraciously consuming information about Bomb The Bass and the inspirations for their album &lt;a href=&quot;uc14&quot;&gt;Clear&lt;/a&gt;. Up until very recently I still had her photocopied copies of Ginsberg’s Howl with me and still have to this day the memories of that first read through “On The Road”. Not to mention the strains of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/music/10,000+Maniacs/_/Hey+Jack+Kerouac&quot;&gt;10,000 Maniacs’ “Hey Jack Kerouac”&lt;/a&gt;, their album leant to me by the history teacher (props to you Mr Armstrong!) who also provided his copy of “Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas” (viz, &lt;a href=&quot;gonzo-a-graphic-biography-of-hunter-s-thompson&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;). Yes, it does appear that I went to the most amazing school ever - even if I did not realise it at the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embarrassingly I still have memories of the night on my MSc at York seven years later when, having fallen in with “serious literary types” (i.e. someone who had written a short story once) I proceeded to drink two bottles of red wine, read aloud from “On The Road” in my best hipster voice, and then puked all over the kitchen table. Not my finest hour. Many pages of my copy of the novel are enlivened by flecks of red wine from that evening and I keep it as a reminder of the follies of overindulgence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some spoilers in what follows but I’ll try to describe the plot in broad strokes. The novel is really a description of a series of experiences, those of being on the road. As such there is not too much of a plot to spoil. The film admirably tries to take this approach too but there’s obviously only so much they can show and so describing what happens may have more of a spoiling effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-is-a-timeless-tale&quot;&gt;It is a timeless tale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On The Road” is perhaps as much part of the mythology of America as the founding fathers, the war of independence, and the civil war. It is told in the first person and is basically autobiographical, telling the story of Sal Paradise (a cipher for Jack Kerouac) and his adventures on the road after the publication of his first novel “The Town And The City”. Most of Sal’s travels fixate on Dean Moriarty (in real life a Beat author named Neal Cassady) and also include Carlo Marx (a fictionalisation of Allen Ginsberg, perhaps the most important of the Beat writers after Kerouac) and Old Bull Lee (William S. Burroughs, the film of whose novel “The Naked Lunch” has already been discussed on this blog (about a year back as it happens).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the events take place in the late 40s and early 50s for a generation of young men that came of age immediately after the war. Despite the aftermath of a world war, at that point it must have seemed as the American dream were very much a real thing: the war was won and American industry was now converting back to providing peace time goods. The seismic shocks of Elvis Presley, the civil rights movement, and Vietnam were all still years ahead. It was the short breath between the war and America’s own golden age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, as part of a generation disconnected from its past and seemingly facing an uncertain part in their country’s future, “On The Road” ends up not being about very much in particular other than its generation’s own rootlessness. This is expressed as a travelogue  that borders on hagiography, almost as a way of convincing the participants of their place and worth. Nothing much happens: they travel back and forth across the states, there are parties and women and drugs. There are cars and there is jazz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-existence-is-as-much-the-story-as-the-novel&quot;&gt;Its existence is as much the story as the novel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time fifties were over Jack Kerouac, eager to write a follow up to “The Town And The City” sat down to write his memories of being on the road. He typed the whole novel on to a single scroll of paper and aimed to write in as immediate and spontaneous a way as possible. Sentences roll over one another and burst at the seams with excitable descriptions of even the more banal episodes that occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s good, it is amazing. When it isn’t, well let’s say that Truman Capote was partly correct when he famously said of “On The Road”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s not writing, that’s just typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the good outweighs the bad and I like the formlessness of the plot, it means that I can pick it up, flick to any page, and usually find an episode worth reading for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-thoughts-on-the-movie&quot;&gt;Some thoughts on the movie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the film much more than I thought I would. I don’t like long films and the fact that it ran for over two hours, added to the loose plot of the book, would lead to a movie that went on forever and made no sense. As it turned out, the screenwriters did a pretty good job of condensing the novel into a movie that’s almost as good as Salles’ previous “The Motorcycle Diaries”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked Sam Reilly and Garret Hedlund in their roles as Sal and Dean. Meanwhile I wasn’t that convinced by Kristen Stewart as Marylou, I just kept seeing how much she seemed to be enjoying not being in a Twilight movie for a change. Kirsten Dunst is usually good value whatever she happens to be in and she is fine form here as the steely Camille.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film did a good job of reminding me about episodes in the book that I had forgotten. It missed out the bit with Sal alone in Times Square, which was one of my favourite bits in the book. Some of the film suffers from not having Sal’s commentary on what happens but in general this is done with some good use of voiceover. I think the film heightens the discord that exists between Sal and Dean by the end of the novel for dramatic effect, whereas the book explores the notion that both guys are different sides of the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, March 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-march-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-march-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just the David Bowie album this month as it’s pretty much the only new music that I’ve listened to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I had no idea what to expect of “The Next Day”. It comes almost exactly ten years after “Reality”, an album that I have never really got into despite it having some pretty decent fun tracks like “New Killer Star” and a nice cover of “Pablo Picasso” that has never sent me in search of Jonathan Richman’s original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite Bowie album is probably either “Heroes” or “1. Outside”, and “The Next Day” captures the feel of both these albums very much to my delight. The first single “Where Are We Now?” indicated melancholy introspection but in fact it’s only one of two such songs, the rest are uptempo and curiously engaged with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think given the circumstances of how everyone thought he had retired, the gloomy and death-obsessed outlook of many of the songs here is to be expected. I like how the album sets off immediately and pulls no punches with the title track, the chorus being: “And the next day / and the next / and another day” delivered with all the venom you’d expect from the world’s sweetheart all grown-up and old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some weaker songs (like “Boss Of Me” and “(You Will) Set The World On Fire”) but it’s a very good return on a 14 song record. For the first week or so, I’d listen to it and find I’d forgotten one of the songs and find that that song was brilliant. With ten years between albums you might expect him to have saved up a few gems though. Nevertheless he’s written some songs here that deserved to be considered among his very best, not least “Love Is Lost”, “How Does The Grass Grow?” and “Heat”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Iain M. Banks, Consider Phlebas</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/consider-phlebas-a-picaresque-in-space"/>
   <updated>2013-03-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/consider-phlebas-a-picaresque-in-space</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back, I decided I was going to write about the Iain M. Banks sci-fi-novels (mainly as a respite from having to read and write about &lt;a href=&quot;j-g-ballard&quot;&gt;J. G. Ballard novels&lt;/a&gt;, but I only got as fas as writing about the excellent “Against A Dark Barkground” and re-reading the first of the Culture novels “Consider Phlebas”. WARNING: Some plot spoilers follow (but not too many).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why it has taken almost two years to write about this novel. Perhaps it is because I couldn’t find myself a proper explanation for the title. The following is my own theory, feel free to add your own in the comments. The book takes its name from the epigraph, an extract from T.S. Elliot’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html&quot;&gt;“The Waste Land”&lt;/a&gt; (which is also on my “to read” list):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gentile or Jew. 
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,&lt;br /&gt;
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best explanation I can come up with is the fact that the main character, Horza, is a being that can gradually take the form of other people. He’s a member of a nearly extinct and persecuted race. The analogues of Gentiles and Jews here are the Idirans and the Culture. The Culture are a kind of superhumanity – all wisecracking and cool, masters of technology (or mastered by it - but that’s for the discussion of a later novel in the series) and taking about existence in a fortune cookie way. They aren’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; humans but they are described with human physiology as a baseline. The Culture feature in most of the Iain M. Banks novels and they are well loved by readers for a reason, he even shoehorns a reason why they aren’t involved in “Against A Dark Background”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Idirans are massive jerks. Literally massive and figuratively jerks, they are three metres tall, have three legs and are exceptionally belligerent. “Consider Phlebas” takes place with a one-sided war happening between the Idirans and the Culture - well technologically one-sided that is. There is a suspicion that the war is one-sided in another way too, that the Culture are somehow are above fighting and are simply enduring ‘gigadeaths’ until the Idirans exhaust themselves. As soon as the Culture builds war ships, the war is pretty much over and the Idiran Empire is annihilated. The war itself is in the background for much of the novel with a potted history given in an appendix at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of “Consider Phlebas” is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque_novel&quot;&gt;picaresque&lt;/a&gt; centred on Horza – an episodic shamble across the galaxy in search of a Mind (An artificial intelligence designed for the first of the warships mentioned above.) that has been lost on a ‘world of the dead’ called Schar’s World. Schar’s World is a world belonging to a civilisation that wiped itself out with nuclear weapons. Essentially a monument to the folly of war, it is monitored by a race of beings that will not allow the Culture access and so Horza, who in a former life was a member of an ill-fated expedition to Schar’s World, is approached by the Culture to retrieve the mind. Of course, the Idirans want to recover it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to look up the formal definition of picaresque for this post in order to confirm my intuition that “Consider Phlebas” could be considered as one. A picaresque is a form of novel that emerged in Spain in the 16th century and became incredibly popular throughout the rest of Western Europe in the centuries that followed (can you tell I’ve cribbed all that from wikipedia?!). Such novels feature a shambling rogue who shambles through a number of disconnected adventures without much personal development. There is usually a strong satirical element involved, as there is here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall not deprive you of the pleasures of enjoying Horza’s adventures as he inexorably meets his destiny on Schaar’s World, that would involve far too many juicy spoilers. They are by turns comic, thrilling and horrific. I remember reading the novel on my holidays after my GCSEs in 1996, sitting in the sunshine agog at these adventures in outer space. Half a lifetime later, it lost a little of its sparkle but it’s still a ripsnorter of story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what of satire? Well all the novels that feature the Culture are in essence a meditation on either whether it should exist or on what means and methods are necessary for it to maintain said existence. Usually both. Written long before the so-called “war on terror” it nevertheless manages to satirise it excellently, though perhaps the focus at the time was reds and blues. I like this, I think that good science fiction &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; say something about the world we live in, so that our escapism might also teach us something about what we are escaping from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will leave it there for now as I am already touching on themes that will emerge and recur in any discussion of the next two books: “The Player Of Games” and the incomparably chilling “Use Of Weapons” (and the others too). It might be a while before I have time to write about them, so I will take the opportunity to heartily endorse both of them now (and of course “Consider Phlebas” too…)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #22: Walking With Thee by Clinic</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-22"/>
   <updated>2013-03-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-22</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Walking With Thee” is the second album by Liverpool band &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic_(band)&quot;&gt;Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. It was released in 2002, which seems like an age ago now. Even longer ago they released the single “The Return of Evil Bill”, which was got me interested in them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got back into “Walking With Thee” when I picked “Vulture” in my A-Z of Animals playlist last month. I’d forgotten just how great a song it is, both musically and lyrically. It’s a caution against letting those with more power and wealth lord it over us – viz, “the best that you’ve left here for others / is the best the rest of us know” – and so it’s surely much more a song for these times than back then in 2002. Anyway, I’m going to avoid too much reading into the lyrics for this particular understated classic, as most of the time Clinic are defiantly resistant to that kind of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often champion bands that have a distinctive sound who then produce an album that is cohesive and all of their own sound. This is perhaps shorthand for saying that the songs on “Walking With Thee” “all sound the same”, but I’m really not trying to damn the album with faint praise. It’s had enough of that already and by rights, I should be fawning over their debut album “Internal Wrangler” if mainstream critical opinion is anything to go by. Now, “Internal Wrangler” is a fine album but it’s telling that when I looked in my iTunes for it I found that I’d never converted it to MP3! Sacrilege!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Clinic have been accused of repeating their sound throughout their career which now spans 13 years and six or seven albums. Certainly the follow-up to “Walking With Thee”, the charmingly-titled “Winchester Cathedral”, sounds pretty much like a facsimile and I’ve only recently started listening to their new material again – the fabulous “Free Reign II” might appear in this month’s album digest if I can stop listening to David Bowie long enough to take in any other albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;amp;site=&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1680&amp;amp;bih=969&amp;amp;q=mondrian&amp;amp;oq=mondrian&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.1475.3523.0.3801.8.7.0.1.1.0.191.857.3j4.7.0...0.0...1ac.1.5.img.XCiIolIg9uI&quot;&gt;Mondrian&lt;/a&gt;-referencing cover art, you can get lost in patches of “Walking With Thee” and only realise mid-song that another has started. Well, if you’re listening to it without paying too much attention. It’s one of those great albums to listen to on the tube (I must compile some sort of list!) as it rewards zoning out as much as it does zoning in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underpinning structure of the songs is generally Ade Blackburn’s voice and the booming drums that bounce through the majority of the upbeat tracks. At times, generally when he sings lower, they sound like Pixies (the band rather than the mythical creatures) and at others they sound like no one else, particularly on the slower songs when that high reedy voice contorts them into sinister and otherworldly shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few listens, you notice that the riffs and the melodies are doing as much to propel and colour the songs as the lyrics are. This is good because they are easier to fix on than the lyrics as both rush by in a blur. I’d put “Walking With Thee” (along with “Internal Wrangler” and, for the most part, “Winchester Cathedral”) down as album(s) that are as interesting musically as lyrically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty to jump and sing along to. I don’t subscribe to the view that many of Clinic’s songs are sinister and I was disappointed when I saw them live that not more of the room wasn’t bopping along. Mind you, their habit of performing in scrubs and surgical masks does lend sufficient surreality to proceedings that perhaps me fellow gig-goers were a little too unnerved to dance along. Throughout there are melodicas and clarinets and saxophones to complement the more traditional electric guitars (tuned, mostly, to surf mode), bass guitars and synths. There is a house-y feel to the intro to “Come Into Our Room”, almost comically so, whilst “Pet Eunuch” thrashes around in a delightfully punky way. Meanwhile the pace relents on occasion for “Mr. Moonlight”, though I’d say that either “Internal Wrangler”’s “Earth Angel” or “Goodnight Georgie” would probably win any contest to decide the best Clinic slowie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last song “Walking With Thee” is the delightfully sinister “For The Wars”. I’ve realised in recent weeks that I’m quite in love with its singsong lullaby and its morbid undertones. It regularly makes my private playlists and it is perfect for those times when you need to see the shadows on a sunny morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could write loads more about that one song, let alone the whole album. The opposites present throughout (sunlight vs moonlight, rooms vs bridges, slow vs fast etc) and so on, the significance of the bridge and that of the vulture and whatnot. But I’ll let you do that dear reader because if you do go dig this one out, I’m pretty sure you’ll be glad that you did.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Work Of Art At The End Of My Road?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-work-of-art-at-the-end-of-my-road"/>
   <updated>2013-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-work-of-art-at-the-end-of-my-road</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have had a lot of ideas for posts swirling around in my head in recent days. This is because I have actually done quite a lot of cool things in that time, and because I have hung out with some great people who make me think, and because I always have a whole load of things bouncing around in there anyway - space junk of the mind. I was thinking about how to put together these thoughts I have been having about art and about stories and yes, about love too. It all kind of got muddled up and then I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “give way” sign at the end of my road was flashing and at the same time &lt;a href=&quot;http://uw09.unseenworlds.net/track/appalachian-grove-iii&quot;&gt;Laurie Spiegel’s “Appalachian Grove III”&lt;/a&gt; was playing on my iPhone. I was listening to it today because I was on the underground and it’s the only thing I had downloaded to my phone. When I say that the sign was flashing, I mean the light that illuminates it by night of course. And as it blinked away with the last entrails of daylight smeared across the horizon behind, a fitful and needless light that sparked in and out of time with the gated sounds of the Spiegel piece, I felt a great sense of joy in seeing everything I wanted to write about there in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So was it art? A chance happening of a fitful faulty light flashing in the twilight with an observer who had just the right music playing in his ears at the time? Perhaps. It can’t be preserved now (I thought about getting the phone out and shooting a video but that wouldn’t have had the music; it might also have meant stopping the music too) except as my anecdote to you now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday night, I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/bigger-splash-painting-after-performance&quot;&gt;“A Bigger Splash”&lt;/a&gt; the exhibition at the Tate Modern about how painting has changed under the influence of performance art. In fine company I was able to look at and think about some very strange pieces that I perhaps would not have considered for too long otherwise,  due to both the exhibition and my thoughtful companion - I think I would have rushed it had I been alone. I’d recommend it on the caveat that it is rather wonky in places, but it’s fine if you take it in good humour. It does get a little tiring towards the end, the rooms dedicated to explaining ideas using multiple artists are much better than the ones dedicated to a single artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish I shall tell you what happened next. I eventually walked away from the scene, grinning like a loon. As I got to almost-home the track changed and I looked back: the give way sign glowed back at me and did not flicker for an instant. It seemed darker now. Different music and different light: a different world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, February 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most Februaries are quite quiet when it comes to albums (though this was not the case &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-february-2011&quot;&gt;back in 2011&lt;/a&gt;) and although only the Foals album is a major release, I was quite surprised to find myself with four decent albums to write about. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Darkstar “News From Nowhere”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foals “Holy Fire”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Daniel Hope “Spheres”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apparat “Krieg und Frieden (Music For Theatre)”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;darkstar-news-from-nowhere&quot;&gt;Darkstar “News From Nowhere”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to give too much biographical background for the Darkstar album as I don’t know too much about who the are. I saw this album and its lovely artwork in an e-mail from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bleep.com/&quot;&gt;bleep.com&lt;/a&gt;. Because it was on Spotify, I gave it a go. At first I wasn’t too impressed but over repeated listens, it has become my favourite album of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overriding sound of the album is pastoral, though its sound is also quite digital: all skittering beats, processed vocals, and interesting synth sounds. Opening track “Light Body Clock Starter” weirdly lives up to its title, the aural equivalent of one of those alarm clocks that wakes you up gently by filling your room with light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing the theme, the next song “Timeaway” is built around a clockwork music box beat while breathy vocals coo soothingly over the top. On the first two tracks the only words I can make out are “wake me up” at the start of “Light Body Clock Starter”. The mechanical clocklike vibe continues on “Armonica” (and so does the lyrical theme: “I sleep until I’m told”) and though the vocals continue to be heavily processed, it’s easier to make them out. About halfway through, everything bubbles down into some wonderful and delicate noise, then sure enough the beat kicks back in but only briefly. It’s a lovely moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two tracks are the centrepiece of the album to my ears. The anonymously titled “-“ comes off like a collab between Doves and “Assassin”-era The Orb - a great combination as far as I am concerned - and “A Day’s Pay For A Day’s Work”, a beautiful song with Beach Boys style harmonies and perhaps the least electronic arrangement on the whole album. It’s a sad but beautiful song, lyrics like “I never get so much for losing touch” hint at the sadness of being away from the ones you love (or perhaps the sadness of abandoning one’s dreams for the world of work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those five tracks and the more anonymous “Young Heart’s” go by in just over twenty minutes. I’m always saying how much I like short albums and it’s certainly the case that less is more here. The rest of the album is a bit more expansive: “Amplified Ease” is a (welcome) reanimation of the much missed Beta Band and the final three tracks are dense and largely instrumental. These three are the longest tracks on the album and tick away through their ambient prettiness very nicely indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: I still don’t have a clue who they are, but “News From Nowhere” is a fantastic little album once you take the time to examine its nooks and crannies. It touches on several early naughties touchstones, while also ticking and burbling away like a record that could only have been made in 2013. Try it, I think you’ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foals-holy-fire&quot;&gt;Foals “Holy Fire”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unnaturally excited for “Holy Fire” when I found out that it was coming but I think I’ve been undone by my immense love for their last album “Total Love Forever”, which shocked me back in 2009 by being about six squillion times better than their debut “Antidotes” would have had me believe was possible. That’s not to say that “Antidotes” isn’t a fine album, it’s just that at the time it seemed a little one dimensional… their subsequent albums have somehow managed to make it sound better while being better albums themselves. What can I say? Foals are an odd band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Holy Fire” isn’t quite as good as “Total Love Forever”, though like “News From Nowhere” it’s an album that I am warming to more as I repeatedly listen to it. The good news is that their facility at writing pop songs is undiminished: “Inhaler” and “My Number” (2013’s best pop song so far) are as good as “Blue Blood” (not really a pop song), “Balloons”, and “Mathletics”. More importantly I think they probably have a wider appeal than their earlier songs. Be sure to check out the Hot Chip remix of “My Number” too, it’s a real ear worm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also good news is that some of their attempts to expand their sound work really well: the opening instrumental “Prelude” is great fun and sounds like something off CAN’s &lt;a href=&quot;can-the-lost-tapes&quot;&gt;“Lost Tapes” box set&lt;/a&gt;, “Bad Habit” intelligently takes their sound and builds in tropes from dance music, while the closing track “Moon” has some great eerie synth noises that would grace the fx track of a sci-fi flick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the other positive aspect of “Holy Fire”, we have to first discuss the bad news:  “Holy Fire” is a break-up album. Ouch. It could be worse, it could have been about how shit it is to always be on tour. To be fair only “Late Night” really pushes this aspect of the album too far (oh and “Stepson”, which wins the dubious accolade of worst Foals song ever) with its morose leanings. Other songs like “My Number” and “Bad Habit” deal with it maturely (sadly miles now from the exuberant lovestruck joy of “Miami” and “Total Love Forever” though), while the songs about coming out the other side are pretty good: “Out Of The Woods” may have a gauchely obvious title but it’s a beautiful slight song about feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: I like this album a lot and there are definitely outstanding songs here but the “evolution not revolution” approach and the sometimes dreary subject matter mean that it’s not as sparkling a success as “Total Love Forever”. Still looking forward to the next one though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary II: Does the horse meat scandal mean that there has never been a better time to be a band called Foals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;daniel-hope-spheres&quot;&gt;Daniel Hope “Spheres”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know you are getting old when you buy a classical album and one of the composers was born after you were. In fact, you know you are getting old when you buy a classical album full stop. Daniel Hope definitely looks on the cover here like a guy with a violin who your gran might like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought into “Spheres” because there’s a theme: pieces that are related to the concept of “music of the spheres”. This is the same thing that motivated Kepler’s Harmony Of The Worlds, the piece by Laurie Spiegel that is on the Voyager golden record. The great thing about that piece, performed by an antique computer, is that it is a really screechy avant-garde piece that you feel should have no connection to violin pieces performed by dashing chaps that your gran might like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly there’s no screechiness here and despite the youth of the composers involved (born in 1983?!?!?! WTF?!?) there isn’t much that is avant-garde either, though the piece by Prokofiev isn’t by &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Prokofiev and is pretty screechy. Instead we get blissed out renditions of “I giorni” by Einaudi (it is, admittedly, very nice) and there’s also a remarkably beautiful piece called “Lento” by Aleksey Igudesman (who I will be investigating further). The Michael Nyman piece (from the soundtrack to “Drowning By Numbers”) is also pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that had piqued my interest was the Glass piece but this doesn’t seem as fun in isolation in between pieces by other composers, as Einstein On The Beach or Akhnahten are when spread out as a whole over a longer time span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: Your gran might like him. It’s all beautifully played but I think I prefer classical music to be all by one composer and not this kind of greatest hits approach. I consider this to be part of my musical education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apparat-krieg-und-frieden-music-for-theatre&quot;&gt;Apparat “Krieg und Frieden (Music For Theatre)”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy to leave it at three albums this month, but then I came across this new one by Apparat. Listening on iTunes preview my housemate said “that sounds sad” but it was too late, I was already captivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a full album by Apparat, at least not one as complete as “Walls”, which is the other of his that I own. Instead it’s a soundtrack to a theatre play, presumably an adaptation of “War And Peace” if my use of Google translate is to be believed. As such, the album is comprised of tracks that are very soundtrack like and alternate versions that I guess are later rewordings of the same material for fun. For example the opening track “44” (the piece that my housemate called sad) is followed up by “44 (Noise Version)” in which all the original’s strings are torn away and the track retooled as a ringing wall of noise that Tim Hecker or Fennesz would be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes for a very good night time listen and it has quite the success rate in making me fall asleep, &lt;a href=&quot;uc21&quot;&gt;which, as I’ve said before, is a good thing&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not all drone lullabies and sad strings though, there are a couple of songs throughout that are simpler than those on “Walls” (i.e. just a repeated phrase over the music, like “Lighton”) but are no worse for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: Apparat released an album called “The Devil’s Walk” back in 2011 that I missed because I had too much else to listen to at the time. “Krieg und Frieden” has convinced me that I shall have to go back and check it out at some point, even if this album is a deliberate exercise in the more atmospheric aspects of his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-month&quot;&gt;Next month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMFG there’s only a first ruddy album in ten years by David Bowie! Swoon!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Pynchon</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/on-pynchon"/>
   <updated>2013-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/on-pynchon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The existence, or impending existence, of a new novel by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon&quot;&gt;Thomas Pynchon&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/pynchon-takes-on-silicon-alley/&quot;&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. I have all his previous books (seven written over a period of about fifty years, a pace that I definitely approve of), though he’s a hard author to get close to: I’ve only finished three and started four up till now. The unfinished one is, of course, Gravity’s Rainbow (GR) and somewhat perversely, I have two copies of the thing. Of the three unstarted, both Mason &amp;amp; Dixon (MD) and Against The Day (ATD) seem too dense and intimidating, while Vineland just begs me to read The Crying Of Lot 49 (L49) or Inherent Vice (IV) one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no coincidence that I began reading (and acquiring unread) Pynchon novels slap bang in the middle of trying to write my PhD thesis. It was just the right to be unsettled by books that strip away the world around you and replace the things you thought you knew with uncertainties, paranoid conspiracies, and deranged alternatives. It was just the time to experience the reader’s equivalent of vertigo – my initial comparison was to sea sickness but no part of that experience is as enjoyable as these novels – and to get shaken up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V remains my favourite. In many ways I think the plot of V is as follows (spoilers ahead, but not really): you are reading a novel called V, it jumps around in time a bit, and the people involved and the events that occur might be related to one another. Might. I think that there’s no sense in mentioning Cairo, or art thefts, or alligators, or genocide, or anything else because you, the reader, are the engine that puts it all together in the end. You the reader, hold V out in front of you – the shape of the letter is the shape of the book in your hands (though not with an eReader) and you are the connection between the plot lines that diverge away from you (or, if you like, that converge within you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s what reading Pynchon does to you: sets up crazy ideas in your head and lets you run with them. Every single one of his books stirs in something from outside the book and sets the book at the heart of some other weird universe that tangentially intersects with our own – the concept of alternate reality begins in Pynchon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other writers that I love don’t have this looseness in their writing. Murakami appears to be random on first reading but once you have read a few, the symbols and codes are there for you to see – this is meta-textuality by canon rather than Pynchon’s oddness. Ballard always straightjackets his plots: form follows function and the function is to be one single (usually deranged or cynical) point – always a bullet for a specific gun. Meanwhile, Cormac McCarthy – the author to whom I ran when Pynchon got a bit too much to handle – is as direct as Pynchon is obtuse: something as intense as Blood Meridian makes for an interesting counterpoint to L49. I have not come across any other author remotely like him, his writing is truly unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason it has taken so long – until today’s announcement – to bash out a post about Pynchon is GR: it’s the elephant in the room. I’ve taken it on about five times now and have only managed part one – even if that alone is more than most novels in itself. It’s composed of twenty one subsections that apparently correspond to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychicguild.com/tarot_major.php&quot;&gt;major arcana of a Tarot deck&lt;/a&gt; (the tower, the hanged man, death, etc) but I can’t seem to divine any meaning from it. I don’t even know for certain if the “cards” are in “order”, or whether they are randomised and represent a “reading” of sorts. The section that corresponds to “The Lovers” seems to be in the correct place but none of the others sections seem to correspond obviously to their card, perhaps it is a game of textual analysis that is beyond me despite my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GR gives me trouble because I can’t let the writing just flow over me and I think that in order to get anywhere you have to. If you try to latch on to all the peripheral characters or subplots or trifling concepts like meaning and plot and structure, you get snagged – and all the fibres you have knitted together get frayed. I always have to stop with GR, I get disheartened and put off by it coming apart at the seams in the way that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had more success with other dense interconnected novels in the past though. Take Nicola Barker’s Darkmans – this also stretches out multiple characters and weird happenings and seemingly incongruous plot points (such as weird islamic cults, medieval jesters, antique roof tiles and the Romney, Hythe &amp;amp; Dimchurch miniature railway) – but tellingly the author cannot resist the temptation to draw it all back in. It helps that Barker’s writing has a clear voice that commands you to read on, perhaps one developed in response to dissatisfaction with other postmodern writers, but with GR all you get are occasional pronouncements (usually “you’re going the wrong way!”) in between bursts of static. This might sound rather daunting but the challenge is rather entertaining and in fact the way that Darkmans suffers by (admittedly inappropriate) comparison with GR is that it feels like a bit of a cheat when things get tied off nicely rather than being left frayed and open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma remains one of whether I should finish GR (well actually whether I should start again) or just give up. The trouble is, I know it is good and I know that it will be worth it. Besides, if someone can read it all and then post about 5000  words on the internet about how much they hated it (boy I wish I still had that link to share with you!), then it must be worth getting through one way or the other. Also I’m morbidly fascinated about the giant octopus scene I’ve heard so much about…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Pynchon’s novels are what Proust would have written had he grazed idly across Wikipedia on his lunch break instead of contemplating Madelines (Full disclosure: I have not yet read a jot of Proust but intend to, eventually) or perhaps Pynchon’s writing and plots are the equivalent of Melville’s exhaustive exposition of whaling minutiae, but writ across the whole breadth of the twentieth and twenty-first century experience. Or perhaps, after everything, Pynchon is Pynchon, and an eighth novel to add to the canon is indeed cause for celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tl-dr&quot;&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Pynchon is a novelist whose output consists of a few, weighty yet important works including V, the Crying Of Lot 49 and Gravity’s Rainbow. He’s not prolific and today his eighth novel Bleeding Edge was announced and is scheduled to be released in July this year, 50 years after his first. I am really excited by this.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Jigsaw</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-jigsaw"/>
   <updated>2013-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-jigsaw</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other weekend, beset by insomnia, I decided to follow &lt;a href=&quot;five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep&quot;&gt;my own advice&lt;/a&gt; and get up to do something instead of wallowing unable to sleep. I pulled my emergency jigsaw out of the cupboard and set to it. I should stress that I mean a jigsaw puzzle and not an actually jigsaw: DIY at 2am is not such a good idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d forgotten how interesting jigsaw puzzles actually are. As I sat there contemplating the 1000 pieces and wondered exactly what I’d let myself in for, I found myself thinking about a number of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the jigsaw puzzle as a problem in itself. The fact that you have to reconstruct the picture on the box, but of course the version in the puzzle is much larger. At the start I would pull out pieces that looked like nothing in the entire photo I was working to. For starters I was picking up all these blue pieces and unlike most puzzles this one had no sky and nothing else that was blue either. Naturally these guys went on their own pile and pieces that were entirely coloured in more obvious greens (the trees in the background) and blacks (the locomotive… Spoiler: the locomotive was also ‘blue’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hit me early on that straight lines are a pretty good ally in solving a puzzle too. And not just the edges. I guess it’s pretty obvious that there would be lots of lines in a picture of a locomotive on a track, but there were also the details on the engine and the coaches and the canopy of the station etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so as I hunted for lines and brickwork and other such stuff I became absorbed in the other pleasing aspect of late night jigsaw puzzling: taking a big problem and breaking it down into smaller, more solvable ones. It’s not a station, it’s a canopy and then a platform. It’s not a coach, it’s a set of windows and then a door. And so on. Perhaps it is this that makes these puzzles so suitable for the insomniac!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end it took quite a few days. The picture is as far as I got because the trees were going to be an absolute nightmare. By then the calmness I’d sought had been won and the engine was looking fine. Choo choo!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, January 2013</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2013"/>
   <updated>2013-01-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Only one of this month three albums was actually released this month. Nelly Furtado’s Mi plan was actually released over three years ago - I only discovered it last year when I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-september-2012&quot;&gt;the September album digest&lt;/a&gt; following the release of “The Spirit Indestructible”, or it might have been when I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;uc20&quot;&gt;“Folklore”&lt;/a&gt; at around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I guess these are albums that I bought with my Christmas gift vouchers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;everything-everything-arc&quot;&gt;Everything Everything “Arc”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I had better start with albums actually released this month. Before listening listening to the iTunes previews of Arc I’d not heard anything anything by Everything Everything (pun is author’s own!) but I was quite impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much is made in reviews of their glitchy sounds and hyperactive cut-up songs, but to my mind “Arc” doesn’t sound too different to the second Longpigs album “Mobile Home”. This was the album that did for the Longpigs as a band, leaving us with Richard Hawley’s solo career and “On and On” at funerals. However “Arc” does sound bang up to date. More importantly they sound like a band in command of their sound rather than one that is falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that hyperactivity is the sound of ideas jostling with one another. It’s infectious too; the first time I listened all the way through, I came up with about five ideas for song lyrics of my own (and I have written any lyrics for going on ten years now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wish the lead singer didn’t sing so high (as said every reviewer my age when they heard “The Bends” by Radiohead) because I think there are moments where he sounds more comfortable and more expressive singing lower. I guess they will figure that out in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should point out some highlights. For me the best tune is the opening track “Cough Cough” and I think it’s the most successful of the songs here that are experiments. Elsewhere, gluing songs together so that they end in the middle just as they begin is a bit like turning the Mona Lisa into a Mobius strip: it doesn’t really add to the picture and it looks amateurish when you can see the join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also great is “Undrowned”, which I’d say is a little less experimental that instead relies on a sing-song tune and sinister wordplay in the lyrics. It’s like the world’s most malevolent nursery rhyme. I can just picture it now in a songtage at the end of a gritty crime drama set on a council estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall “Arc” is an album that’s fun and is over quickly. Some of the ideas go places, others don’t. That’s great, because next time out we either get to hear a band hitting their stride (like Foals on their second album) or reinventing to develop some consistency (think of something like “Skying” by The Horrors). A pretty good January album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;frank-ocean-channel-orange&quot;&gt;Frank Ocean “channel ORANGE”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine whose taste I trust without reservation recommended Frank Ocean’s previous album (“Nostalgia Ultra”) to me a while back. On that occasion I decided to exercise a reservation despite my friend’s great taste because I didn’t approve of Odd Future’s distasteful lyrics (and still don’t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on though, I came across the video to “Swim Good”, which is an amazing song. In fact, I’m going to embed it right here, right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See? Amazing. So I took advantage of “channel ORANGE” being sold for peanuts on the iTunes Store over Christmas and have really enjoyed it. The album seems to mostly be about unrequited love (ah, something I can relate to) and drugs (…and something I can’t…). Let’s just say that “Thinking Bout You” kind of resonates with me. I’m not sure I’ve ever felt quite as bad as he purports to on the excellent and devastating “Bad Religion” but I think I get the sentiment on “Pilot Jones” (I’m not sure though, I might be too square to properly appreciate the lyrics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere there are songs that are really interesting from a musical point of view too. (Talented songwriter in musically interesting shock!) Probably the best track in this regard is “Pyramid”, something this ambitious is rarely seen on a pop album. It juxtaposes two tales over ten minutes, one in ancient Egypt and another in modern America, so it’s great lyrically - but the musical flourishes interest me more: the trance breakdown, the vocoders, and perhaps most surprisingly, the Led Zeppelin-esque guitar solo at the end. There are lots of little musical and sample-based interludes like “White” too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really like “Super Rich Kids”, which has just the right amount of pathos to cut with its satire of… well… super rich kids. The lyrics go from arrogance “A million one, a million two / A hundred more will never do” to despair “I end my day upon the roof / I say I’ll jump, I never do” (another line that resonates). Talking of great lines, “Why see the world when you’ve got the beach?” from “Sweet Life” is similarly excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My absolute favourite though is “Pink Matter”, which reminds me how much I’ve missed Andre 3000. Again the song itself is a combination of a great lyric with a spooky spare arrangement that manages to underpin things in a simple, sexy and unfussy way. And all that business about the nature of thought in the lines “What do you think my brain is made for? / Is it just a container for the mind? / This great grey matter” echoes a lot of the thoughts I’ve been having lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nelly-furtado-mi-plan&quot;&gt;Nelly Furtado “Mi Plan”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth checking the reviews of this album out on iTunes, particularly the ones from boneheads who think she’s insulted them in some way by having the audacity to record an album in Spanish. It’s hilarious (but also really disappointing) that people feel threatened by foreign languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, although the songs on “Mi Plan” are pretty good and quite fun, they do seem rather conservative. Now I’m not saying that I expected a Spanish language Nelly Furtado album to be a hip-hop concept album about the life and work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo&quot;&gt;Frida Kahlo&lt;/a&gt;, but “Mi Plan” doesn’t have the sparkle and sass of “Loose”. I would have thought it might have the vibrancy of “Whoah Nelly” but not really, there’s more duets than I expected with guys who sound much older than her. It’s all a little… stiff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I do really enjoy songs like “Manos Al Aire”, “Bajo Otra Luz” and “Fantasmas”. What’s more, I like to shuffle all Nelly’s songs on my phone and any of these  songs are a fine contribution when they come up (even if there’s some weird sounding dude warbling on them too).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, December 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-december-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-december-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three albums (one very Christmassey one!) and an EP this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tracey Thorn “Tinsel and Lights”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Woob “Have Landed”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin “Instrumental Tourist”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Burial “Truant / Rough Sleeper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracey-thorn-tinsel-and-lights&quot;&gt;Tracey Thorn “Tinsel and Lights”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tinsel and Lights” is that rarest of records, a Christmas record that is perfectly suited to the season and is not in any way overbearing or irritating. Most albums that are Christmas themed are usually centred on lots of covers that are taken from a small subset of well worn classics. The songs on “Tinsel And Lights” are either originals or slightly more obscure covers and this works to its great advantage. The most famous song here (“Have yourself a merry little Christmas” aside) is probably the White Stripes’ “In The Cold Cold Night” and that’s not really a Christmas song (though it works better here than I’d anticipated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tone throughout is quiet and intimate, an antidote to the gaudier chintzier Christmas fare that abounds at this time of year. The tone is pretty melancholy, but not to the point of being miserable. Opener “Joy” gets right to the heart of why Christmas works even for the most irreligious of people (including myself): “you loved it as a kid / and now you need it more than you ever did / because of the dark / we see the beauty in the spark” and “Like A Snowman” hits a sweet sad note about a relationship that’s melting away: “give me your love or something / knowing how soon it’ll fade away / like a snowman”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it tails off a little bit at the end but that might just be because it starts out so strongly. It’s quite a short album, one of those ones that fades out almost as soon as its begun. If you’re getting the mulled wine out again, it might be worth putting it on repeat. I put it on quite late at my sister’s over Christmas and I think it’s the first time she’s said “that’s nice” about something that I’ve introduced her to. Well the first time in a while anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;woob-have-landed&quot;&gt;Woob “Have Landed”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/uc21/&quot;&gt;Last month I wrote about “Woob 2”&lt;/a&gt; shortly after finding out about the existence of this, the third (fourth?) Woob album. The previous albums have been long languid ambient affairs but “Have Landed”, despite retaining many elements of the earlier albums’ sound worlds, is positively busy by comparison. In addition to the sweeping strings and washes of synth, there are skittering drums and eastern elements that add even more to the atmosphere. I played a bit to a colleague at work and he asked if was listening to my code as it was running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I try to convince people of the merits of ambient music, the biggest objection they voice is that ambient music must be, by definition, somehow inert and boring. That’s far from the case here. “The Great Divide” is all sinews and fuzz and crunch that somehow manages to appear out of chirps and finger picked guitar work, while “Bognor Regis Stripper” has a woozy almost jazz-like feel and bizarrely sounds perfectly suited to its title. As we’ll see is not the only electronic album this month to feature a track that plays up the allusions to jazz. Elsewhere, I was genuinely surprised by the folk music motifs that appeared within tracks like “Sleep” and “Thieves”, not to mention the dramatic cellos that form the basis of the short “Interval” in the middle of the album or the spanish themes in “La Luna Y El Caballero”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous Woob albums have always felt like descriptions of nature, perhaps like soundtracks to imaginary nature documentaries. It is probably because of the wildlife stock photography that em:t records used on its covers. Some tracks on “Have Landed” retain that atmosphere (like “Sleep”) but I would say that this probably more an album about people and machines, with human melodies and mechanical beats much more prominent than before. Throughout there is also a soundtrack feel though I couldn’t pick out an underlying theme. This album is highly recommended if you love ambient music or if you’re looking for some highly engaging instrumental music. &lt;a href=&quot;http://woob.bandcamp.com/album/have-landed&quot;&gt;Buy it directly from them and support an artist that makes great music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tim-hecker-and-daniel-lopatin-instrumental-tourist&quot;&gt;Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin “Instrumental Tourist”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about Tim Hecker’s amazing “Ravedeath, 1972” album in January as part of an album catchup sequence that never really took off and Ford &amp;amp; Lopatin’s “Channel Pressure” was among my favourite albums of 2011: I wrote about it in an &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-august-2011/&quot;&gt;album digest in August&lt;/a&gt; that year. This is a collaboration between two of those three artists. Daniel Lopatin is also records as Oneohtrix Point Never and though his “Replica” album (and its &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchfork.com/features/take-cover/8705-oneohtrix-point-never-replica/&quot;&gt;amazing cover&lt;/a&gt;!) was well received earlier this year, I couldn’t really get in to it when I tried it on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not had much time to get into this album yet. For me the absolute stand out track is the first one “Uptown Psychedelia”. It is one of those tracks that is perfect for soundtracking those moments where you think your head is falling apart, precisely because listening to it makes you feel like your head is indeed falling apart. “Uptown Psychedelia” is dominated by Tim Hecker’s methods of processing existing sounds into new, fascinating, shapes and shades, but also benefits greatly from the greater attention to the underlying melodies and sounds, at least compared to the rather spartan “Ravedeath, 1972” tracks. I’m guessing this is what Dan Lopatin brings to the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to listen to the rest of the album again to get more of a feel for the remaining tracks but overall I was struck by how well they’d made processed electronic music sound free and improvised, as opposed to mechanical and manipulated. At one point, on “GRM Blue II”, it feels a bit like listening to free jazz played by dial-up modems – and I mean that in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;burial-truant--rough-sleeper-ep&quot;&gt;Burial “Truant / Rough Sleeper EP”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second Burial album that I’m going to be cack-handedly reviewing on these pages this year. The first was the “Kindred EP”, which &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-february-2012/&quot;&gt;I wrote about back in February&lt;/a&gt; and I wasn’t able to say a great deal about it beyond talking about how difficult it is to review music by this guy because it is just so different from anything else out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two tracks on this EP clock in at 11:45 and 13:47 respectively, and both tracks are mini-suites. “Truant” begins with a very confident and recognisable Burial sound: the rainfall, the shuffling beats and a female vocal sample (“I fell in love with you”). However, at about 3:55 everything cuts away – almost like someone pressing pause on a cassette player in the way that you can tell that it is stopping suddenly even as it stops… What comes in next is much more insistent, almost the same elements though the vocal sample is now diced up and rearranged to the point where none of the original phrase is discernible. I love the way his tracks build in such a beautiful layered way that you nod along and yet every time he can fool you by switching the beat slightly and throwing you off. Even better, by about 6:30 “Truant” sounds a bit like an old KLF record for a little while, it’s just majestically done. At 8:32 we get another “tape pause” moment and a skittery D’n’B rhythm comes in – though even that gets completely taken apart in the minutes that follow, it’s as though all these beats just drown in rain and static.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rough Sleeper” is warmer and more melodic and even features some sax at one point. The weird silence trick is employed again on this track but “Rough Sleeper” feels more like one evolving single track rather than about three glued together like “Truant”. I’d say the section from 4:00 to about 9:30 is probably the best bit of the whole EP: some really pretty vocals and melodies (with bells!) in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that constantly surprises me about Burial’s music is how he is able to consistently create tunes that are instantly recognisable as his but are never boring or cliché. Each new tune seems to add something different and offer a new take on what has gone before. Here he has taken a multitude of ideas and smooshed them together on two sides of vinyl. It might not be the length of a whole album but it certainly has enough invention and ideas for one. This pair and Kindred (together about 50 minutes) are well worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, November 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-november-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-november-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pretty much a sliding scale between songs and electronic wibble on this month’s albums and a particularly damp, chilly feeling to proceedings too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bat For Lashes “The Haunted Man”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ital “Hive Mind” and “Dream On”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Björk “Bastards”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brian Eno “Lux”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bat-for-lashes-the-haunted-man&quot;&gt;Bat For Lashes “The Haunted Man”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Bat For Lashes, I prefer her first album “Fur And Gold” to her second “Two Suns” because when I listen to the latter I don’t feel connected to any of the songs. For me, “Fur And Gold” remains a wonderful adventure throughout, it’s a fantastic listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while I thought that “The Haunted Man” just picked up where “Two Suns” left off and I didn’t think it was that great. However, at some point the tide turned and I really started to enjoy it. I think it was when I really started to pay attention to the tracks towards the end of the track listing. As I have mentioned before, I like to listen to albums while walking to and from work, and because of this I tend to enjoy albums more if the best tracks are at the beginning: my walk to work is just 35 minutes and so I don’t often get to listen to whole albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that “The Haunted Man” is definitely “back loaded”. Things really kick off with “Laura” (song number 5), it’s the song from this album that you are most likely to have already heard. It’s beautifully spare and sparse, a bit like “Moon and Moon” and delivered in the main from the piano with not much else to accompany it, just the odd phrase from a brass band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that comes “Winter Fields”, which I think really shows off of her songwriting skills with some beautiful imagery about the countryside. I think it is great that there is still music that taps into a sense of Englishness (in particular the pastoral aspect of English culture) and manages to draw out something dark and mysterious. It’s something that has been present right from the beginning in Bat For Lashes’ music, it tumbles out of the speakers right from the opening verses of “Horse And I”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing a hat trick of great songs in the middle of the album is the title track. I especially enjoy the glitchy intro, the strange Red-Box-esque drums and choir lines ahead of the chorus (actually it’s a lot like something off Kate Bush’s “Hounds Of Love” too) and the variety of synth sounds throughout: there’s some spooky stuff on the opening verse and some rich deep veins of sound underpinning the main chorus. It feels like a suite of several songs brought together but all the disparate elements combine beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere there are other really great songs, like “All My Gold” (a rattling tribal affair that channels “What’s A Girl To Do?”), “Marilyn” (like so many Bat For Lashes songs it is likeable because at points it just soars away into a beauty) and “A Wall” (simply because it was a grower and I have a grudging respect for songs that are growers). While the whole album doesn’t quite tell a whole story like “Fur And Gold” did, I still believe it all hangs together well as a coherent collection of quality songs. Highly Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ital-hive-mind-and-dream-on&quot;&gt;Ital “Hive Mind” and “Dream On”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are two mini albums that Ital has released this year, “Hive Mind” was released back in February (I got a copy in June) and “Dream On” was released earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to look at these two as two halves of a larger whole, especially as each “album” is just around 42 minutes long. In the case of “Hive Mind”, which consists of just five tracks, this mostly means long spools of near ambient dance music reminiscent of when ambient house had a significant house component to it. The music on “Hive Mind” reminds me a lot of early tracks by The Orb. In fact it sounds more like The Orb’s early remixes like, say, Maurizio’s “Ploy” (the astoundingly titled “Battersea Was An Island Of Mud mix”) – particularly on tracks like “Floridian Void” that unravel into dark swirls of electronica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand “Dream On” puts that darkness front and centre. It’s a much more in your face record, it’s both aggressive and forthright. There are fewer, briefer, tracks though the opener “Despot” gets to be just that and rattle and stamp its way through nearly nine minutes of chopped up vocals and retro sounding synths (I’m sure I can hear something that sounds like a Fairlight in there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each album has a track that appropriates vocal samples from a big pop act: the opening track of “Hive Mind” “Doesn’t Matter (If You Love Him)” takes snippets of vocals from Lady Gaga and Whitney Houston and shreds them into a robotic mix. Even more drastic is “Boi” on “Dream On” taking a sample of Beyoncé singing “baby boy” and folding it back over itself over and over again for seven and a half minutes. Its one of those genuinely delightful repetitions that ends up seemingly distorted the repeated words into something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed both albums. They may not necessarily be two halves of one whole, but they are certainly enjoyable back to back. If I had to choose, my preference would be for “Hive Mind” as it is a really absorbing collection of tunes and some of “Dream On” is a little too abrasive for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bjork-bastards&quot;&gt;Bjork “Bastards”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say what you like about Björk, she doesn’t half know how to shift a lot of merchandise. This is yet another remix album, this time centred on the “Biophilia” album and mostly comprising a selection from a sequence of limited edition singles released throughout the year. I’ve collected those singles and so I’ve only listened to this album on Spotify because I have most of the tracks already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has to be said that I was really wanting to give this album a kicking because at first glance the tracklisting looks terrible - there are some glaring omissions and including one Death Grips mix (let alone two!) represents the inclusion of one Death Grips remix too many. Also, all of Biophilia’s tracks were covered over the course of the eight singles, so it makes no sense for this album not to do the same. Particularly when the most glaring omission is “Cosmogony” which was the stand out track from “Biophilia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I enjoyed the singles and so the bulk of the material here is good and I do find myself warming to the selection, it certainly flows quite well. Little experiments like including Matthew Herbert’s remix of “Sacrifice” as a 50 second reprise after the horrible Death Grips version is a nice little experiment (though if I didn’t have the full version on single number 6 I would be a little miffed). There are still way too many mixes of “Thunderbolt” for me, meaning that the line “scrape these barnacles off me” (yes! really!) appears about four times over the run time of “Bastards”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oscar Souleyman mix of “Crystalline” is amazing and it wasn’t on the singles, it’s my favourite thing on the collection. But then the Current Value mix of “Crystalline” is awesome too and is sadly overlooked, admittedly in favour of his mix of “Solstice” so it’s not all bad. In my view, the wrong mix of “Hollow” is on there too (but the good one is by Current Value too!) and if a mix of “Thunderbolt” has to be there, then why on earth wasn’t it the King Cannibal one? Nevertheless, there are some small revelations: when I first heard the remix of “Mutual Core” I was really underwhelmed, but there’s something about the way those Solomon Islands singers slot very nicely into the opening half of the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Björk has released better albums than “Biophilia” (&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2011&quot;&gt;something that I discussed last year&lt;/a&gt;) and has also released two better remix albums than “Bastards” in the shape of the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Mixes_from_the_Album_Debut_for_All_the_People_Who_Don%27t_Buy_White_Labels&quot;&gt;“The Best Mixes from the Album Debut for All the People Who Don’t Buy White Labels”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(album)&quot;&gt;“Telegram”&lt;/a&gt;. Those two told us new things about their parent albums: “The Best Mixes from the Album Debut…” revealed anew the startling plasticity of her sound by manipulating &lt;a href=&quot;uc15&quot;&gt;the amazing songs from Debut&lt;/a&gt; into stellar symphonies of electronic music; while “Telegram” completely retooled “Post” into bizarre and wonderful shapes, into shapes so contorted that her next album would in fact have to be “Homogenic” in response. “Bastards” does nothing for “Biophilia”, both are patchy albums and perhaps show that not only is Björk is need of a reinvention (beyond apps) but that many of the people remixing her need new ideas too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brian-eno-lux&quot;&gt;Brian Eno “Lux”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A Small Craft On A Milk Sea” was one of my favourite albums of 2010 (it was, apparently, a reworking of a rejected soundtrack to Peter Jackson’s adaptation of “The Lovely Bones”) and I wrote about how much I enjoyed last year’s collaboration on “Drums Between The Bells” with Rick Holland. I also chose &lt;a href=&quot;uc16&quot;&gt;“Ambient 2/Plateaux Of Mirror”&lt;/a&gt; as one of my understated classics, so there is a lot of Eno love on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lux” is a new solo album of four longish pieces, as with “Music For Airports” each part would fill one side of vinyl. In general there isn’t much more to say. The music is like dappled sunlight or the shadows of billowing smoke: as much not there as it is there. It is not really minimalist but there is definitely an economy in the use of the elements of available. It drifts around the room and makes for very pleasant background listening.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Mountain Story</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/a-mountain-story"/>
   <updated>2012-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-mountain-story</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A cat reaches the top of a mountain after a long climb through the snow. He is cold from the bottom of his fur to the tips of his claws. He is sodden and wet, and we all know how much a cat hates to be wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the mountain there is not much to see. What may have been a breathtaking view is instead a murk of freezing mist and at any rate, snow assails the cat’s eyes and whiskers. He shivers and sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bless you!” cries a dog who is already there, he sits about twenty metres away and is wearing a pair of sunglasses. “Come here and rest a while weary traveller!” He motions to his left and sweeps about two inches of snow off the bench he is sitting on. It is painted green as though it has been just this instant transported from a suburban park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat explains how arduous his journey has been. How he had heard the wolves howl in the evenings, how he had forded rushing rivers of water so cold he had feared that their icy grip would forever stain his bones, how the stark and unrelenting stare of the moon had borne down upon him with such cruelty that he swore that it had begun to mock him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You must be starving! How rude of me!” interrupts the dog. He offers the cat a bit of kitkat. It’s a green tea and white chocolate one, like they have in Japan. It tastes strange despite the cat not being sure whether he has ever eaten a regular kitkat anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat gets upset. “Why are you here? Did you not struggle also? Why are you wearing sunglasses? Why is this bench here? It doesn’t make any sense!” Hot tears streak down his face and they sizzle into the air, the warmest thing for miles around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the cat composes himself, the dog explains how all things are impermanent and transient. “All of this is an illusion” he says, “not in the sense of whether it is real of course…” He leans forward and pinches the cat, who hisses in reaction. “No, it is an illusion that any of this has a meaning and I am not just talking about park benches at the top of mountains or the cruel face of the moon…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat stares out blankly at the snow. The mist billows into patterns that have never been seen before, patterns that will never be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog asks the cat to tell a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat says that he doesn’t know any jokes. “I’m afraid I never could remember them well and I could never really tell a story very well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this the dog asks “well then, how on earth will you tell anyone about what happens next?” With these words, the dog hands his sunglasses to the cat and promptly disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the mountain, the snow continues to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #21: Woob 2 by Woob</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-21"/>
   <updated>2012-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-21</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The second Woob album (AKA “Woob 4495”) is probably the greatest ambient album ever made and is certainly the best one you have never heard of. Originally released in 1995 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emit.cc&quot;&gt;on the em:t label&lt;/a&gt; it is also a rare record. I don’t have an actual copy but I have seen one! I downloaded it off the internet and even that is quite difficult to do. My friend is an avid collector of all the em:t releases and it is easy to see why: all the albums are titled in a specific way that is very appealing to people who like to collect things and they also have very striking nature photography on the covers. In a strange way, the label was able to create an identity for its releases in a way that many artists would try to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the em:t label failed and it is hard to know if post-internet (things were still getting underway in the early/mid-90s) it might have had an easier time selling these albums. You can now get the first Woob album on iTunes and this second album was re-released in a remixed form as “Repurpose” back in 2010. There is a rabid second hand market for em:t records releases and “Woob 2”, sorry “Woob 4495”, is among the most sought-after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I listened to “Woob 2” again when I was writing this post something very obvious struck me about it. It is by far and away the most played record in my iTunes. I have played each track on the album (there are seven) between 57 and 75 times. I’ve played the 25 minute track “Depart” 60 times, which means I have spent more than a day of my life listening to just that track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually there is a very good reason why I have listened to this album so many times. It’s my favourite album for falling asleep to. I appreciate that this is hardly a ringing endorsement as it is unlikely that I would continually listen to it at night if it didn’t help me drop off – and something that makes you fall asleep is not often considered as high art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except these are troubled times &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/20/sleeping-pills-britains-hidden-addiction&quot;&gt;and reports show that people are finding it increasingly difficult to sleep&lt;/a&gt;. I know for a fact that my post containing &lt;a href=&quot;five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep&quot;&gt;five ideas to help you out when you can’t sleep&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular on the blog. Falling asleep is a big deal. In order to be able to sleep, you have to feel safe and secure, to be able to relax away from the stresses and trials of the day gone by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who cannot sleep &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; listening to music, I can tell you that there are actually very few albums that you can fall asleep to all the time. Granted there are times that you are so knackered that anything will send you off, but then on other occasions you can actively listen to something all the way through and be wide awake at the end. It’s also true that most ambient albums try to scupper any attempts to fall asleep, either with sudden loud noises or with spooky quotes. There’s an extended sample in the first Woob album that scares me too much to listen to at night, which is why it hasn’t be played anywhere near as much as the second one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music itself is very straightforward ambient music. There are synths, drones, chants, tribal drums, flutes, cheesy guitar riffs, bells, chimes, and insect chirps throughout. No vocals though (those formless chants aside) and so it’s a very pure natural experience. Personally I often find myself meditating on that toucan on the cover as I listen. Moreover, if you listen to it during the day (have a cup of coffee just in case), you find that it is actually a very active and engaging album. Sure, there is plenty of noodling that you can put to the back of your mind but the drums and melodies throughout are actually quite striking and emotive when you find yourself paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album, perhaps more than other that I have written about, epitomises the understated classic. It’s an album that you are not likely to have heard of, one that you cannot get (unless you want to take a £40 punt on a copy from eBay or go digging on useNet), one that is objectively brilliant, and one that I have a deep emotional connection to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can you do if you fancy a listen? Well, if you know me you can obviously ask me for the MP3s or come over and have a listen first. Better still you could support Woob by buying “Repurpose” &lt;a href=&quot;http://woob.bandcamp.com/album/repurpose&quot;&gt;from their Bandcamp website&lt;/a&gt; (or you can listen to it there for free). “Repurpose” is described as a remastered “Woob 4495” with some detours and deviations, it really is just as good. Even better news (for me at least) is that there is also now a “Woob 3” (except it is called “Have Landed”) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://woob.bandcamp.com/album/have-landed&quot;&gt;you can buy that from their website too&lt;/a&gt;. All the collectors have already been there and got the limited edition stuff, but I’m off to get a digital version right now… perhaps tonight it will be sending me to sleep!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rust And Bone: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/rust-and-bone-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2012-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/rust-and-bone-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, two short reviews in a row. I had the day off work and went to see “Rust And Bone” this afternooon. It’s the new film by Jacques Audiard, who directed “A Prophet” – one of my favourite films of the last five years&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rust And Bone” is a love story about Ali, a sexually feckless security guard who is struggling to look after his young son on his own, and Stéphanie (played by second most beautiful woman in the world, Marion Cotillard), who is injured while working as a co-ordinator of killer whale displays at an ocenarium. Needless to say it is not a minor injury. The film is basically their love story. I don’t feel so much responsibility to hide plot details about this film because, to be frank, I could type out the whole plot here and it wouldn’t convey the reasons why it’s so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas “Skyfall” was an enjoyable film by virtue of being well paced dumb entertainment, “Rust And Bone” is that other type of great film: the one that tries to tell us a new story while trying to explain something about all of us at the same time. It’s full of gritty moments, both physical and psychological, and also moments of transcendant delight and beauty. There were points were it felt like a wire was being worked into my chest and yet there are also moments of deep delight and sweetness. For the most part it is shot with a documentary style that makes it feel very immediate and real, but as with “A Prophet” there are also giddy slow motion shots and scenes that are loose and unstructured and dream-like. However, what drives it more than anything else is two superb acting performances by Marion Cotilliard and Matthias Schoenaerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not a flawless movie. It runs out of steam at the end despite maintaining the high drama and the fact that probably the most unpleasant scene is near the end of the film. I felt that it could have been slightly longer to help tease out some of what happened. Sometimes a lack of exposition in a movie helps to build mystery but here it just smacks of poor editing, to the point where I feel a bit like I haven’t watched a complete film. That’s probably harsher criticism than I intend given my feelings for the movie as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I described the film to my housemate earlier this evening, I realised that so much of what I had seen had been geared to getting me to understand the characters and to feel for them. I had to describe convoluted cause and effect ripples through the plot as one person’s actions impacted on others. I was describing the characters (especially Ali) as though they were people that I knew (or at least had watched in a soap opera for a long time!) and it was quite disconcerting how far the film had got under my skin. It’s highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also really enjoyed the soundtrack. The score was by Alexandre Desplat who also did “Moonrise Kingdom” and the soundtrack also includes Bon Iver and Lykke Li, along with a dance remix of “State Trooper” by Bruce Springsteen – something that I had long imagined myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I will certainly be digging out my DVD copy of “A Prophet” this weekend. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Skyfall: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/skyfall-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2012-11-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/skyfall-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went to see “Skyfall” last night and I really enjoyed it. I knew nothing about the plot, mostly because I had avoided all discussion of the plot with people who had already seen it and I even avoided reviews as so many these days seem to just rattle off plot points, instead of discussing what makes the movie any good. With that in mind I will obviously try not to give away any of the plot in this brief review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think “Skyfall” is probably the most enjoyable Bond movie that I have seen. It takes a lot of the now familiar formula - starting &lt;em&gt;in medias res&lt;/em&gt;, lavish animated intro (Adele’s theme song is stunning), a completely unhinged villain - and manages to produce a solid and entertaining film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of it’s blogs this week the Guardian asked whether Bond had become too grim and serious. I’d say that Skyfall does have a more mournful tone but there are hints of light and brightness too. There were plenty of moments where the whole cinema laughed as one. I think the days of Roger Moore’s arched eyebrows are over, as are lazy characterisations of slapstick American sherrifs who are fat and short-tempered. I am glad that “Skyfall” isn’t a po-mo- deconstruction of who or what Bond should represent in the twenty-first century, I like that there is some suspension of belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless it is a modern Bond film and I think it shows most in the cinematography. There were scenes that just looked wonderfully beautiful and bonkers at the same time. They reminded me of scenes from “Enter The Void” and I think it is great that a populist vehicle such as a Bond movie is being used to introduce people to wonderful cinematography. I realised a few scenes later that it is a large part of Bond’s popularity, that each Bond movie is partly a reflection of our times. For fifty years the Bond movie has been a sort of travelogue introducing (or re-introducing) us to parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the acting was excellent and to my eyes Daniel Craig is fast becoming the definitive Bond. Javier Bardem’s turn as the scenery-chewing baddie is really something to behold, though his performance feels a bit wasted in this plot and it might have been better for him to play someone intent on blowing up the moon or something. It’s always good to see Ben Whishaw in anything but he’s underused and I’ve already been spoiled by his stunning performance as Richard II in “The Hollow Crown” on the BBC earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, October 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-october-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-october-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been a strange month and I found that I didn’t listen to a lot of new music. I have been a bit down and when that’s the case I tend to take refuge in music that I know well, stuff that cheers me up. I have listened to last month’s fave a lot, Nelly Furtado’s “The Spirit Indestructible”. I said a lot of nice things about it but it probably didn’t come over in my writing just how much I really liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there were five albums I mostly got my teeth into this month though I didn’t listen to them as often as I would have liked. I will write now about four of the five that are similar to one another. The fifth album is “The Haunted Man” by Bat For Lashes, but I will wait until next month to write about that as I’d like to take a little more time to unpack it and get to know the songs better. The other four albums don’t really have songs, so it is less of a problem. All four are by and large abstract electronic albums and so I am going to write about them in a pretty general way. The albums are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Dependent And Happy” by Ricardo Villalobos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“The Expanding Universe” by Laurie Spiegel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Jiaolong” by Daphni&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Mala In Cuba” by Mala&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had heard a lot of strange things about Ricardo Villalobos. He was one of the first artists to turn in a Fabric compiliation consisting solely of his own tracks (I wrote about a similar enterprise by Guy Gerber &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-june-2012&quot;&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;) and then there was that weird business of the 31 minute single based around a single trumpet sample or something (which I haven’t yet heard). &lt;strong&gt;“Dependent and Happy”&lt;/strong&gt; was released in two versions: a CD with 11 tracks and then a 14 track version across 3 12” packs (2 double and one single, making for ten sides in total). Despite already having adventures with vinyl this year, I decided to buy the CD version and then cheekily get the versions from the vinyl edition by (ahem) other means. It’s not just a case of missing out on three tracks if you stick to the CD version, the vinyl contains longer versions of some of the tracks. (I did not actually manage to get a rip of the third vinyl, so I am two tracks down on this version of the album, though one of them is on the CD and is probably, at 12 minutes long, unedited).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tracks on the vinyl version are longer and are perhaps meant to be consumed at three seperate sittings, whereas the CD features shorter tracks that are mixed together and to be consumed all in one go. Either way it’s an exhausting album of minimal techno that on headphones worms its way into your ears and shatters your brain. I think I prefer the CD version for its brevity, though there is a lot to favour the widescreen and sinuous 12 minute vinyl version of “Tu Actiuud” over the 9 minute one on the CD. I really haven’t listened to it enough to remember what else pops out apart from the amazing last track (on the CD) called “Die Schwarze Massai”, it’s quite short and it bubbles along in a crisp way – like a slightly more animated version of &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-july-2012&quot;&gt;Mohn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “Dependent And Happy” is all sleek modern abstraction, then &lt;strong&gt;the reissue of Laurie Spiegel’s “The Exanding Universe”&lt;/strong&gt; represents an origin point of sorts. The music on “The Expanding Universe” was composed and recorded with the computers at Bell Laboratories in the mid to late 1970s. Just 5 of the 19 tracks on this reissue were on the original album, so it represents a really interesting archive of music being made with computers at that time. There are really interesting liner notes with the CD and I’m looking forward to reading them more closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music here is a gentle classical music of sorts entirely created on computers. Obviously there were analogue synths as early as the late 60s but computer music in the 70s would have relied on machines the size of a fridge and operated by punch card, a wholly different way of creating music digitally than is the case today. However, the important question is whether, as with Kraftwerk, the music stands up as something innately interesting rather than simply as a curio or evolutionary waypoint in the development of electronic music. I think that the music does indeed stand up well to the passage of time. It is quite minimal and relies on repetition and counterpoint, but it is really quite relaxing and beautiful. Perhaps the best example of just how pretty some of the tracks are is “East River Dawn”, a wonderfully shifting piece lasting just over 14 minutes that evokes its title perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting thought about this music in relation to the minimalism of Philip Glass and others. I often feel that the minimalist composers are not very compassionate to the people who have to perform their pieces. I did wonder whether the pieces on “The Expanding Universe”, written to be performed by a computer, are in fact more human (and humane) than the pieces composed with the intention to be performed by humans. I guess it is a minor point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not listened to &lt;strong&gt;Daphni’s “JiaoLong”&lt;/strong&gt; anywhere near enough. I know this because every time that I do listen to it, I have a whale of a time. In many ways it is a similar album to Four Tet’s “Pink” (&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-september-2012&quot;&gt;which I wrote about last month&lt;/a&gt;): a collection of tracks recorded for various twelve inches and DJ sets – this time by Dan Snaith, the central brain behind Manitoba/Caribou. These tracks are clearly geared toward the dancefloor, no mucking about, and they are all the more enjoyable for it. I tried to do some work while listening to this and I just ended up dancing along instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I like about this album is that it is pretty brief, so nothing overstays its welcome. My favourite tracks: “Yes, I Know” a wonderful collision between something really wiggy like Vitalic’s “Poney” and a 70’s dancefloor hit… …that sounds like it’s playing in a dustbin; “Pairs” a steady simple track that is grafiti’d with all manner of basslines and synth squiggles; “Springs” which descends into tweaky acid madness that really does make you think of springs; “Long”, a warm and hazy closing track that is probably as warm and cosy as a track still aimed squarely at the floor could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mala In Cuba”&lt;/strong&gt; is an intruiging dubstep album built out of samples sourced by Mala on a trip to Cuba. Unfortunately, while it is certainly an interesting listen, I found that the fusion of the two worlds was not quite as complete as I’d hoped. It strikes me as much more of a dubstep album than one filled with references to Cuba or Cuban music. In fact it isn’t really until about halfway through the album (“Como Como”) when a bit of real latin flavour really starts to shine through. “Cuba Electronic” (which follows “Como Como”) is probably the first successful attempt to produce something genuinely new on the album – a wonderful skittering rush that leans heavily on latin percussion samples. Up until then there are clearly latin sounds present but the atmosphere is much more Hoxton than Havana, it’s a rather homeopathic infusion of latin beats into the dubstep sound. (However I do need to listen to it a few more times…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the track that really hammers home just how good an album “Mala In Cuba” could have been is the final track “Noche Sueños”: the vocal helps to establish the flavour but I also think it is the reason for retaining more instrumentation so that while the synths and drum machines provide surface detail, there are also some organic elements that help to sustain the atmosphere. However, listening to the track again for the purposes of writing this, I found that there were more electronics present than I remembered – again showing how much more successful “Noche Sueños” is compared to the rest of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stevenage vs Portsmouth</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/stevenage-vs-portsmouth"/>
   <updated>2012-10-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/stevenage-vs-portsmouth</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight, despite feeling a bit under the weather, I went to Stevenage to watch Portsmouth play a League One game at the Lamex Stadium. In addition, I met a “person off the internet” for the second time in a week – this time Tom, a friend of a friend from Facebook: our shared passions being Portsmouth FC and really cool music. We met at King’s Cross and caught a packed train to Stevenage, a non-descript dormitory town that was even more non-descript than I remember St Albans being. I’m glad I went, even though Pompey lost. It’s funny how sitting in a shed in the cold watching your team lose counts as entertainment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-of-the-lamex-stadium&quot;&gt;Impressions of the Lamex stadium&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been to many football grounds, until tonight it had just been Fratton Park, Twerton Park, Craven Cottage, La Romareda (in Zaragoza, Spain) and two versions of Wembley.The Lamex was pretty much how I expected it but it seems ideal for the needs of the club. It’s fairly functional but the constant drizzle was kept off our heads and our seats were decent enough to see everything. The funniest chant of the night from the Pompey fans was “your shed’s too big for you” – a bit rich I thought, given the state of Fratton Park, but sometimes it’s nice to dish it out when you’ve had to take it for years. One side of the pitch was standing-only, a definite echo of the club’s non-league past but also a source of (admittedly intermittent) buzzing pulsating noise. At times you wondered if their fans thought they were at a rave rather than a football match such was their admirable commitment to bouncing up and down like lunatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-match&quot;&gt;The match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beforehand I’d said to Tom that I thought Portsmouth might lose. Stevenage are doing really well and were second place in League One going into this game. Meanwhile Pompey were unbeaten in five games prior to this match. Something had to give and my prediction was that it would be Pompey: it can’t be easy for our flung together bunch of players to get results (half) week in (half) week out. I was right, Portsmouth lost 2-1. On the train home, I ruefully looked at the stats in the programme I had bought and noticed that neither team had lost after taking the lead this season. It’s all the more frustrating then that Stevenage scored a soft goal quite early, taking advantage of some non-existent marking. After that Portsmouth, who had already started timidly, proceeded to disappear from the rest of the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half was a much better performance from Pompey – it probably helped that they were playing towards the goal that we were all roaring at them from behind and that they are the best scorers in the league in the second half of games this season. There was a great chance for Wes Thomas that nearly went in and I think that if it had the game would have been Pompey’s. As it was we had to wait a little bit longer until a rather flukey looking goal from Jon Harley (who was probably Pompey’s man of the match for me) equalised. Pompey obviously scented blood but Stevenage had settled and began to carve out chances of their own. Just ten minutes later they scored a well-taken goal from a set piece and it felt again like it had been a gift from Pompey, bitterly disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, all the attacking threat came from Pompey but with very little end product. Izale Mcloed was only intermittently lively (I was looking forward to seeing him play so it was a bit of a disappointment) and I think a lot of the players did not know how to make the right sort of incisive final pass or cross that would set up genuine opportunities. The number of shots and shots on target &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19958342&quot;&gt;given in the BBC’s match report&lt;/a&gt; seems false to me (maybe they did better in the first half up the other end in the mist than it seemed in the away end) but there you go. Still, I don’t think any of the Pompey players were in any way half-hearted… I went home sad rather than angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-end-bit&quot;&gt;The end bit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Football is an expensive game now. The ticket cost £23 and the train journey (lasting 26 minutes) from King’s Cross cost £18. The food at the ground looked reasonable (well, certainly hefty) but I don’t know the price because I’d already had a pasty before leaving London. I certainly couldn’t afford that every week, so I definitely have a great respect for my fellow Pompey fans who sang amazingly despite the situation and the cold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and finally a word of praise must go out to the tannoy announcer at the Lamex Stadium, he was a sort of cross between Stuart Hall, Alan Partridge, and a vicar at a village fete. Could have done without the speakers being up at ear-splitting volume though, I bet it’s only like that in the away end.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nonlinear Systems: A Rough Intro</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/nonlinear-systems-a-rough-intro"/>
   <updated>2012-10-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/nonlinear-systems-a-rough-intro</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is another mathematics post that does not actually feature any equations or graphs. It is intended to set the way clear for writing regularly about nonlinear systems. This in itself is a precursor to writing more about mathematical biology as biological systems are inherently complex and nonlinear. I am reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nonlinear-Systems-Cambridge-Applied-Mathematics/dp/0521406684/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1349212296&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;P. G. Drazin’s textbook on Nonlinear Systems&lt;/a&gt; and this post is a glossary of terms from the start of the book laid down here because I wanted to remember how to typeset &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp&quot;&gt;definition lists&lt;/a&gt; in Markdown (though in the end I (ab)used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags because it looked better).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonlinear-system&quot;&gt;Nonlinear system&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A set of nonlinear equations, which may be algebraic, functional, ordinary differential, partial differential, integral or a combination of these. Often the system will depend on given parameters. It is generally helpful to think of a nonlinear system as a feedback loop in which the response is not proportional to the the input. There are a great number of applications for the theory of nonlinear systems, as we shall see when the series of mathematical biology posts really gets going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dynamical-system&quot;&gt;Dynamical system&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much a synonym for nonlinear system but an emphasis is usually placed on the evolution of a solution over time or a time-like variable. The phrase comes from the name of equations governing the motion of a system of particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonlinearity-effect-of&quot;&gt;Nonlinearity, effect of&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a parameter that governs a particular system changes slowly, a solution may change into slowly and continuously or abruptly and discontinuously (a catastrophe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;steady-solution-steady-state&quot;&gt;Steady solution (steady state)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A persistent long-term solution of a set of nonlinear equations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stable-solution-stable-steady-state&quot;&gt;Stable solution (stable steady state)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those solutions to a system that if perturbed slightly remain near their starting position for ever afterward. Usually such solutions are the more frequently observed (e.g. a body at rest on a smooth surface).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unstable-solution-unstable-steady-state&quot;&gt;Unstable solution (unstable steady state)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some systems can be perturbed from rest and not respond in a predictable fashion. The long term behaviour of an unstable solution will depend significantly on the nature of the initial displacement and the system may move a long way from its initial position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;butterfly-effect&quot;&gt;Butterfly Effect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular characterisation of an unstable solution to a nonlinear system is that “a butterfly flapping its wings in Tokyo today could cause a hurricane in Paris next week”, the intention being to capture how small changes in the initial conditions of a complex nonlinear system such as the atmosphere can lead to large disturbances in the system over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bifurcation&quot;&gt;Bifurcation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a parameter of a nonlinear system is varied and the qualitative nature of the solutions change, a bifurcation is said to have occurred. Specifically the study of bifurcations is the study of how the number of steady states of a nonlinear system change as its parameters are varied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;symmetry-breaking&quot;&gt;Symmetry breaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bifurcations can also alter the symmetry of solutions to nonlinear systems. By symmetry we mean that the set of solutions of the nonlinear system is invariant under some group of translations (but the solutions therein need not be invariant). The presence of symmetries is often closely connected to the stability of solutions of the underlying nonlinear system. Whenever symmetries are involved, group theory looms large. A refresher on groups will follow in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;periodic-solutions&quot;&gt;Periodic solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some systems will have periodic stable solutions. Bifurcating parameters can also feature regimes with periodic solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chaotic-solutions&quot;&gt;Chaotic solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonlinear systems may have aperiodic solutions that appear to be random yet have stationary statistical properties (the mean and variance do not change with time). These are called chaotic solutions. Such solutions can be considered stable if they persist for all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That concludes the list and is pretty much all that can be said without providing proper mathematical definitions. The next post in this sequence will also be rather basic, a list of types of bifurcations illustrated by a few graphs. There will be equations galore and hopefully the graphs will be special too, rather than jpgs exported from R. After that, we’ll get into the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, September 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-09-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had a bit more time to listen to this month’s albums because I was on holiday for two weeks. I didn’t manage to write about them while on holiday though! In fact I bought and listened to a few more, but I will save them for next month. The albums I will discuss now (in order bought) are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Four Tet “Pink”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The xx “Coexist”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nelly Furtado “The Spirit Indestructible”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grizzly Bear “Shields”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite a diverse collection and, Four Tet apart, quite song based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-tet-pink&quot;&gt;Four Tet “Pink”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pink” is a collection of tracks that were self-released on vinyl throughout the last year. The first track “Locked” was featured on Four Tet’s fabriclive mix &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-september-2011&quot;&gt;that I wrote about in last Semptember’s album digest&lt;/a&gt; (as was “Pyramid”), there it was the closing track in the mix and served to wind everything down. It is strange how well it also works as a build-up track, I haven’t checked to see if they are the same version but the one on “Pink” slowly builds, introducing various elements (including…) in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lion” has a wonderfully spooky riff that looms into view at about 2:50 over an old school beat but it pretty much holds that structure until about 8:00 (with about 50 seconds to go) when the pulse of the track is lowered and some gentle chimes introduced. “Lion” definitely strikes me as one side of a twelve inch, it’s structure is one of getting into a groove and holding that for a fixed period – either until the chimes or until something is dropped into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is foreknowledge of how this album came to exist but compared to “There Is Love In You”, “Pink” definitely feels like a collection of discrete entities. Most of the tracks here could stand alone, but I couldn’t imagine listening to “Love Cry” without also hearing “Sing” or “Angel Echoes” in the same fifty or so minutes. Here you have those floor-oriented tracks but there are also tracks like “Jupiters”, which, despite being one of the shortest tracks, features about three movements in just under six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ocoras” is another short and simple track, while “128 Harps” doesn’t seem to feature 128 harps but does seem to feature the main riff of “Moon”, the opening track from Bjork’s “Biophilia”. It also has some nice texture and a weird sampled vocal loop, one of those that seems to blur into swearwords as it is repeated over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really remember where “Pyramid” slots into Four Tet’s fabric mix but I do remember the vocal loop. I think we can count it as one of the set-building tracks here. After that comes “Peace For Earth”, the longest and most satisfying track on “Pink”. It is quite slow and ambient throughout, at points it resembles something from &lt;a href=&quot;uc16&quot;&gt;Brian Eno and Howard Budd’s “Ambient 2: The Plateaux Of Mirror”&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere (around the 5:00 mark) it picks up the pace a little and could be said to resemble “Sing” (a sort of slowed-down, weirder, cousin) from the previous album, especially the longer edit that appeared on the single.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pink” rounds out with “Pinnacles”, which plays out in style of “Locked” and “Lion” but is perhaps a little more interesting because it features elements that are closer to something song-based. I’m not describing what I mean very well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-xx-coexist&quot;&gt;The xx “Coexist”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Coexist” is the second album by The xx and much like the first one, it’s quite slight and evasive. Every song is short and fleeting, many are similar to one another, giving the impression of a thirty five minute suite of songs that are facets of one larger whole. That said, this album does throw in some spikier bits than the previous one (though admittedly that would not be that hard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the first track “Angels” is beautiful and I was blown away when I heard it in advance of the album. In many ways it is even &lt;em&gt;sparer&lt;/em&gt; than most of the songs on “Xx” and it weaves into that time between sunset and streetlights, a perfect song for dusk. Sadly, it’s the high point of an album that’s interesting as an experiment but not really that great as a bunch of songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fiction” has a nice pulse to it (the whole album is “nice”), but the chiming guitar riff that runs through it and the previous song “Chained” are like echoes of “Angels” so the first three tracks all feel like different parts of one whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile “Try” has this weird slowed-down siren of a riff but that’s really the only thing that sets it apart from “Angels”, “Chained” and “Fiction”. This seems to be the problem with the album. On the first album, songs like “VCR” and “Islands” stood out from the rest of the songs on the album and also seemed to be about &lt;em&gt;different things&lt;/em&gt;, whereas “Coexist” is a bunch of songs that basically do just that… they coexist, layering over the top of one another and all moping about a point of indeterminacy in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have “Coexist” on in the background for it’s thirty five minute runtime, you’ll lift your head once or twice to pay attention and that’s it. Unfortunately it’s boring enough to work to (how do you think I got all this website organised on my holiday?!) but too boring to fall asleep to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nelly-furtado-the-spirit-indestructible&quot;&gt;Nelly Furtado “The Spirit Indestructible”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a Nelly Furtado album is never boring. “The Spirt Indestructible” might be a bit lowest common denominator in parts and extra-cheesy in others, but it knows where your pleasure centres are and determinedly attempts to tap them repeatedly over its twelve song core. It is largely successful in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the songs are better than they were on “Loose” and once again they can be divided into broad groups: relentlessly positive (the title track, “High-Life”, “Bucket List”, “Enemy”, “Believers (Arab Spring)”), hip-hop dalliances (“High Life”, “Something”), ill-advised sexual braggadocio (thankfully restricted to just “Hoops (The Bigger The Better)” this time), party tunes (“Parking Lot”, “Waiting For The Night”) and keening love songs (“The Most Beautiful Thing”, “Circles”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That classification might make “The Spirit Indestructible” look like a bit of a mess and on the first few listens it is, a chaotic jumble of styles that very much confirms &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contactmusic.com/news/nelly-furtado-album-delayed_1329454&quot;&gt;the rumours that it was repeatedly put back by the record company&lt;/a&gt; because they had no idea how to sell it. However, after a few listens it begins to knit together really well (despite the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;uc20&quot;&gt;much like her still-best album “Folklore”&lt;/a&gt; it does sag a bit at the end) because there are tracks that span several of the categories. For example, the title track also has a party bit in it even if it is a shame that the lyrics to the middle 8 are just the repetition of “AEIOU” (well I did say it was lowest common denominator in parts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAS throws in a rather perfunctory rap and steals the limelight on “Something” (nice Terminator reference though), which would otherwise be a rather sweet and understated song about love and trust (Hook: “I want to give you something / I know how to make something out of nothing”). However, on “High Life” the rap verses really add to the song and transform it into something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was quite impressed with “Parking Lot”. It might sound like M.I.A. (uncannily so) but smoothed down and made “chart friendly” (whatever that means now that the charts mean virtually nothing), but there’s a nice spark to it – and there’s no way that M.I.A. could squeeze in the deliriously demented doowop bit at the end either. (Also, M.I.A’s third album was terrible – so we should be grateful for mainstream clones.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t carry on and tell you about every song, but I should mention “Circles” because for ages I completely ignored it. It’s tucked away deep in the album’s weaker second half and while it is rather understated, it’s a lovely little love song that deserves your attention. Nelly actually does these really well, I guess that’s why quite a few people pine for another album like “Folklore”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish up, this a great little mainstream album that will cheer you up if you are down and is great in the mornings for getting you pepped up for the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grizzly-bear-shields&quot;&gt;Grizzly Bear “Shields”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shields” strikes me as being similar to “Life’s Rich Pageant” by R.E.M., not so much in terms of sound but in terms of marking a point where a band suddenly clicks, realises its strengths, and decides to play to all of them at once. Another similar comparison might be “OK Computer” by Radiohead, where that band not only delivered the songs but also a coherent aesthetic to go with them. I think “Shields” is a fantastic album, full of stunning songs all wrapped up in a gorgeous sound world that is at once both familiar and totally unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sleeping Ute” is apparently the sole surviving song from an initial recording session for this album and it still has the air of “Veckatimest” hanging around its shoulders. When “Speak In Rounds” kicks in, the difference is obvious – the two singers’ voices are much more confident and the pace of the song turns on a sixpence thanks to the fantastic playing of the band. Previously Grizzly Bear songs shimmered and simmered but “Speak In Rounds” just leaps out of the speakers and sounds like it has always existed, has always been a classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything on “Shields”” sounds purposeful and engaged, even the hallucinatory little instrumental “Adelma”. Right from the first line of “Yet Again” a story is being told, whereas on previous albums songs like “Dory” (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) and “Two Weeks” seemed to just hover and be impressionistic. Going back to the R.E.M. comparison that I started with, early tracks like “Laughing” and “Harborcoat” are among my favourite songs but more for mood than meaning, whereas something later like “Welcome To The Occupation” is much more engaged with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sense of atmosphere and place has not been abandoned though, the squally outro to “Yet Again” and the dense sonics of “The Hunt” (not to mention the more familiar vocal) capably show that. It’s just that now a sense of engagement and spirit now courses through the band’s playing. The lyrics are better too, I looked them up on the internet and the nature of the singing means that there are still liberal “???”’s strewn throughout people’s transcriptions but as I listened closely and filled in the gaps, I fell deeper in love with these songs. Check out the lyrics to “A Simple Answer”, they’re excellent. The last time I remember being so deliberately engaged with a band’s lyrics was with those on “Alligator” by The National.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d write more but all the songs are quite dense and so I need to listen to them a lit more to fully get to grips with them. I guess that is a hearty recommendation in itself but let’s be completely unequivocal: “Shields” is thoroughly recommended as one of the best albums of the year so far.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jon McGregor, Even The Dogs</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/even-the-dogs"/>
   <updated>2012-09-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/even-the-dogs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over my holiday I read “Even The Dogs” by Jon McGregor. I’ve not quite finished it yet but that will at least prevent me from giving away spoilers. I am not sure I would want to give any spoilers anyway because it is unrelentingly grim so far. Perhaps there is a happy  ending but both you and I will have to read it to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to Jon McGregor by the book group I was part of during my PhD. I think “If Nobody Speaks Of Remarkable Things” was the first book I read for the group. At that time of my life, about eight or so years after finishing my English Literature A-level, I had not had to read a book that I had not chosen for myself for quite a long time. I found it to be a complete shock. I can still remember reading about half that book straight out of the amazon packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I had his next novel “So Many Ways To Begin” on my shelf unread for a while as I wrote up my PhD&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I finally got around to reading it once I’d finished my corrections. Reading a novel in the evenings after work is a unique pleasure, a kind of escapism that I am now long used to but new to me at the time&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a bittersweet love story that shows how unresolved issues in peoples’ lives can undermine and destroy relationships. I realised later when I re-read it that it contained numerous warnings that I should have heeded myself. All the best novels do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes McGregor’s novels stand out for me is the way that is able to get into his characters’ heads. The prose that he writes is a joyous cascade of thoughts tumbling out all over the page. It is remarkable how precisely he is able to match the rhythms and intonations of thoughts, though perhaps not surprising as the aim of the writer has long been to try and completely capture human experiences so that another might live them.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even The Dogs” is no exception. It begins with the discovery of a man’s body found in his
derelict flat and as the consequences of this unfold linearly, those who knew him explain how he came to be there and how their lives had become so intertwined and similarly ruined. This is all achieved using the thoughts and memories of the people involved, who are nearly all alcoholics and junkies so you get very disordered and chaotic descriptions of what went on. Sections of the prose often end mid-sentence and sometimes they repeat, folding over themselves, detailing the obsessions and thought processes of these people who have been pushed to the very furthest periphery of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel boils with both rage and sadness. The sections where characters remember sessions of talking therapy and interactions with case workers are seared with a sense of  incredulity both for the sincerity of those “there to help” and the fact that know they are there to “get another script”. The description of life on the street is as relentless and as bleak as you could hope to imagine, and is utterly convincing in its realisation. It made me realise that even in a society where no one should be homeless or hungry or left in the grip of drug or alcohol addiction, people do still fall through the cracks. I don’t feel qualified to say how I think these people should be helped. However, the way that you experience the pivot points in characters’ lives through their thoughts and memories made me realise that one of the best things that we can do is to prevent similar pivots happening in the lives of those people that we encounter. This is something I want to write about in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the subject matter, the book is not a pleasant read but because of the quality of the writing, it is thoroughly compelling. Here’s a short excerpt from page 108 of my copy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Waiting for the gear to cool in the syringe, and peeling back your clothes to find a vein. Stroking the skin on your arms, running cold steady fingers down the pulsing cords of your neck. Easing your trousers down and spreading your legs to find the bruised and scabbing entrance wounds along your fem. There, or there, or there. Hushed and holding your breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Waiting to feel the gear hit home, those long seconds between sticking in the pin and the gear doing what it does to your body and your brain and whatever else, your, fucking, soul. Waiting for all that pain to just get taken away. Wiped away, washed away. Or waiting for the meth to seep into you and get rid of that rattling for a few hours more, get rid of all the things that come up on you with the sickness. To hold you for the few hours while you work on getting sorted again. To keep the troubles away. The fucking troubles. The things that come to mind when you rather they didn’t come to mind, certain things. Certain things which if you’re not careful they all come pouring out the same way your guts come pouring out when you get sick, when you go too long without getting sorted. Comes pouring out of you. When you rather it didn’t. When rather none of it came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Waiting outside the chemist’s all them mornings, Mike and Danny and Heather and Laura and Bristol John, Stevie, Maggie, Ben, necking our little paper cups of meth, draining the thick green syrup and licking our lips and Mike going Eh now if it weren’t for this stuff there’d be a what’s it called a like uprising or insurrection or something you know what I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s the opium of the masses is what it is pal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His most recent book “This Isn’t The Sort Of Thing That Happens To Someone Like You” is a collection of short stories. It won’t be available in paperback until February next year but I will be eagerly picking up a copy when it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ah, the Waterstone’s 3 for 2, stealthily slipping books on to my shelves between 1999 and 2010. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Presumably my ability to distinguish between my PhD and a “proper job” points to a deep defect in my personality (or at least explains why it took me so long). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I feel a great urge to cite Proust and his madelines here but until I have taken my tanker trip around the world and read “A la recherche du temps perdu” I will resist this temptation. Or at the very least until I have read “Proust Was A Neuroscientist”. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Programming a Carcassonne Game</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/programming-a-carcassonne-game"/>
   <updated>2012-09-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/programming-a-carcassonne-game</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although I have put off finishing &lt;a href=&quot;programming-an-uno-game&quot;&gt;my UNO game&lt;/a&gt; for over eighteen months, I thought I would get started with another pet project of mine: making a Carcassonne game. This is not a serious affair, there is an excellent app of Carcassonne available for those of you who have iOS devices (it works particularly well on the iPad). The game just strikes me as having the right level of complexity to be a taxing yet attainable project. I’d also like to understand strategies for playing the game and what better way to evaluate strategies for games of chance than to have a simulator to play all those millions of games that you don’t have time to play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to have some rudimentary code ready for this post but it is misbehaving at the moment. I hope that it will be ready for another post in the next few days. That at least gives me an opportunity to explain the game in some detail, in case you have never played it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carcassonne is a tile game in which the aim is to build roads, cities, cloisters and fields, with the aim of having the most points by the time all the tiles have been laid. These are made by deploying little figures (affectionately known as meeple) on to a tile as it is laid. The tiles are supplied in random order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update April 2017: The original version of this post included a dummy playthrough of a Carcassonne game but there were several mistakes. I have plenty of notes for an additional post of this nature so more may appear on this topic at a later data, complete with a corrected playthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #20: Folklore by Nelly Furtado</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-20"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s rather spooky but shortly after deciding to write about Nelly Furtado’s “Folklore” as the next &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;understated classic&lt;/a&gt;, I found out that she has a new album out this week. As a result, I have been listening to a lot of her music while writing this post, and I’ve been enjoying it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always with these choices of mine, “Folklore” is a record that I can link to particular events and emotions in my life and so I guess my perception of it is coloured by that. Nevertheless while re-listening to the album I tried to examine whether my feelings for it were &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; centred on those memories and emotional responses. I think the answer is not a simple one, because in recent weeks I’ve felt very unsettled in many aspects of my life and so I probably have found it difficult to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that there are songs and ideas on this album that do stand the test of time, songs that we can go back to and say “yes, these are really good”, even if none of them make it into the “The Best Of Nelly Furtado Minimix” that can be found on spotify (as a mix, it’s hilariously bad):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album starts with “One Trick Pony” (“for you I will not dance and for you I will not prance”) and despite protestations to the contrary, she picks up from where “Whoah Nelly” left off with a glossy pop song and a positive vibe. It’s all banjos and finger picking before her wonderful soaraway voice takes up the chorus. The lyrics are about being strong and unique, and yet it has the same wistfulness that permeates through the whole album, something that is no doubt carried over from her Portuguese heritage (I often wonder if my own lusophilia started here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Powerless” picks up a similar mood and revisits that theme of identity and uniqueness from a different angle, namely the way that people are presented to the world in videos and magazines. If you think about how things like Facebook can make us feel like there is some great current to our lives that we have to go on with, this song explores the question of whether we should live the life that others expect of us, or do we live as we want to, as we feel we should. I can remember being galvanised many times by the line “because this life is too short to live it just for you”, even when the person I was thinking about was very much someone that I did just to live my life solely for. It’s strange now because it is “just a pop song” and I can sit there and think about how the banjo lines are almost the same as the previous track, but back then it seemed really important because it connected so well to the things that were preoccupying my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel less of a connection to the next song “Explode” but not because it isn’t heartfelt or because it doesn’t stir me, it is probably the most intensely personal song on the album, even if the events related in it might be fictional. It’s a song that looks back on teenage life and how the importance of things that happened in the past seem to change over time (“more than a battle scar / more than a battle scar / such a good good story to tell”). It helps that her pronunciation of “explode” makes that word sound like “explored” because that captures the duality of our teenage years very aptly, that simultaneous explosion into and exploration of the world around us. The ending (starting at “we’re counting the stars”) always gives me shivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead off single “Try” is probably the best song here, a love song about how perfection is not the most important thing in a relationship but that wanting the best for each other is. As a piece of pop ballad construction, it’s immaculate (complete with woozy “Mezzanine”-esque scratching), and if that maelstrom of an ending (including the lines “All of the things we want each other to be / We never will be / But that’s wonderful, that’s life”) doesn’t cut you up then maybe pop music isn’t really for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another nice thing about Nelly’s albums is that she includes some tracks in Portuguese (albeit she sang in Spanish on “Loose” and there’s nothing like that on the new album, but a Portuguese language album is apparently in the works). The two tracks like that on “Folklore” are “Fresh Off The Boat” and “Força”. Admittedly the first song only has a few lines in Portuguese at the end of the track and the second song only has a verse or two in Portuguese. “Força” was the theme song to Euro 2004, which was held in Portugal, but as with all these songs the references to football are rather forced and the song is a bit dreary. “Fresh Off The Boat” is at least an attempt to do something a little bit different and the attempt to address casual racism is a worthy one but apart from the sing-song lines in Portuguese, the elements don’t really stack up for me. (Perhaps I’m just being tetchy because I still can’t quite translate all of the lyrics, I should jfgi.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album is very much front-loaded (I tend to prefer albums this way) and so by halfway through the real peaks have passed. Nevertheless side two begins with three very decent tracks. “The Grass Is Green” is a simple ballad and, given the title, you probably could have written the lyrics but the quality is all in the delivery. As always, it is that voice that strains and soars into the choruses from out of the verses. The same is true of “Picture Perfect”, like “Explode” it wears personal experiences on its sleeve but unlike most ballads it doesn’t descend into histrionics. There’s a real and convincing sense of sadness and regret throughout and the musical arrangement is tidy, pretty but not fussy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More remarkable is “Saturdays”, which starts out as a sung poem backed up by acoustic guitar but later on a backing vocalist joins in and his enthusiasm threatens to overtake the whole song. At one point they start laughing and so you can tell that it is all done in one take. The lyrics are much darker and more mysterious than anything else on the album so although the zany one-take version is excellent, I can’t help but be curious about what it might have developed into if the recording on the album is, as I suspect, a demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album does tail away quite rapidly. “Build You Up” sits too close in the track list to “Grass Is Green” and “Picture Perfect” so it sounds a bit samey if you listen to the album in order, though it does stand out better on shuffle. “Island Of Wonder” features legendary singer Caetano Veloso and has a smoky trip-hop vibe, which is nice but not particularly remarkable. “Childhood Dreams” is rather gloopy and overlong, doing badly everything that “Picture Perfect” does well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-albums&quot;&gt;Other albums&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Spotify I finally managed to listen to Nelly’s 2009 Spanish language album “Mi Plan” and I really enjoyed it. It was much more like “Folklore” than it’s scattershot follow up “Loose”. For me the standout tracks were “Manos Al Aire” and “Baja Otra Luz”. I’d write a more detailed review but I only understood about 30% of the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Loose” hasn’t got any better with age. It basically fuses two ideas, namely “I can write half decent songs” and “Let’s go hip-hop!”, and then proceeds to cock up both. Nevertheless there’s still some good stuff: “Afraid”, “Promiscuous”, “In God’s Hands” and “All Good Things”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will write about the new album in the album digest at the end of the month. It’s more like “Loose” than “Folklore” but it is a bit more cohesive. More info to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, August 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Album Digest August 2012 is also from the stack of albums that I &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-july-2012&quot;&gt;mentioned last month&lt;/a&gt;. I chose this selection (along with the Passion Pit album) because the colours looked good together in the mosaic of covers that I make each month. Last month’s digest was about the right amount of detail so this will be another briefer digest. These are all good albums but not ones that will change your life, they’ll just happily sit alongside it. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laurel Halo &lt;em&gt;Quarantine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grimes &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auntie Flo &lt;em&gt;Future Rhythm Machine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passion Pit &lt;em&gt;Gossamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, there’s a playlist at the end but this month it’s in Spotify as I wasn’t able to find any free MP3s of songs from the Passion Pit album. Note also that I write this post while deaf in one ear, so if my descriptions sound skewiff that might be why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;laurel-halo-quarantine&quot;&gt;Laurel Halo “Quarantine”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first listened to this album in June and to be totally honest, I was a little underwhelmed. I think I was too perturbed by the artwork featuring Japanese manga schoolgirls committing sepakku surrounded by rainbows. The interior is worse with cartoon guts unspooling everywhere: it makes me feel queasy. After a while I understood how well that queasiness sits with the sound of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs on “Quarantine” explore how the cognitive dissonance of listening to songs that are simultaneously beautiful and ugly. At least that is how it seems the first few times. As I became more familiar with the album, the songs seemed to be either match-ups of either a pretty vocal combined with grizzly challenging backing, or a dissonant unappealing vocal paired with pretty blissed-out atmospherics. Towards the end of the album on “Light+Space” this formula changes and all the appealing elements appear together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With repeated listens I found that many of the elements that I had dismissed as ugly (e.g. the vocal on “Years”) were actually complementing the prettier elements. I got more used to her voice and her sound the more I listened to the album. I began to really enjoy it. “Thaw”, “MK Ultra” and the aforementioned “Light+Space” are my favourite tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grimes-visions&quot;&gt;Grimes “Visions”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another album with a cover that might put you off. There’s an alien head and the track titles are all weird. It’s as though there is a deliberate attempt to mask just how fun this album is! It’s the poppiest album I have heard all year. It’s hard to believe that music this poppy isn’t being beamed into all the places where we could possibly hear music. It’s that good. For now though it isn’t and so &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is still a private party inside my own head. I urge you to track down a copy and join in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Genesis”, the first full length song on the album, has a riff that sounds a bit like Kraftwerk’s “Trans Europe Express” and a vocal that sounds like an Enya record back from 1991. You won’t believe this but Enya was pretty cool back in 1991. She made concept albums about Saturn’s rings. The Kraftwerk-Enya combo seems way too corny to work but it does. The words are completely indecipherable and yet “Genesis” is still a massive ear worm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not convinced? What about “Vowels = Space and Time”, which sounds like the songs that Madonna was trying to make all those years when she tried to be cool? A sinuous vocal winds around a funky synth line and it just works. This is the sort of pop music the world needs but rarely gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My absolute favourite is “Be A Body”. I love the short and simple lyric (entire first verse: “I close my eyes until I see / I don’t need hands to touch me / Be a body”) but the best bit is the enormous beat that kicks in at 2:00. It’s a song that relies on repetition and layering and these are things that I respond well to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall “Visions” is a fabulous maze of an album. It’s full of little of dead ends and intricate details, yet never forgets the sheer pleasure of pop vocals and chunky beats. Many albums these days are po-faced and overly serious but “Visions” is a welcome reminder that albums can still be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;auntie-flo-future-rhythm-machine&quot;&gt;Auntie Flo “Future Rhythm Machine”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One joy of the &lt;a href=&quot;can-the-lost-tapes&quot;&gt;CAN “Lost Tapes” box set&lt;/a&gt; is a little track called &lt;em&gt;E.F.S. 108&lt;/em&gt;. The acronym stands for “Ethnological Forgery Series”, a knowing nod to the creation of exotic-sounding but nonetheless fake ‘ethnic’ music for a western audience. Whether music constructed in this fashion is more or less authentic than music that appropriates existing recordings via sampling is a debate for another day. (One that will in fact be sparked by a forthcoming understated classic, believe it or not.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously I say all this because “Future Rhythm Machine” also seems subject to this debate. The main features of the album are a set of world-straddling driving beats spannning the distance from London to Rio and then back over to Africa. I feel embarrassed that I don’t know more about afrobeat to be more precise with the geography. It also has a similarly diverse set of vocals. Exceptionally, it is also really concise despite its breadth of influences and underlying energy. I often write in these digests that I like an album that fits entirely in to my walk to work. The album is thirty five minutes long, a party that makes you happy and doesn’t over stay its welcome. Perfect for that walk to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not all worldbeat. The last two tracks span a third of the album’s short running time and sound completely different to the rest. Both instrumentals and have a more experimental feel that tapers off the album in a satisfying fashion. “Train” owes a debt to “Different Trains” by Steve Reich and “Futurismo” also has a minimalist vibe. The latter perhaps has too many layers and is too melodic to be confused with a Philip Glass piece, but it does have a very similar insistent pulse. I only mention the change in style because of the short length of the album. Did they run out of ideas? I hope not because I would like to hear more stuff by these guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passion-pit-gossamer&quot;&gt;Passion Pit “Gossamer”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep deriding the maximalist sound of Rustie’s “Glass Swords” album but Passion Pit’s “Gossamer” gives those same maximalist tendencies a run at the pop mainstream. I say mainstream but &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossamer_(album)#Charts&quot;&gt;the peak UK chart position of “Gossamer” was number 56&lt;/a&gt;. For an album of melodramatic pop songs that chart the fall of a relationship, the maximal approach works really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening track “Take A Walk” is a highlight, charting a whole life story in four and a half minutes. It tells a tale of an immigrant family who end up undone by their ambitions. I’ve adopted it as the sound track to my summer because of my fondness for choruses with an “oh oh oh” line. I have probably mentioned this fondness before. I really like “Carried Away” because its cheeky tale of postgraduate seduction reminds me of PhD days (albeit with rose tinted lenses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, too much psychological damage is in evidence for the whole album to truly be a comfortable listen. Examples include lines like: “I drink a gin and take a couple of my pills” (“I’ll Be Alright”); “And now I’m drunker than before, they told me drinking doesn’t make me nice” (“Constant Conversations”); “Yes I drank all those drinks on my own / My life’s become some blurry little quest” (“Cry Like A Ghost”); and “Sorry I couldn’t be there, I was tied to a rocking chair / I was beat down to a pulp rocking back and forth somewhere” (“It’s Not My Fault I’m Happy”). I think albums which explore the break up of relationships are always going to be pretty raw for me and this one seems rawer than most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, “Gossamer” is as a well-produced set of dark songs that glow in the shadows of uncomfortably colourful illuminations. I have a feeling that apart from “Take A Walk” I may have forgotten all about this album by this time next year. I hope not.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #19: The Dreaming by Kate Bush</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-19"/>
   <updated>2012-08-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-19</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I see the people working and see it working for them.” (&lt;em&gt;Sat In Your Lap&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dreaming by Kate Bush is a strange 1982 album that many believed had destroyed her career. Two weeks before her first ever performance of “Running Up That Hill”, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;amp;title=on_this_day_kate_bush_releases_hounds_of_1986&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&amp;amp;tb=1&amp;amp;pb=1&quot;&gt;the NME had written an editorial asking whether she had burnt herself out completely&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously “Running Up That Hill” (recently used to great effect in the Olympic Closing Ceremony) and the parent album “The Hounds Of Love” that followed showed that she had plenty more up her sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless there is little doubt that back in 1982 “The Dreaming” would have sounded very bizarre indeed. There are songs about S&amp;amp;M, suicide bombings, stalkers, and a song about smugglers that I used to think was about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart&quot;&gt;Amelia Earhart&lt;/a&gt;. One song is about the genocidal displacement of Australia’s aboriginal peoples sung in an Australian accent, while another is a music hall spoof about a failed bank robbery. At first listen it is extremely strange and yet on repeat listens it is probably the best album in her discography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush’s previous album “Never For Ever” contained great songs like “Army Dreamers” and “Breathing”. The latter was probably Bush’s first excursion into telling stories with music as well as sound. Apparently the recording of all the titular breathing and whooping and wheezing that closes out the song (one of my favourites) convinced the head of EMI that pornography was being recorded and he demanded an explanation! Suits huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound adventures of “Never For Ever” would continue in “The Dreaming” with Kate taking over all production duties. The results is a patchwork of styles with disembodied voices and samples and alternative vocal lines swooping all over the songs. The distinctive sound of the Fairlight synthesiser, popular and novel at the time, features throughout and while it sounds a little dated now, it colours rather than details the songs - giving them a period filter rather than a period costume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first track was also the first single, “Sat In Your Lap”. It is a song that I have always enjoyed, about how you approach learning new things. Specifically that tension between the pleasure of finding out new things and the time that it takes to learn. It’s something that I feel all the time. I really like the vocal arrangement in this track and the way that she sets herself up as her own back singers. The ending is typical Kate Bush but nothing like you’d find anywhere else, a weird list of directions to knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite song on the album is “There Goes A Tenner”. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/54728/&quot;&gt;A post about the song on songmeanings.net makes for rather interesting reading&lt;/a&gt;, I had no idea it was so subversive. Personally I don’t think that you can read that much into the song, it seems to me like a fun bit of genre imitation with a bit of a Ska and Music Hall hybrid. That said “Cloudbusting” has a really wonderfully subtext about a ‘scientist’ who believes he can create orgasms and control the weather all told from the view point of his gay son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is “Pull Out The Pin”, a song inspired by a documentary about the Vietnam war. As you might expect, it’s fairly tough going. It adds to my suspicion of whether “There Goes A Tenner” can really have such a dark subtext when it is such a throwaway arrangement. There’s some really interesting percussion in this song that subtly underlines the war theme with a hint of martiality. In the extended outro there is also a guitar line that echoes Tom Waits’ “Shore Leave” from the “Swordfishtrombones” album. I think that deep down though the subtext here is a relationship (“Just one thing in it / Me or him”) and whether to surrender one’s individuality for the sake of a partner (“…but I love life / I love life…”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With “Suspended In Gaffa” it is my turn to find darker meanings when there probably isn’t one. The users of that  song meanings website claim that it’s about the impatience of being an artist (echoing “Sat In Your Lap” I guess) or being in purgatory (that interpretation baffles me). I think it’s about bondage, there I said it. Perhaps I am being too literal in how I understand all the lines about gaffa but also lines like “not till I am ready for you” and “can I have it all now” seem to be dripping with innuendo if you ask me… ooh Matron!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to sit down and specifically listen to “Leave It Open” in order to be able to write something about it. It is one of those songs on even the best of albums that just drifts by. It is about self control, in particular about whether we hurt people when it is within our capability (“Harm in us / the power to harm”) and like many of the songs on the album it takes the form of a dialogue between what are presumably different aspect of the narrator’s personality. Meanwhile from a production point of view it lays the ground for better songs like “The Big Sky” and “Mother Stands For Comfort” which would follow on the next album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title track, as I mentioned earlier, is sung in an Australian accent and features a didgeridoo. It’s a far better song than that (admittedly rather snarky) description would suggest though it is certainly very odd. Even against the other songs on the album it is rather strange. I like it a lot for the little Fairlight noises you can hear mingling in with all the didgeridoos and aboriginal noises, it’s a really atmospheric, almost theatrical, piece of music. It’s about aborigines being cleared out from land in Australia and it doesn’t pull any punches. It is also indicative of the burgeoning interest in what would become known as “world music” in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Dreaming” leads into “Night Of The Swallow” with a somewhat incongruous jig before settling into a ballad, the only one on this album. A woman pleads with her man not to go off (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Swallow_(song)&quot;&gt;smuggling, according to wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) to do something dangerous as she fears for what might happen if he does. As the song ends, the jig resumes and it goes by at a fair clip for a ballad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All My Love” features choir voices that sound as though they have been processed through the Fairlight, creating a spooky atmosphere. A similar trick would be employed on “Snowflake”, the opening track of “50 Words For Snow”. The song has a really nice bass line that sounds like something off a Pink Floyd record and the samples of answer phone messages add to the atmosphere, it still sounds like a modern record today. You could argue that “All My Love” is the prototype for many of the songs on “The Sensual World” and “The Red Shoes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Houdini” tells the story of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Houdini&quot;&gt;the famous illusionist&lt;/a&gt; from the point of view of his wife. The rather traumatic lines (“With my spit / still on your lips / you hit the water”) are delivered in a way that make the song quite challenging, it’s one of those “oh she’s bonkers” deliveries that Kate Bush got lumbered with long before Björk announced herself to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, “Get Out Of My House” is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jun/22/rereading-stephen-king-the-shining&quot;&gt;“The Shining”&lt;/a&gt;. I always thought it was about stalkers but “The Shining” makes more sense. It probably should have been a single because it is a wonderfully batty song and “get out of my house” is a great lyric to sing along to (better than “Bang goes another kanga on the bonnet of the van” anyway). There is yet another great vocal arrangement, the samples and backing vocals all layer over each other in ways that are both intimate and frightening. On headphones it sounds like when someone stands to close to your ear and hums something that makes your spine squirm. It must have sounded totally crazy at the start of the eighties but after “The Hounds Of Love” it would have made much more sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, “The Dreaming” is a great little album (43 minutes) and while some of it sounds a little dated today, it has aged well because of the great production. I think it is the easiest album to go to listen to all the way through, though the weird “Ninth Wave” side of “The Hounds Of Love” is not without its rewards (even if it does often put me off) and there are songs on “The Dreaming” that can’t be found on “The Whole Story” which is my favourite of her compilations (it’s deleted now).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nick Harkaway, The Gone-Away World</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-gone-away-world"/>
   <updated>2012-08-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-gone-away-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“The Gone-Away World” is a novel by Nick Harkaway. It’s about a world slightly askew to our own in which the powers-that-be have deigned to unleash a weapon that simply wipes the enemy out of existence. Unfortunately the enemies also have the same weapon and there are terrible consequences to the extent that the very fabric of reality is threatened. If you don’t already know what reification means, you will by the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without giving away too many plot points, I think the central themes are about how absolute power corrupts absolutely and the weird relationships that we have with our self-image and how we perceive those around us. Throughout you get the pervading sense that “the road to hell is paved with good intentions”. No opportunity to swipe at figures of authority or bureaucracy is missed. As an example here is an excerpt from the near the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Dick Washburn, known forevermore as Dickwash, is a type D pencilneck: a sassy wannabe paymaster with vestigial humanity. This makes him vastly less evil than a type B pencilneck (heartless bureaucratic machine, pro-class tennis) and somewhat less evil than a type C pencilneck (chortling lackey of the dehumanising system, ambient golf), but unquestionably more evil than pencilneck types M through E (real human screaming to escape a soul-devouring professional persona, varying degrees of desperation). No one I know has ever met the type A pencilneck, in much the same way that no one ever reports their own fatal accident; a type A pencilneck would be a person so entirely consumed in which he or she is employed that they had ceased to exist as a separate entity. They would be odourless, faceless and undetectable, without ambition or restraint, and would take decisions unfettered by human concerns, make choices for the company, of the company. A type A pencilneck would be the kind of person to sign off on torture and push the nuclear button for no more pressing reason than that it was his job - or hers - and it seemed the next logical step.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, this reminds me of a line from “Gravity’s Rainbow” by Thomas Pynchon (more on this stupendous novel in the near future I promise):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…a million bureaucrats are diligently plotting death and some of them even know it…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot itself hinges on a marvellous surprise about two-thirds of the way through the book, a brilliant little narrative manoeuvre that turns a highly enjoyable book into one that makes you go “whoa I haven’t read anything this good in ages”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the best books are those where the author is in complete command of his characters and his story. I was a bit unsure after the first chapter but once it all kicks in (with a hilarious story about blowing up some ice that unfortunately is too long to quote here) it becomes a rich tale about a world slightly off-kilter from ours and a terrible war that should not have been fought. Meanwhile the author throws the timeline of the story around in a really competent and engaging way, folding the back story and the ongoing action together so that although the action goes back and forth you always know where you are, even if you don’t always know where you are going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to read but not for want of excitement or enjoyment. It’s a deceptively long novel and I paced myself to get the most out of it. While I didn’t find myself reading it at 3AM like I did China Miéville’s “Perdido Street Station” or Neal Stephenson’s “Anathem”, I did find myself losing hours at a stretch to this touching yet comic story. I highly recommend it and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Angelmaker-Vintage-Contemporaries-Nick-Harkaway/dp/0307743624/ref=tmm_pap_title_0&quot;&gt;will be looking for his new novel “Angelmaker” once it is out in paperback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of fiction I think the next one for me is “The Marriage Plot” by Jeffrey Eugenides.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, July 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-july-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-07-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-july-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a short album digest this month. I bought a stack of CDs and am parcelling them out over the next few months (together with important additional releases as they crop up). This is in the hope that I can write more considered pieces about each one. This month I’ve grouped together albums with monochrome covers and a BT album from June that I found out about recently. These albums are not just linked by their artwork, they also form a cohesive whole. As a result I dispense with reviewing each album in depth. As usual there is a playlist at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the four albums of Album Digest July 2012:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BT “If The Stars Are Eternal So Are You And I”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actress “R.I.P”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monolake “Ghosts”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mohn “Mohn”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;into-the-grey&quot;&gt;Into The Grey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What unites these albums is a moody, glitchy strain of electronica. You will note from the hero image the rather monochrome nature of each album’s artwork. The music on the albums is pretty monochrome too, not that I mean this as criticism. Just that for the most part they are intense pieces with hidden depths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with the BT album.&lt;/strong&gt; “If The Stars Are Eternal So Are You And I” is one half of a larger whole in two ways. First, BT released another album on the same day. The companion album “Morceau Subrosa” is a 46 minute piece consisting of a single track. This sounds a bit too experimental for me. If I can get it cheap or, better still, find it on Spotify, I will give it a go. “If The Stars Are Eternal So Are You And I” is also similar to earlier BT album “This Binary Universe”. Both are over 75 minutes long and consist of seven tracks that are, on average, 13 minutes long. On release “This Binary Universe” was something of an anomaly, an album of expansive ambient tracks featuring both a classical sensibility and more abstract use of the hissing, stuttering ‘transforms’ that give BT’s mainstream releases their power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This Binary Universe” is a successful experiment and is well-liked among BT fans (myself included). The notion of a ‘sequel’ or at least another album with a similar structure is appealing to me. The problem, as with many sequels and follow-ups, is that familiarity with the earlier material colours your perception of the new tracks. What I say here may be subject to that. “This Binary Universe” is a great album to have a nap to and in this respect “If The Stars Are Eternal So Are You And I” is an even greater success. While there are satisfying sections that throb and pound as much as the best of his material, the majority of the album is sedate. “Seven-Hundred-Thirty-Nine” and the middle section of final track “The Gathering Darkness” are the more upbeat moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is a satisfying swirl of electronica with quiet generative drones glitching away through tracks like “13 Angels On My Broken Windowsill”. There is a nice bit of transform heavy trad-BT in the middle of the same track and a few wub-wub-wubs for brostep fans (cf Skrillex). There is a pleasant generative feel to the clicks and pads of “Go(D)T”. It’s dark and reminiscent of Biosphere, a hearty recommendation round here. Parts of the album lack conviction, from about forty minutes in there are bits that twinkle and busy themselves with sounding like soundtrack music rather than being interesting in their own right. “The Gathering Darkness” is a satisfying closing track but I was disappointed by the ending. For the last two minutes it seemed like the album might be a closed loop and fade nicely into the first track. Unfortunately, putting the album on repeat all reveals that this is not the case. Another idea of lists for things to do on my own albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Actress album&lt;/strong&gt; is smoother though the title track shuffles into your speakers with a satifying glitchiness too. I  admit that I was a bit non-plussed by his previous album “Splazsh”. At one point I mentioned that I might put it in an album digest last year but I never ended up doing so. As much as I did an injustice to the SBTRKT album last year by constantly comparing its tracks to those of 808 State, I may do the same with this album. Tracks like “Ascending” and “Caves Of Paradise” sound very similar to Four Tet to me, while the more jazzy slow-paced tracks like “Uriel’s Black Harp” and “Jardin” remind me of tracks by Fridge from a decade ago. These comparisons are not unfavourable, at least not for me, it just confuses me when I read reviews elsewhere that claim it is something entirely novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may not agree that “R.I.P.” is completely novel and mind-blowing, but it is good. The throb of “Marble Plexus” is massive and has a very satisfying heft to it, both through speakers and headphones. I also like the squirming “N.E.W”, which shifts and drifts through its five and a half minute run time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monolake&lt;/strong&gt; is an alter ego of German electronica whizz Robert Henke. “Ghosts” is the second in a planned trilogy of albums. I haven’t heard part one but  part two is pretty brutal. The title track roars out of the speakers, all clattering snares, wobbling bass, and a vocal sample that sounds like one of Kraftwerk’s robots on the worst acid trip ever. It’s all tetch, twitch and tech. Henke is one of those people who are incredibly anal about the sound quality of particular formats (his comments about vinyl are particularly cute) and while I don’t have the ears to compare formats, you can tell that every detail  has been meticulously prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second track “Toku”, which is even scarier, is an airy elemental track that is all footsteps and bumps in the night. It builds on strange rattles and eerie heartbeats. When I listen to it while walking home it lends every element of the environment a sinister portent - the glowering skies, the wind in the trees, the looming tower blocks of the police college - all of them combine with this music to freak me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like “If The Stars Are Eternal So Are You And I”, “Ghosts” is an album to be taken as a whole. By about halfway, individual tracks seem more like facets of the same overall sound-world and after “Toku” only “The Existence Of Time” and closing track “Foreign Object” really stand out for me. The former is a hyperactive time trial of a track. I am going to overuse my Kraftwerk references and ask you to imagine how an album that was the nightmarish evil twin of Kraftwerk’s “Tour de France Soundtracks” might sound. Meanwhile, on Henke’s website there is a funny story about “Foreign Object” came into existence. Apparently he produced the track on the same evening as the final master of the album was created. I think I can hear that in it, it is looser and more fun (weird monk noises!) than what goes before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final album &lt;strong&gt;“Mohn”&lt;/strong&gt; is also German, a collaboration between Wolfgang Voigt and Jörg Burger, two stars of the continental electronic music scene. I’ve heard of the former but not the later. Fun fact: Mohn means Poppy in German. Initially “Mohn” is not that much different from “Ghosts”, first track “Einrauschen” is a clamour of static and drone. It is not dissimilar to anything on the Monolake album or the first few minutes of “13 Angels On My Broken Windowsill”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the album warms up as it progresses, which was a pleasant surprise. The second track “Schwarzer Schwan” is friendlier than the first, with simulated choirs and warm tones before a rather slow beat stomps in, backed up by a chunky synth. These elements layer over one another as the track progresses, all weird and otherworldly, but nowhere near as oppressive as the Monolake tracks. By contrast “Ambientôt” is positively chummy, a charming synth lilting over light drums and gently rocking back and forth for five minutes. Some hypnotic guitar riffs are layered on before the track eventually fades away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first three tracks “Mohn” strikes for the middle ground. “Saturn” is a hypnotic and upbeat track that ambles along in a jolly and soothing way for eight minutes. With the glitch of “Einrauschen” long gone, the remaining half hour is unthreatening and equally pleasant as “Saturn”. It sounds like a mid-period Orb album but without the annoying samples. A special mention goes to the lovely “Ebertplatz 2020”. I have included it on the accompanying playlist simply because it is lovely. “Mohn” is easy to listen to and like “If The Stars Are Eternal So Are You And I” very easy to have a nap to. This is probably why I have listened to it so much this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next month:&lt;/strong&gt; Laurel Halo, Grimes, Auntie Flo, and Passion Pit.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, June 2012</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three fantastic albums for Album Digest June 2012:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saint Etienne &lt;em&gt;Words and Music by Saint Etienne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;WIXIW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hot Chip &lt;em&gt;In Our Heads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month is a curious selection in that the albums are all by bands that I already own a few records by. When there is so much other directly related material that you can write about, it makes focussing on the album in hand quite difficult. I am always thinking up rankings and comparisons. Where does this new album fit in with the rest of them? Will I like it as much when the novelty wears off? What would it sound like if they had done Y or Z like they did back on album X?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole “feeling a bit guilty about no new artists” thing was alleviated a little when the monthly Fabric CD plopped through the letter-hole, as Guy Gerber’s mix is a wonderfully egotistical one composed entirely of his own tracks. He is not the first Fabric mixer to do this but it was fortunate as it gave me an album of new music by an artist I’d not heard of before to listen to. Unfortunately I don’t know the genre well and opportunities for listening to a seventy-odd minute slab of throbbing electronic music were shamefully few and far between this month. I had to downgrade it to an “honourable mention” at the end of the post, though I include two of the tracks in the mix right at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saint-etienne-words-and-music-by-saint-etienne&quot;&gt;Saint Etienne &lt;em&gt;Words and Music by Saint Etienne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This could be my life / This could save my life.” (&lt;em&gt;Tonight&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After their comprehensive reissue series, it seemed as though Saint Etienne had bowed out, giving away tracks from the vaults as part of a victory lap. Instead they appear to have galvanised themselves into producing a magnificent concept album about our love affair with the pop single. All the songs on “Words And Music” present a very personal take on pop music, identifying the ability of the genre to produce songs that listeners can internalise and make a part of their lives. They do this with songs that epitomise these same features. On “Tonight” Sarah sings “this could be my life / this could save my life / … I can hardly wait” and this captures the thesis of the entire album: how even the most simple and seemingly throwaway music can underpin and reinforce our inner emotional lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a grand project, summarised at the outset by “Over The Border” a spoken word pean to popular music that spans childhood, adolescence and adulthood. I arrived too late to be a collector of the vinyl that is so fetishised here but I felt as strong a bond to my cassettes. I think of that recent Facebook meme featuring a photo of a cassette and a biro with the caption “Share if you know the connection between these two objects”. I also fell in love with a glamourous adult, namely Marie out of Roxette, though neither I nor my friends made the trek to Sweden to see her house, unlike the friends of the song’s narrator that head “to Somerset to see Peter Gabriel’s house”. The song continues through going to gigs and making mix tapes for loved ones, right up to falling in love and wondering whether “when I am married and have kids, will Marc Bolan still be as important”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs that follow “Over The Border” are sequenced to retell its story again through songs. There is definitely a great musical to made from this narrative, especially if they throw in a few of the other great Saint Etienne singles — it could be like “Mamma Mia” but with more references to seeing the KLF on Top Of The Pops last night. Talking of singles, this album is jammed packed with potential singles. This is perhaps unsurprising for an album that is a full on tribute to the joys of pop singles and most Saint Etienne albums do effortlessly knock off at least three solid gold singles, which would be useful to them if the charts still mattered I guess. On “Words And Music” I can count six, maybe even seven, potential singles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these songs are produced to perfection, primed right for the pleasure spot that either gets you up dancing or sets you down to ruminate up the past, mostly the former. There is “I Got Your Music”, a love song to the joy of listening to mix tapes on headphones; “Heading For The Fair”, a song about a first love tinged with candy floss and the whip of the waltzer; “Tonight”, a call to make music the most important thing in your life — even if for just one night; “Popular”, featuring a break up made less painful by nineties dance records; “DJ”, a song about finding and losing love on the dance floor; “25 Years”, which examines encroaching mortality in morbid close-up through the life spans of music genres and their stars; and “When I Was Seventeen” with its telling line “When I was seventeen I thought I knew everything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact I now feel a bit guilty for not listing all the songs because the remainders are hardly filler, they are just deeper and take a little longer to sneak themselves under your skin. “Last Days Of Disco” seems like a cheesy genre pastiche at first but after a few listens becomes one of those wonderful songs about just dancing and being in the moment for the sake of love, one of those songs that you only ever hear at weddings because a) nobody makes songs like that any more and b) no one really dances to get lost in the moment any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot recommend this album enough. It is my favourite of the year so far and I find it hard to imagine what kind of record might top it. If you need cheering up and if you need your faith in love and music need to be restored, you could do worse than giving this little gem a try. The wonderfully witty cover art will give you plenty to look at too but avoid the version with the bonus disc of remixes - they really aren’t worth it. Here’s the video for “Tonight”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;liars-wixiw&quot;&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;WIXIW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Tie me up in a red ribbon / Teach me how to be a person.” (&lt;em&gt;Flood To Flood&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It always feels like you damn an album with faint praise when you write something like “it sent me back to the such and such album and I really enjoyed it”. That though is my opening gambit for discussing “WIXIW”, the latest album by Liars. It sent me scurrying back to their second and third albums “They Were Wrong So We Drowned” and “Drum’s Not Dead”, two albums that I loved even though I’ve preferred number four and five for casual listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the nostalgic trip back to Liars’ weirder albums is that “WIXIW” is another of their curveballs - taking the simple structure of their songs, pretty much gutting the rhythm section (at least at first listen) and replacing it with electronics. One of the reviews said “Underworld fronted by Lou Reed” and I’m inclined to agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking out most of the rhythm section is rather brave. You can argue that as a three-piece, Liars are pretty much all rhythm section. Going back to drowned and drums, I was struck by how both albums were defined by drums and grooves. drowned in particular is a difficult album to get on with (Rolling Stone famously scored it 1/10 but what do they know?) but it is the rhythmic rhythmic elements that save it: see “Broken Witch”, “There’s Always Room On The Broom” and “They Don’t Want Your Corn, They Want Your Kids”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, listening back to “Drum’s Not Dead” I can remember thinking at the time of its release just how close they were to being an electronic band. Tracks like “The Wrong Coat For You Mt. Heart Attack” are actually quite similar to those on “WIXIW” and the reason that the new album made much more sense after revisiting “Drum’s…” is that they approach the same space - a sort of haunted minimalism - from different angles. On one side you have squally guitar feedback and echoing drums, on the other rippling electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question is whether all this striving for context means that I’m trying to disguise the fact that the songs on “WIXIW” are a bit weak. I can’t lie, they took a while to convince me. The opening song “The Exact Colour Of Doubt” (fantastic title!) is a beautiful mirage and instantly shows how using electronics really works with the Liars sound while “Octagon” demonstrates that the drums aren’t dead on this record either. “No. 1 Against The Rush” is probably the easiest Liars track to get along with since “Plaster Casts Of Everything”, despite it being pretty much it’s polar opposite. “A Ring On Every Finger” proves that transplanting the rhythm section into the electronics works well with the pretty chant vocal it is another accessible track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By about four or five songs in, the true genius of “WIXIW” is revealed - this is a Liars album that is constructed completely differently from the five other Liars albums, albums that themselves are each distinct from one another. Moreover, this distinctiveness is achieved with songs that are among the most accessible that they have written. What is even more special is that this accessibility is achieved without making the songs boring or dumb. Even Radiohead have difficulty doing this sometimes and can’t do it as well as Liars do (perhaps because Radiohead have to carry a larger audience with them as they go).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title track is pretty dense, the murky centre of an album that is as palindromic in sound as its title. “Flood To Flood” stands out as the best track on the album and contains the lyric “tie me up in a red ribbon / teach me how to be a person”, which could be as much an allusion to a flow of blood as it could be the description of a beautiful red bow. “Who Is The Hunter?” is one of the few Liars songs that you can say has a beautiful vocal, not to mention that it also has a beat that would have sat very nicely on the Hot Chip album. Contrary to the last, “Brats” is the most rumbustious of the songs on the record but is sequestered away near to the end of the record. The final song “Annual Moon Words” is uncharacteristically folky and practically acoustic, disappearing with a “Ping!” noise just as it’s getting going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Liars” and “Sisterworld” were albums that proved that Liars could produce direct and comprehensible songs using their sound, “WIXIW” evolves that sound and shows that with those difficult second and third albums they weren’t actually looking for a sound, they’d already found one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a pretty but rather dark video for “No. 1 Against The Rush”. It annoys me because I watched it and at the start there’s this fat old guy getting dressed for a night out. Within about three seconds I’d thought “I bet he’s a serial killer and he kidnaps all the members of the band before a suitably ambiguous ending that reflects the intangible resolution of the song itself”. And guess what? The guy turned out to be a serial killer who kidnaps all the members of the band before a suitably ambiguous ending that reflects the intangible resolution of the song itself. Boring. So I am going to link to this spooky trailer for the album instead that has people trying to pronounce the album’s title:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hot-chip-in-our-heads&quot;&gt;Hot Chip &lt;em&gt;In Our Heads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I know it’s nothing more than flutes / But something in my heart is loose.” (&lt;em&gt;Flutes&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like only yesterday that “The Warning” completely blew me away after I had bought it purely on the basis of its cover art. We are now up to album number five all of a sudden (though I did join in at number two) and Hot Chip are now a really important band in my life. The fact that I have already discussed two side project albums by members of the band in album digests this year (“Be Strong” by The 2 Bears in &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-january-2012&quot;&gt;January&lt;/a&gt; and “Yesterday Was Lived and Lost” by New Build in &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-march-2012&quot;&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;) is another measure of this. Despite those side projects, they have now delivered albums (roughly every two years or so) and the liner notes claim that this one was recorded in just two months at the end of last year and the start of this one. I think it is remarkable that a band with such a strong work ethic still produces such consistent and interesting albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole “In Our Heads” is a bit safer than previous albums but it doesn’t dip in quality at the end like “Made In The Dark” and it doesn’t go missing in the middle like “One Life Stand”. In fact it is the most satisfying Hot Chip album to listen to all the way through since “The Warning”. The joys of that album were its scattershot approach to genre and allowing bursts of emotion to pop up in unexpected places; “In Our Heads” is more measured, assuredly navigating changes in pace and emotion throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard “Motion Sickness”, I was walking home from work in the rain and the way it built slowly into a weird trumping tuba bass line and then into a typical Hot Chip song made me really happy. It may or may not be about the changes in how we listen to music (see sample lyrics: “Remember when we both first heard / that wall of sound, that wall of sound?” and “There’s a world of entertainment in your head”). The positive vibe continues on “How Do You Do”, a bouncy number with a fantastic lilting vocal arrangement and great lyrics about the healing power of love (“A heart is not breaking / it’s for beating out all the life that needs to begin”) and faith (“A church is not praying / it’s for celebrating the light that shines through the pain”). There are few choruses more uplifting than you make me want to live again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the upbeat start the tempo decreases a bit with “Don’t Deny Your Heart”, which starts in an early-90s-pop kind of way (Hello SongPop!) before settling into a lyric about offering love and friendship to the people you meet. The tempo may be dropping but the positive vibes are not! Meanwhile, “Look At Where We Are” is the slowie, a soppy song that would be way too mawkish were it not for the delightfully wry sampled voices making a chorus of disjointed “oh” noises in the background. It is sappy but it doesn’t overstay its welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace begins to increase again with “These Chains”, a song that is probably as soppy as “Look At Where We Are”. It is the only song on the album that disappoints me because I think that more could have been made of the slightly creepy subtext of lyrics like “these chains/you’ve bound around my heart/complete me baby/I would not be free”. Mind you, it might have undermined the whole mood of the album if they had done that. The same is true of “Night And Day”, a song about getting it night and day that also has to tow a fine line - this time between cheekiness and outright raunch. There’s a tension in lines like “If I could be inside you baby / in the centre of your life” that’s not so subtle. To prevent things from getting too hot under the collar (or to send things over the top in a completely different direction) there’s a cute little non sequitur rap in the middle that had me asking myself “Do I look like a rapper?” in the shower each morning for about a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is “Flutes” which is my favourite of all the songs on the album. It builds for 1:38 on top of some thumping techno and a sample that sounds like a playground chant. It has an indecipherable chant chorus that I always join in with, I just make up the words as I go along. It stretches out over seven luxurious minutes and not one is wasted. The best thing about the song is the contrast to the rest of the album in being a song that derives its meaning and emotional punch mostly from the dynamics of the musical arrangement and the production, rather than the lyrics and their delivery. Sometimes it is better not to explain things and just head for the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After “Flutes” the album settles back into its song-based with “Now There Is Nothing” which relaxes on a funky strut that is enlivened by key and tempo changes. I think it suffers a little in comparison to “Flutes” but it is a fine song that reminds me of The Beatles, though I cannot put my finger on why. The start of “Ends Of The Earth” reminds me of their Kraftwerk remixes but with a splash of an 80s Pet Shop Boys 12” mix thrown in for good measure. Like “Flutes” it builds steadily for a significant proportion of its runtime before introducing the main vocal but the song that emerges is more straightforward, a simple request for compassion from a lovelorn admirer: “All I want is that your love pulls me back”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On “Let Be Him” I can hear the New Build influence, which is nice. It’s a song about being bummed out about being single: “All this freedom we get / it’s not all it’s cracked up to be” and Hot Chip should probably be commended for their persistence with the idea that working hard for one particular person is the best way to be content. This little snippet from the lyrics doesn’t quite fit with the rest but it is a worthy sentiment: “Work hard / play hard at work / lend me your ideas / but not too fully formed”. Meanwhile, the music features the best use of a pedal steel on a British pop record since The KLF were about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally “Always Been Your Love” is another slow song about true love that they manage to deliver without any cloying sentiment, just pure contentment. It might be because the guest backing vocal by  Gang Gang Dance’s Lizzi Bougatsos is suitably wry and detached, or it might be the cheesy MOR guitar work. Either way, it’s a mellow way for the album to sign off and fade out into gorgeous strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that “The Warning” remains Hot Chip’s best album to date, which is a little strange given that there have been three more albums down the pipe since. I think there have been plenty of singular stand out moments since then but I do wonder whether they can pull another truly awesome record out of the bag. All the side projects can’t really help can they? We shall have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the video for “Night And Day”, which manages to be even more barmy than the song itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although nothing can beat this video for “I Feel Better” off “One Life Stand”. It is by the same director and is from the lesser known “boy band versus aliens demolition derby” genre of music videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;honourable-mention-fabric-64-mixed-by-guy-gerber&quot;&gt;Honourable Mention: &lt;em&gt;Fabric 64&lt;/em&gt; mixed by Guy Gerber&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabric 64 begins with a steady beat and lots of stray effects shimmering within the mix before a riff reminiscent of both Kate Bush and Royksopp kicks in (“Store-House Consciousness”). Then comes the wonderful caress of “The Golden Sun And Silver Moon”, all moonlit vocal samples that lap softly under the mix before a strident beat kicks in splashing sunshine all over the track and a clearer vocal emerges. “Shady Triangle” continues the trajectory down and takes on deeper, fuller sound. I have no real reference points for how any of it really sounds: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/catalog/product/view/id/401/s/fabric-64/categories/8/%20%E2%80%9C%E2%80%A6and%20I%20will%20too%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;perhaps have a look at the link on the Fabric website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the subtle shifts and variations as the mix progresses make it very good to work to. For the playlist, I have chosen songs that made me look up to the track listing when I have head my head down. If I hadn’t been limited to just two choices I probably would have chosen “Ribbons Turn To Chains” and “A Blade Through My Piano”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also listened to the Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs album “Trouble” on Spotify this month. I thought it was ok but I did not find it as exciting as people were making out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Case For Yellow As Your New Favourite Colour</title>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/a-case-for-yellow-as-your-new-favourite-colour</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is about the films of Wes Anderson. I am no expert, I’ve just watched them all recently (inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;moonrise-kingdom-a-short-review&quot;&gt;seeing “Moonrise Kingdom”&lt;/a&gt;) and spotted a some similarities and differences between the films and I thought it would be fun to write about them. My appearance on Mastermind with “The Films of Wes Anderson” as my specialist subject will have to wait for now. Feel free to add to the discussion in the comments. In case you don’t know what the films are, here they are in order (with links to their IMDB pages):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/&quot;&gt;“Bottle Rocket”&lt;/a&gt; (1996)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128445/&quot;&gt;“Rushmore”&lt;/a&gt; (1998)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/&quot;&gt;“The Royal Tenenbaums”&lt;/a&gt; (2001)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/&quot;&gt;“The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou”&lt;/a&gt; (2004)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0838221/&quot;&gt;“The Darjeeling Limited”&lt;/a&gt; (2007)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432283/&quot;&gt;“Fantastic Mr. Fox”&lt;/a&gt; (2009)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748122/&quot;&gt;“Moonrise Kingdom”&lt;/a&gt; (2012)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only seen “Moonrise Kingdom” once, so you’ll have to forgive me if I overlook something that is in that movie but not the others or if one of my connections is blown away by that film. Hopefully I was paying enough attention to not make that kind of mistake. Obviously there are few spoilers in what follows so brace yourself or look away if you haven’t seen all the films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-episodic-structure&quot;&gt;1. Episodic structure.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the use chapters in films to make them more bookish or stage-like. Also I have a very short attention span for movies and so I really like it when it is easy for me to remember where to resume a DVD. You can’t tell where a film like “Rushmore” or “Moonrise Kingdom” is going the first time that you watch it and so it proves that there is some force in control of the action, even when it seems that nothing much is happening. I think that “Bottle Rocket” and “The Darjeeling Limited” are the only films that don’t flash titles up to the screen (unless you count the DVD of the latter which presents the short film “Hotel Chevalier” first as “part one”) but in both movies the character played by Owen Wilson is obsessed with schedules and deadlines. In “Bottle Rocket”, Dignan’s notebook could almost be the outline for all of Anderson’s off-kilter characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-a-heist-or-a-chase-features-heavily&quot;&gt;2. A heist or a chase features heavily.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “Bottle Rocket” the action builds towards the break-in at the cooler plant, while in “Rushmore” there is the hare-brained plan to build the aquarium and later on the magnificent staging of the play. “The Royal Tenenbaums” centres on Royal’s plot to win back his wife, more of an emotional chase than an actual one. You could argue that the whole of “The Life Aquatic” is both a heist and a chase: a heist because there is basically no need for Steve Zissou any more and a chase for the shark that killed his partner. It’s a movie peppered with other little wheezes such as the raid on the Operation Hennessy research platform, the rescue of the bond company stooge and the relationship between Steve and Ned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Darjeeling Limited” is mostly chases for trains though the journey of the brothers to see their mother has the feeling of a sham, at least the spiritual side of the trip does. “Fantastic Mr Fox” is the great heist story of my childhood and this aspect of the book makes it into the film largely intact. As for “Moonrise Kingdom”, the description of how the two young lovers meet up to elope is one of the best bits in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-the-use-of-the-colour-yellow&quot;&gt;3. The use of the colour yellow.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember laughing at the yellow jumpsuits towards the end of &lt;em&gt;Bottle Rocket&lt;/em&gt; worn by the gang as the heist begins - I’d waited a long time for a scene dominated by the colour yellow and was starting to wonder whether one would appear. With each passing film, the colour yellow dominates the frame more and more - perhaps culminating in “Fantastic Mr. Fox” and its amazing yellow palette of storybook sunshine. In “Rushmore” it is more subtle than in “Bottle Rocket” but there are scenes dominated by the yellow-brown colour of autumn leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why yellow? And why would I even notice something like that? Well, there has been obvious trend in movies toward certain colours dominating a scene. You can almost tell that a movie is going to be bad because the trailer is predominantly in cyan and orange (Proof: All three “Transformers” movies). There has been an excellent analysis of this phenomenon - the so-called “Teal and Orange Colour-grading virus” - &lt;a href=&quot;http://theabyssgazes.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/teal-and-orange-hollywood-please-stop.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and just because it is just a few screenshots, don’t think whole movies aren’t infected with it. Transformers 2 is in this nightmarishly dreary colour profile from start to end. Basically, when the colour profile of a scene is digitally altered to create warmer flesh tones, what happens is the ensuing background becomes bluer - a sort of murky teal colour. Because digital technology makes it easy, whole films are just being rinsed in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presume that it is easy to notice the yellow in the Wes Anderson movies because it is one of the colours that is most subdued in movies that have been processed in this way. I still think that yellow is probably his favourite colour. There are other films that react against this horrid teal and orange, one that springs to mind is “The Fall” which is a riot of colour from start to finish. Perhaps colourful films are thought of as childish and that dark, murky palettes are used to imply grittiness. Personally I think that is possible for a movie to be colourful &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have darker themes, “Enter The Void” would be a prime example here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-broken-noses&quot;&gt;4. Broken noses.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember exactly when it happens in “Moonrise Kingdom” but I can remember thinking “Aha, someone else has got a broken nose!”. From Francis Whitman’s motorcycle injuries in “The Darjeeling Limited” to the bloody nose received by Max Fischer in “Rushmore”, there are very few Anderson movies in which someone does not get  a broken nose. Perhaps we have to accept Mr. Fox’s tail as a substitute in this case. I wonder if this relates to some significant in Wes Anderson’s life or whether it relates to some maximum level of violence that is allowed to be inflicted upon his characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a difference between the physical and emotional injuries suffered by the characters. In many of the films there is an element of catharsis associated with violence: there is Anthony and Dignan’s fight in the desert in “Bottle Rocket”, the Hallowe’en courtyard attack in “Rushmore”, the suicide attempt in “The Royal Tenenbaums” (resulting in much more damage than a broken nose, so there goes the theory about limiting violence), the pirate attack in “The Life Aquatic”, the rather notorious “I love you but I’m going to mace you in the face scene” in “The Darjeeling Limited”, the hilarious fight between Badger and Fox in “Fantastic Mr Fox”, and the fight between Sam and the rest of the boy scouts in “Moonrise Kingdom”. All these scenes seem to turn the narrative and, apart from in “Moonrise Kingdom”, they all pretty much introduce the third act of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-a-patriarch-loses-his-way&quot;&gt;5. A Patriarch loses his way.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wes Anderson films are full of father figures that have lost their direction and drive. A fair proportion of them are played by Bill Murray. You could argue that “Bottle Rocket” is the exception to this, although it is hinted at in the scene where they perform a practice robbery at Anthony’s house and Anthony ends up challenging Dignan about his theft of some small items. He says “Maybe we should have robbed your house? Did you ever think of that?” and Dignan replies “You know there’s nothing to steal from my mom and Craig!”. Mr. Henry is the obvious replacement for the father figure gone awry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “Rushmore”, Max has a great father but he does not connect to the world that Max sees around him. Meanwhile, Mr. Blume &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; failing at being a father to the sons he is contemptuous of. Royal Tenenbaum seems to be the epitome of paternal failure, yet has played a part in raising amazing children, while Steve Zissou knows he is not Ned Plimpton’s father and says “I hate fathers and I never wanted to be one” yet still tries to forge a bond with him. In “The Darjeeling Limited” it appears that Francis is trying to imitate his father in ordering all the food for his brothers on the train and setting the itinerary for their trip though it later transpires that it was his mother that acted this way. All three brothers are clearly trying to work through the vacuum created by their father’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Fox is not a bad father although Ash seethes when his cousin is favoured over him. In the speech scene we see someone who styles himself as a pillar of community and has to rebuild his reputation when he and the other animals are nearly flushed away by Boggis, Bunce and Bean. He is arrogant and hyper-intelligent and has to learn to respect the ideas and talents of others. In many ways, he comes good in the same way as Royal Tenenbaum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-there-is-a-fantastic-soundtrack&quot;&gt;6. There is a fantastic soundtrack.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have discovered and re-discovered a lot of great music through the soundtracks to these movies. As with the films themselves it is the mixture of familiar elements and new directions taken with each new film that make the soundtracks interesting in their own right. If you cue up the soundtracks in order you start with an almost entirely Mark Mothersbough score for “Bottle Rocket” and then that same style percolates through the songs by The Kinks and The Who that permeate the “Rushmore” soundtrack (which was originally going to feature only songs by The Kinks) and so on. There have been changes, Mothersbaugh’s last soundtrack for Anderson was “The Life Aquatic”, but the soundtrack to a Wes Anderson film is as idiosyncratic as the cinematography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all without mention of how the use of music boxes, car radios, portable record players and cassette decks throughout the films drive both plot and character; there is a real sense of music being all-pervasive. In “Moonrise Kingdom”, the use of “Noye’s Flood” takes this to its height with the music and the elements almost appearing together as characters in the final act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-cross-sectional-shots-and-slow-motion&quot;&gt;7. Cross-sectional shots and slow motion.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of “Fantastic Mr. Fox” (which is understandable because it is animated) each film ends with a slow motion shot. I’m more used to seeing introductions made with slow motion and I think in these films, the slow motion serves a similar purpose - it says “the film is ending now so say goodbye to these guys”. Of course, it is overused in “The Darjeeling Limited” where there is a little too much slo-mo dashing after departing trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another technically impressive and visually charming shot that features in a lot of the movies is the cutaway shot, one where the camera moves through the structure of a building or vehicle (in the case of the &lt;em&gt;Belafonte&lt;/em&gt; in “The Life Aquatic” and the train carriages in “The Darjeeling Limited”) and examines each compartment in turn. In most cases this is to establish setting and to introduce characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “Fantastic Mr Fox”, the cutaway shots  are central to the plot, namely the digging of the tunnels that leads to the safety of the animals and the defeat of Boggis, Bunce and Bean. I can’t decide whether I think these scenes were easier or harder to film because the film was animated: on one hand you are building everything because the film is animated but on the other it is model-based animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sets generally are beautiful, quirky and funny in these movies. Probably my ultimate favourite set is the games cupboard that features in “The Royal Tenenbaums”, all those games are a whole childhood in boxes and there is something about utilitarian nature of the swinging naked lightbulb in a cupboard that I can’t quite put my finger on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-bill-murray&quot;&gt;8. Bill Murray.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s in every single Wes Anderson film apart from “Bottle Rocket” (you could argue that the part of Mr Henry was made for Murray too). I first watched “Rushmore” back in the day (this means at the turn of the century in my student house in Oldfield Park) almost solely because it had &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuckyeahbillmurray.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Bill Murray&lt;/a&gt; in it. The great thing is that it is not just “Bill Murray” that is in these movies either - you are not getting a Ghostbuster or a Caddyshack - his performances are really great, especially his madcap washed up Steve Zissou. Even his smaller roles are awesome, see the quiet tortured cuckold Raleigh St. Clair in “The Royal Tenenbaums”, and it seems impossible to imagine that he was touted as a possible Indiana Jones, but in his cameo rushing for the train at the start of “The Darjeeling Limited” he wears &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; hat and he wears it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the films star a great number of big names giving performances that are unusual compared to their most well known work. Like Tarantino, Anderson has managed to coax a great performance out of Bruce Willis. (Bruce Willis is an excellent actor but in some of his performances the mask of acting is incomplete, you can see the real guy blinking at you from underneath.) Willem Defoe gets to preen against type as the rejected right hand man in “The Life Aquatic” and then revert to his bad guy role as the rat in “Fantastic Mr Fox”. Danny Glover goes from “Lethal Weapon” to being a sensitive soul with a fashion sense &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vindy.com/news/2001/dec/29/danny-glover-goes-for-the-right-look/&quot;&gt;modelled (literally) on Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also George Clooney as Mr. Fox. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-an-event-of-great-importance-sets-up-the-third-act&quot;&gt;9. An event of great importance sets up the third act.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richie Tenenbaum’s attempted suicide; the mission to rescue the bond-company stooge in “The Life Aquatic”; the boys falling in the river in “The Darjeeling Limited”; the lightning strike at the scout camp in “Moonrise Kingdom”. I guess I have already covered this above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-the-action-takes-place-in-a-weird-offshoot-of-the-real-world-and-i-want-to-live-there&quot;&gt;10. The action takes place in a weird offshoot of the real world and I want to live there.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the most obvious examples are the fictional locales of New Penzance in “Moonrise Kingdom” and the fictional New York locations and the outlandish achievements of the precocious Tenenbaum children in “The Royal Tenenbaums”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Helen Fisher, Some Lessons In Love</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/some-lessons-in-love"/>
   <updated>2012-06-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/some-lessons-in-love</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As indicated by my &lt;a href=&quot;articles/reading-list-mid-april-2012&quot;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; posted a couple of months ago (which has since been added to &lt;a href=&quot;articles/another-reading-list&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I’ve started to try to read more about the things that I felt that I did not understand so well. Most notably perhaps is this book “on love” by Helen Fisher. Lest there is any innuendo it is not a book about technique nor does it attempt to explain love to those who have never known it, instead it assumes that we have all been there. In fact, the book attempts to explain the neurological mechanisms of love (specifically romantic love) and describes how science has helped reveal these mechanisms to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long been intrigued by such matters. As an undergraduate I lived as the sole atheist in a bunch of people who were very active in the Christian Union. In our debates, pity was often expressed toward my wholesale belief in science (with, funnily enough, very acknowledgment of my &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; in science) precisely because of how they saw it to be demeaning of emotional concepts like love. The story goes that if you are in love with someone and God didn’t make you, and that if instead the person who loves you only ‘loves’ you because of the chemicals that are flooding their brain, that feeling is somehow false and invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book does a pretty good job of shooting a hole right through that nonsense. I can hear some from the back who might say that I should not have let such spurious talk bother me but I did often approach the same question from a philosophical point of view: if our brains are just (peculiar) meat then why on earth do we feel sensations like love that are so outside of our common-place experience? You have been there, you know that amazing sense of security and sense of purpose that comes from love (and again, specifically romantic love). Well the answer is obvious: to trick us into the rather risky but biologically essential practice of farting out babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great chapter of this book that concerns experiments under &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMRI&quot;&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; that show which brain regions are involved when we think about the people we love, both those we have won and those we have lost. I appreciate that the brain is the organ that science knows least about but the evidence presented is very persuasive to the lay reader. This evidence is supported by a questionnaire conducted across different cultures and age groups that points to a pretty consistent human experience of romantic love, this goes some way to showing that while some social conventions can have a superficial impact on the personal experience of romantic love, there are a number of commonalities that we all share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering those nagging doubts about whether emotions are real or just a ghost in a machine was not my only motivation for reading this book. I think I was also searching for validation of my own experiences and specifically why there is one particular person that I cannot seem to get out of my head. I did not find those specific answers and of course I was naïve to think that I could. Nevertheless, this is an interesting and humane book that discusses many aspects of love (both the good and the bad) in a calm and supportive way. I think if we were all to be more aware of the issues raised in this book it may help us to be more compassionate to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I have read “The Happiness Hypothesis” by Jonathan Haidt, a book that seeks to explain how ancient wisdom and modern psychology can come together and help us to be more happy. As a spoiler I shall say that this is an excellent book and I shall be writing a post about it in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/June-2012-Bookstack.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More books to add to the “University of life” course list&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More books to add to the “University of life” course list. From top to bottom: I picked up “Generation X” for 50p in a charity shop in Tintagel. “Everything Is Going To Be OK” is a picture book full of inspirational mottos. “The Happiness Hypothesis” is the most useful and interesting book that I have read in a long while. I decided to read “How To Write A Sentence” as an alternative to Strunk and White’s “The Elements Of Style” which, while useful, can be a little stuffy! “The Marriage Plot” is a novel with interesting reviews, it was also (ahem) well-priced. After love I decided to go after music as something else I wanted to read about, hence “The Music Instinct” which comes highly recommended. “The Gifts Of Imperfection” is a manifesto for embracing life in a wholehearted way. And “Gonzo”? Well, &lt;a href=&quot;/gonzo-a-graphic-biography-of-hunter-s-thompson/&quot;&gt;I have written about that one already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>CAN, The Lost Tapes</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/can-the-lost-tapes"/>
   <updated>2012-06-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/can-the-lost-tapes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This arrived on Monday and I thought I would give it a post of its own because at over 3 hours of music, I am unlikely to do more than dip into it before writing the album digest next week. It is a far bigger and more enjoyable artefact than I thought it was going to be, so it probably deserves special attention for that reason too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)&quot;&gt;CAN&lt;/a&gt; are German (“&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock&quot;&gt;Krautrock&lt;/a&gt;”) band that I got into about four years ago after my interest in the genre was initially sparked by the “Neu! 75” album and by the Kraftwerk box set. I have four of their albums and I have thought about which one I should include as an &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;understated classic&lt;/a&gt;. It will probably be “Soon Over Babaluma” because no one really writes about that one. Then again, Portishead’s “Third” probably wouldn’t sound as awesome as it does without the influence of “Ege Bamyasi”, so that might be worth considering too. Everyone writes about “Tago Mago” and “Future Days” but for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Lost Tapes” were more forgotten than lost, they had been left in a cupboard in their studio until its contents were catalogued and moved to the German Rock’n’Pop museum in Gronau. As a result some of the stuff here has a less essential feel and there is less cohesion than on the albums but there is still some lovely stuff. The middle of the second disc is particularly excellent: a live version of “Spoon” and a collage of music for the TV crime movie “Tote Taube in der Beethovenstrasse” entitled “Dead Pigeon Suite” that together run for about twenty-seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other favourites after the first few listens are “Graublau”, “Bubble Rap”, “A Swan Is Born” and “Networks Of Foam”. There are other tracks that I can see myself not listening to that often: these include “Are You Waiting For The Streetcar?” (Key lyrics: “Are you waiting for the streetcar? / Are you waiting for the streetcar? / ARE YOU WAITING FOR THE STREETCAR?!??!?” – for ten (!) minutes) and “Blind Mirror Surf”, which is a patience-testing curl of feedback over more feedback. Some of it is quite challenging but even after just a few listens I am getting more out of it. Of course it’s all stuff that didn’t make it on to the (admittedly excellent) albums but even six out of ten material is worth hearing from a ten out of ten band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some words on the box itself. When pre-ordering on Amazon I’ve come to learn that “box set” is often a euphemism for “look we’re giving you extra tracks so don’t push it by asking for decent packaging!”, viz the rather disappointing Orb reissues that came in jewel cases. “The Lost Tapes” though is rather lovely, coming in a sturdy box about the size of a tape can and containing a high quality book that features liner notes in both German and English. There are some interesting photos, artwork and a discography too. Snapping the thing in Instagram is tongue-in-cheek on my part because the aesthetic of the set is one of yellowing tapes and retro recording equipment. It is as much a document about pre-digital recording as it is about CAN’s music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a fun fact that links to elsewhere on the blog. The selection and restoration were done by Jono Podmore, who did some engineering work on The Shamen’s &lt;a href=&quot;uc6&quot;&gt;“Arbor Bona, Arbor Mala”&lt;/a&gt; album!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another book from the “university of life” pile (though &lt;a href=&quot;reading-list-mid-april-2012&quot;&gt;not in the picture&lt;/a&gt;), “Gonzo” is the biography of Hunter S. Thompson in graphical form. In case you don’t know his work, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson&quot;&gt;Hunter S. Thompson&lt;/a&gt; was a journalist who invented the so-called “gonzo” style. This was basically to rock up at some major event and become embedded within it, usually writing up a long form piece from an outsider perspective. He was particularly famous for his work on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Angels:_The_Strange_and_Terrible_Saga_of_the_Outlaw_Motorcycle_Gangs&quot;&gt;Hell’s Angels&lt;/a&gt; and Richard Nixon’s campaign for presidential re-election in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to Hunter S. Thompson through his novel “Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas” when a history teacher at school introduced me to his raggedy copy of the book, complete with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ralphsteadman.com/01gonzo.asp&quot;&gt;Ralph Steadman&lt;/a&gt; cartoons that are as much part of the work as the text. Subtitled “A Savage Journey To The Heart Of The American Dream”, it really pulls no punches at all. I wrote about it for my English Literature coursework, comparing it to “On The Road” but when I read “Fear And Loathing” again about ten years later, I realised that the sixteen year old me had not got it and had no hope of doing so either. I think a lot of people misunderstand “Fear and Loathing”, so I don’t feel so bad about it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter’s work has also featured in films. “Fear And Loathing” was made into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669/&quot;&gt;a film&lt;/a&gt; starring Johnny Depp and directed by Terry Gilliam – I need to watch it again but I don’t think it was anywhere near as good as the book. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376136/&quot;&gt;“The Rum Diary”&lt;/a&gt;, an account of his time in Puerto Rico, was made more recently and once again features Johnny Depp as Hunter&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. More importantly &lt;a href=&quot;http://narami.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;, who kindly comments here from time to time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://narami.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/its-finally-here-the-trailer-of-rum-diary-or-that-movie-i-was-in/&quot;&gt;appeared in the movie as an extra&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book itself is very enjoyable and a very brisk read. The drawing is excellent and really captures the intensity and fervour of Hunter’s writing, though it is strange that so little of Ralph Steadman’s style comes across – especially when his work is such an integral part of Hunter’s. I can understand why though, it does also help to separate the writing from the cartoons that perhaps built to much of a mythology around it, “Fear and Loathing” in particular. As for the structure of the story of Hunter’s life and how that is presented, it is really straightforward and pacy, yet it somehow manages to capture that great voice that rings through his writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story collects together all the elements and events that made him so driven and so crazy, and it shows how, despite the other support mechanisms he had (a wife, a child, editor’s willing to fund his writing), the principal support mechanism he had for dealing with the injustice he saw around him was to drink. As the story progresses we see that when a support mechanism is also one that corrodes, the support that it gives will eventually fall away, as indeed it did for Hunter toward the end of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like graphic novels or the work of Hunter S. Thompson, I can really recommend this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In “Fear And Loathing”, Depp plays Raoul Drake, the fictional proxy of Hunter in the novel. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Moonrise Kingdom: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/moonrise-kingdom-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2012-06-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/moonrise-kingdom-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight I avoided the first half of the football along with my friend Albert Jan and we went to watch “Moonrise Kingdom” at the wonderful Everyman cinema in Hampstead. It was a real treat in every sense. To start with, the Everyman is a lovely cinema. It is quite expensive but you do get what you pay for: a comfortable seat in a great theatre and the chance to watch more than just the latest blockbusters (though it shows those too). I think it was the only cinema in my area that was showing &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, though it has been out for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now to actually discuss the film itself! It is also a delight and definitely the most fun I have had watching a film in the cinema for a very long time. It has loads of recognisable elements from other Wes Anderson films, to the point where relaying all the familiar tropes would probably be a spoiler in itself. The plot is about two children who elope together on a fictional island off the American coast in the 1960s. That’s pretty much it. Much like &lt;em&gt;The Life Aquatic&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Mr Fox&lt;/em&gt;, it’s basically a caper movie. A highly entertaining caper movie at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cinematography is amazing. I think that apart from the fact that they always star Bill Murray, my favourite element of Wes Anderson movies is how he manages to invent and document these amazing fictional places that exist in some weird universe just next door to ours. He manages to unfurl their rituals, their customs and their cartographies right there on the screen in front of you. Meanwhile the performances of the child actors, of Bruce Willis, of Ed Norton and of Tilda Swinton are incredibly entertaining – I thought Norton’s scout master was a little over the top at first but it settles nicely as the film progresses. Bruce Willis gives an excellent understated performances as the island’s police officer. I felt that some of the characters had back story that could have been dug deeper into, but this might have made the film longer and baggier, and one of its joys is the positively snappy 90-ish minute run time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack features Britten’s “The Young Person’s Guide To The Orchestra” prominently and as usual the songs and background music selected are fantastic. I suspect that I shall be hunting it down on Spotify at the very least. One spoiler that you may welcome is that it is worth staying on as the credits roll because there is a great moment with the soundtrack that is a cute fusion of the spirit of Britten’s “…Guide…” and “Tubular Bells”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #18: Fabric 12 mixed by The Amalgamation Of Soundz</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-18"/>
   <updated>2012-06-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-18</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Say what? We’re allowing compilations now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Why not? A good mix is as much an artistic statement as a full-blown single artist album. It takes a lot of skill to get from A to B and keep everything on the boil in between. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/catalog/product/view/id/30/s/fabric-12/categories/8/&quot;&gt;This Fabric mix by The Amalgamation Of Soundz&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favourites because it is a downtempo (but, crucially, not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; downtempo) compilation delivered with flair and using what I consider to be unconventional sources (soundtracks, tribute albums, hip-hop) to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fabric mixes tend to be awash with intelligent house music but at the outset this one barely sounds like dance music at all. The mix begins with a track called &lt;em&gt;Helicopter&lt;/em&gt; by Cliff Martinez, a soundtrack composer whose work on &lt;em&gt;Contagion&lt;/em&gt; has been discussed here before. &lt;em&gt;Helicopter&lt;/em&gt; is from taken from the soundtrack to the movie &lt;em&gt;Traffic&lt;/em&gt; and gently drifts along on an insistent pulse before melting in to a track called &lt;em&gt;Hank’s Transition&lt;/em&gt;, which is by Asche &amp;amp; Spencer and is also a piece taken from a movie soundtrack, this time the film &lt;em&gt;Monster’s Ball&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that is &lt;em&gt;Heart Noir&lt;/em&gt;, a rubbery funky piece by the Nick Ingman Orchestra, followed by an instrumental version of Björk’s &lt;em&gt;Come To Me&lt;/em&gt; performed by a string quartet. If you thought (like I did) that nothing good could ever come out of albums like “A String Quartet Tribute To…” then you are wrong. I’ve already written about &lt;a href=&quot;uc15&quot;&gt;how &lt;em&gt;Come To Me&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favourite Björk songs&lt;/a&gt; and here the arrangement has to convey the wonderful swooning emotion present in the original by transposing everything to strings. By and large they succeed and so the restrictive format actually allows the listener to hear something new in the song. Of course, this is a mix and so attention needs to be paid to how the mix builds from this track. The answer is that as they mix in &lt;em&gt;Htrs&lt;/em&gt; by Geche they manage to take the chilled atmosphere and start to raise the tempo slightly. Despite being labelled as an instrumental it is the first track in the compilation with vocals (albeit heavily processed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, despite the insistent pulse of &lt;em&gt;Htrs&lt;/em&gt;, things are still rather downtempo and this continues into &lt;em&gt;Brown Sugar&lt;/em&gt; by Akasha and &lt;em&gt;Pump Da Ball&lt;/em&gt; by Sofalofa. The former has something of an Alpha vibe to it though it’s probably the jazzy flutes and the spoken word vocals pushed down low into the mix that make me think this, while the latter has a nice trip-hoppy vibe to it. The same can be said for the Amalgamation Of Soundz remix of &lt;em&gt;Meaning&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Davis, which ups the tempo a bit further. I really liked Richard Davis’s contributions to the Bomb The Bass album &lt;em&gt;Back To Light&lt;/em&gt; and he has done some good tracks with Trentmøller too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next track in the mix is an undisputed classic: &lt;em&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/em&gt; by Future Sound Of London (another band you can expect to read about in this series soon). Unfortunately it is one of the more recently released “Translations” of the track (number 3 if you must know) so it is not very recognisable as &lt;em&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/em&gt; - features like the famous vocal line are entirely absent - and the whole track plays out like a set up for the next one, Håkan Lidbo’s &lt;em&gt;Cuba Libre&lt;/em&gt;. Fortunately this begins to take things back up a notch with &lt;em&gt;Cuba Libre&lt;/em&gt; playing out like the soundtrack to a demented drugged-up conga line before the mix slips into RJD2’s &lt;em&gt;Chicken Bone Circuit&lt;/em&gt; for a bit of funky drumming and the feeling that the pace will pick up from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next track is the first of two of amalgamation Of Soundz’s own tracks and the first to really head for the dance floor. Built on a chunky a bass line, an 80’s sax, a rapped loop, and a clipped vocal sample from what sounds like &lt;em&gt;So Hard&lt;/em&gt; by the Pet Shop Boys, it certainly stands out as being something you can actually dance to. Next up is &lt;em&gt;Save Your Soul&lt;/em&gt; by Angelo D’Onorio, a faster track again but still in keeping with the chilled out party vibe it stays with the latin beach feel of &lt;em&gt;Heart Noir&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cuba Libre&lt;/em&gt;, while some nice synth filters later in the track present the possibility of going somewhere else later in the mix. About three minutes in we get to hear what that might be as the track bursts into a wonderful piece of techno house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sets things up nicely for &lt;em&gt;Are You Sure About That?&lt;/em&gt; by The Hi-Lo’s, which is probably the most muscular track here, and then &lt;em&gt;Systemizing&lt;/em&gt; by Jeff Bennet, which is a very satisfactory bit of throbbing groove - it’s very much the peak of the mix here. After that there is the appropriately named &lt;em&gt;Groove Control&lt;/em&gt; by Soultek, a track that starts to take down the tempo again while dredging along a deep, pretty, bass line. After that comes the second Amalgamation Of Soundz track &lt;em&gt;Summer Night&lt;/em&gt; which alternates between burbling away in a cute downtempo techno house style and a beautiful vocal sample that evokes the sun going down. Things round out with Still Phil’s &lt;em&gt;Bey Un Bey&lt;/em&gt; that gently brings everyone back to earth, it’s a fabulous mix of a mournful cello, clicky house rhythms and the same latin vibe that has coursed through the whole mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken as a whole, I love this mix in particular because it shows that not every mix has to go like the clappers, nor does it  have to be entirely amorphous and beatless. It is possible to go from one place to another and back again. I’ve found plenty of mixes since that also do this but this was probably the first mix that I really loved in its entirety and it is certainly one of the only compiled mixes that I consistently go back to, though three others would be the &lt;em&gt;DJ Kicks&lt;/em&gt; entries by Fourtet, Daddy G and Erlend Øye.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, May 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-may-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-05-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-may-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Four albums for Album Digest May 2012:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jack White &lt;em&gt;Blunderbuss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One Little Plane &lt;em&gt;Into The Trees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beach House &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oxia &lt;em&gt;Tides Of Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-april-2012&quot;&gt;April album digest&lt;/a&gt; was rather short on songs, so this month I decided to look for albums that were more based around songs not tracks. Electronic music is relatively easy to write about: the music is often simple (but not always), there are recognisable structures and genres (but not always), and there are conventions that are adhered to (but not always). The repetition of those parenthetical “not always” means that while the writing is easy, it is also often quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining songs and nailing down their qualities is a trickier task, or at least in my experience it is. Often you aren’t adding much more than the lyrics and, of course, electronic music often comes with lyrics too. Nevertheless songs are important, part of whatever campfire and/or churchy tradition that your culture may have. Everyone sings and though it may seem a trivial action, it is part of a deeper, innate neurological function within us. Anyway, I am getting the run on myself it would seem, so let’s meet those albums instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jack-white-blunderbuss&quot;&gt;Jack White &lt;em&gt;Blunderbuss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Elephant, I didn’t have much time for The White Stripes. I think they often stripped things down too far and I prefer more ornate music - especially when the lyrics are weird, which was often the case with The White Stripes. I remember being particularly miffed when one album began with some brilliant tracks (I think it was the one after elephant) and then drifted into bog standard rhythm and blues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solo album by Jack White begins with a sound that won’t alienate White Stripes fans while at the same time the arrangements are much more full-bodied and interesting throughout. &lt;em&gt;Blunderbuss&lt;/em&gt; is a bitter breakup album and for the most part I was able to get into the mood of it even if some parts did seem to be slightly self-pitying. The opening one two punch of &lt;em&gt;Missing Pieces&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sixteen Saltines&lt;/em&gt; is awesome, a real statement of intent. The latter has the dubious distinction of having a thirty-second sample being included with the demo of Microsoft’s awful Windows 8 - the only good thing to come out of that wasted three hours of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought at first that &lt;em&gt;Freedom At 21&lt;/em&gt; was rather self-pitying but it has an irrepressible charm about it too, the tetchy fast paced lyrics rattling away over a rickety riff-heavy bluesy backing. Following that &lt;em&gt;Love Interruption&lt;/em&gt; is rather melodramatic too but once again the intensity of the delivery wins the day, it’s an entertaining song about swearing off being distracted by love. Despite Spotify being a great music discovery service it can’t tell me who is on backing vocals; this is a shame because finding out would constitute a musical discovery. I will google it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title track is an entertaining piano led piece about a disintegrating relationship. The lyricless refrain of “da da da da” is weirdly sad. Meanwhile I can really relate to the line “doing what two people need is never on the menu” - it reminds me of relationships that I have been in that have failed because the two of us have thought more about how things were seen from the outside over what we could be for one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hypocritical Kiss&lt;/em&gt; there’s mention of “a big gang of people who always believe you” (more self-pity?) and also “the men who fight the world and try to love the girl” on &lt;em&gt;Weep Themselves To Sleep&lt;/em&gt;. The latter also features one of the best “scherunk” type guitar noises on a record since Radiohead’s “Creep” - sometimes the joy is in the details!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m Shaking&lt;/em&gt; could have fallen off the back off a truck full of White Stripes B-sides and that’s probably all we need to say about it. &lt;em&gt;Trash Tongue Talker&lt;/em&gt; is better, channeling John Lennon in the most flattering way possible: with decent lyrics and a great hollering vocal, two things that never seemed to appear together often enough on Lennon’s records. It’s a shame then that when trying to build a tribute to McCartney he decides to go for a ropey pastiche of &lt;em&gt;Rocky Racoon&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;I Guess I Should Go To Sleep&lt;/em&gt;. In between the pair of Beatles tributes is the album’s best track &lt;em&gt;Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy&lt;/em&gt;, a song that works so well because it sounds so spontaneous that it could be picked up and played on the hoof. It sounds like it took as long to write as it did to record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On and On and On&lt;/em&gt; is also a pleasant surprise with a nice neat Krautrock-y intro and a much more reflective lyric (more philosophy than self-pity). Best lyric:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stars in the sky never worry.&lt;br /&gt;
They don’t have to hurry, they move in their own way&lt;br /&gt;
But I have to choose what to do&lt;br /&gt;
How to act, what to think, how to talk, what to say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is also a self-pitying lyric but I think it is also self-aware and life-affirming; the scariest thing after a break up is that you no longer have that identity that is conferred upon you by being in a relationship while at the same time one of the best things about being newly single is the chance to redefine the way you think about life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Blunderbuss&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting listen and tells the story of how to get over a breakup over the course of its songs. There are six or seven really great songs here but I do wonder whether I will still be listening to it by next month. Meanwhile, here’s the really cool video for &lt;em&gt;Sixteen Saltines&lt;/em&gt; (Warning, this video is not for everyone!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-little-plane-into-the-trees&quot;&gt;One Little Plane &lt;em&gt;Into The Trees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Little_Plane&quot;&gt;One Little Plane&lt;/a&gt; is the stage name of Kathryn Bint, a folk singer from Chicago. This is her second album and a review of it interested me because it mentioned that some (all?) of the tracks are produced by Kieran Hebden AKA Four Tet and a couple feature Colin Greenwood from Radiohead. (Sorry I’m so sketchy on the details, Spotify doesn’t give you all the liner notes… At least not yet…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is a nice little album and her voice reminds me of Mirah, whose album &lt;em&gt;C’mon Miracle&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favourites and is definitely going to be written up as an understated classic at some point. The opening track &lt;em&gt;She Was Out In The Water&lt;/em&gt; sets the tone nicely, a pastoral song with a spooky undercurrent and a simple arrangement composed of mostly guitar and voice. It has a nice Kate Rusby vibe to it especially in the way she tries to cram slightly more words into each line than the music will allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing Has Changed&lt;/em&gt; is a devastating breakup song (to sit well as a counterpoint to the ones by Jack White. &lt;em&gt;Paper Planes&lt;/em&gt; has more of a band arrangement but I prefer the simpler ones like that on &lt;em&gt;It’s Alright&lt;/em&gt;. The songs here work well as sunny evening music (as was the case with the  &lt;em&gt;C’mon Miracle&lt;/em&gt;, an album I played loads one hot summer in Bath).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the rest of the album follows this template. Standouts include &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, which - quite apart from serendipitous collision with the title of the Beach House album - deviates a little to replace the guitars with a delicate synth filigree. Similarly, the closing track &lt;em&gt;Synthesizer&lt;/em&gt; also features a more synthetic but no less delicate arrangement - in fact it has quite a churchy feel and probably the strongest vocal performance on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one criticism I have of &lt;em&gt;Into The Trees&lt;/em&gt; it is that, apart from &lt;em&gt;Nothing Has Changed&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Synthesizer&lt;/em&gt;, the lyrics didn’t really grab me. It is a very pleasant album but I don’t think I will go back to it again except for those two tracks. Here’s a sweet little video for &lt;em&gt;She Was Out In The Water&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beach-house-bloom&quot;&gt;Beach House &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing about a fixed number of albums each month is a bit of a chore, especially when &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mattischrome/status/207596998923255808&quot;&gt;your iPad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mattischrome/status/207597858478759936&quot;&gt;eats the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mattischrome/status/207599854510284800&quot;&gt;first draft&lt;/a&gt;. However it does get me listening to new things. I had heard of Beach House but not heard them, in particular good reviews of their last album &lt;em&gt;Teen Dream&lt;/em&gt;. As a result when I was struggling to find music for this month their new album &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt; was an ideal candidate. I don’t think &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is like anything else I have except maybe the Washed Out album that I bought last year. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_House&quot;&gt;Their Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; lists some sound-a-likes and inspirations but in the main I have also “heard of but not heard” these bands. Dream Pop, as the genre is rather wistfully known, is a new one on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it. In the main, each of Beach House’s songs are a cavernous swirl of guitar and keyboard over which Victoria Legrand’s voice dominates. The lyrics are not often clear and there’s the odd duffer in there (Error number 2, where the rhyming dictionary is clung to a little too tightly) but this gives the songs an enigmatic quality reminiscent of New Order in their pomp. It all goes by in a bit of a whirl so I am only going to pick out a few tracks, but it is worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The singles &lt;em&gt;Myth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lazuli&lt;/em&gt; are clear and cool, the former opening the album in grand style and the latter shifting things up a notch with a bit of pop jangle for the middle section. My favourite is probably the gentle, chiming &lt;em&gt;Other People&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;Trouble Maker&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wishes&lt;/em&gt; are pretty fantastic songs too (both are kind of about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma&quot;&gt;karma&lt;/a&gt;). Annoyingly there is a bonus track (called &lt;em&gt;Wherever You Go&lt;/em&gt;) stuck on to the end of &lt;em&gt;Irene&lt;/em&gt;, turning it into something unnecessarily 16 minutes long (about 8 are silence). Both songs are fine, though it is easy to hear that &lt;em&gt;Wherever You Go&lt;/em&gt; is too slight to have been on the album proper. I’ve only bothered to listen to it two or three times, which is probably precisely the point of hiding it away. If you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/music/Beach+House/_/Irene&quot;&gt;the song’s last.fm page&lt;/a&gt;, the debate there about this track and about bonus tracks in general is quite amusing (i.e. vitriolic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oxia-tides-of-mind&quot;&gt;Oxia &lt;em&gt;Tides Of Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be an album digest without a bit of electronic music would it? I know nothing about Oxia and only one of the three guest vocalists - Miss Kittin - was known to me via her work with Felix Da Housecat. It’s a tidy little album though, bobbing along nicely on housy beats. The Miss Kittin track &lt;em&gt;Housewife&lt;/em&gt; is indeed a pun on “house”, describing someone who is both a “wife” to a house and to house music. Elsewhere everything is delightfully minimal and functional but with enough flashes around the edges to keep things from being boring viz the easy-listening organ sounds on &lt;em&gt;Rue Brusherie&lt;/em&gt; (which reminds me of Tosca), the clattering reggae-like drum samples on &lt;em&gt;Nightfall&lt;/em&gt;, and the piano rolls on &lt;em&gt;Harmonie&lt;/em&gt; that echo Massive Attack’s &lt;em&gt;Weather Storm&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two vocal tracks show that if Oxia was interested in making a wholly vocal album it would be well be worth a listen. &lt;em&gt;Traveling Fast&lt;/em&gt; (sic) is a pretty and breathy ballad built over some twitchy techno loops and a spooky theremin sound, while &lt;em&gt;The Phoney Lullaby&lt;/em&gt; builds from housey hand claps into a tasteful croon that sounds like a cross between Deep Dish and Pet Shop Boys. The vocalist really reminds me of someone but I can’t put my finger on it, I will update here if I work it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the album has a Royksopp kind of vibe, similar to &lt;em&gt;Melody AM&lt;/em&gt; but lacking the distinctive vocal contributions that album had. Apparently this is Oxia’s second album and it has been ages between the two, if he produces the third in shorter order and entrusts his work to more collaborators I think I will be very interested to hear the results.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, April 2012</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A mostly instrumental month with a comeback from Orbital, an excellent remix collection from Battles, an amazing movie documenting a live performance by the Chemical Brothers and Austin Wintory’s soundtrack to the game &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orbital &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Battles &lt;em&gt;Dross Glop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Chemical Brothers &lt;em&gt;Don’t Think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Austin Wintory &lt;em&gt;Journey (Original Soundtrack)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;orbital-wonky&quot;&gt;Orbital &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite keen on Orbital, though perhaps not as keen as I am on the similarly named Orb. I think I have got all the Orbital albums, mostly bought on eBay after the fact. (Funny story though, I did find a copy of &lt;em&gt;In Sides&lt;/em&gt; in the loft of a house where I lived in Bath, along with several other albums…) My favourite Orbital album is probably &lt;em&gt;Snivilisation&lt;/em&gt; but they all have their moments, whether it is the genuine sliver of emotion shot through &lt;em&gt;Halcyon&lt;/em&gt; off the brown album, the proggy long-form tracks on &lt;em&gt;In Sides&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;em&gt;The Girl With The Sun In Her Head&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Out There Somewhere&lt;/em&gt; (parts one and two), or indeed the arsing about with heavy metal samples on tracks like &lt;em&gt;Tension&lt;/em&gt; off the highly underrated &lt;em&gt;The Altogether&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If pushed I would have said that their last album, &lt;em&gt;The Blue Album&lt;/em&gt; (named self-referentially with respect to their debut and sophomore eponymous green and brown albums) was probably their weakest, although I say that while only remembering the annoying Christopher Ecclestone sample on &lt;em&gt;You Lot&lt;/em&gt; and I could be doing the rest of the album a massive injustice. I will listen to it again some time and issue the appropriate apology in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whatever the case may be, my lukewarm memory of the blue album is why I approached &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt; with a little trepidation - especially given the long absence between the albums. Bands rarely come back from this long away with something genuinely new to offewar ore often than not it is just with warmed over nostalgia for the good old days. A good case in point is the recent Leftfield &lt;em&gt;Liveism&lt;/em&gt; album that I was going to review this month but it was such a waste of time that I felt cheated for having listened to just three quarters of it on Spotify for free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So colour me pleasantly surprised to discover that &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt; is actually pretty good and at some points is utterly brain meltingly phenomenonal. It starts off with &lt;em&gt;One Big Moment&lt;/em&gt;, a track that neatly dovetails disparate sound bites together in the classic &lt;em&gt;Snivilisation&lt;/em&gt; fashion and instantly sets the tone as being “business as usual”. Then comes &lt;em&gt;Straight Sun&lt;/em&gt; a track that bluffs through the first minute or so, crashes into a big wall of trance (at which point I am thinking, about seven minutes into the album, oh dear what have they done? This is a mess…) and emerges on the other side riding an insanely bouncy synth loop all the way over the horizon (and by this point I am thinking this is the best tune EVARRR!). Just for sheer grin inducing madness &lt;em&gt;Straight Sun&lt;/em&gt; is my favourite instrumental of the year so far. There is a cool video on YouTube too which is embedded at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I am putty in their hands. I very much like the collab with Zola Jesus (&lt;em&gt;New France&lt;/em&gt;) and after &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2011&quot;&gt;her great contribution to M83’s album&lt;/a&gt;, I am very keen on looking up more of her (their?) music. There’s another sweet instrumental called &lt;em&gt;Stringy Acid&lt;/em&gt; that is also deliriously good primetime Orbital but it doesn’t quite match &lt;em&gt;Straight Sun&lt;/em&gt;’s goofiness to my ears. The only mis-step is the title track and even that has its moments so it’s bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt; is a solid album that isn’t so much a comeback as picking up from where they left off. It definitely isn’t a novelty record, I think it is something you can pick up now and again, just like any of the other albums. In fact perhaps the best praise for &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt; is that if you put all your Orbital tracks into one itunes playlist, you will have a hard time telling the new tracks from the old ones… in a good way. I hope they do stick around to make more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;battles-dross-glop&quot;&gt;Battles &lt;em&gt;Dross Glop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually remix albums are nothing to get worked up about, as per previous examples &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-june-2011&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2011&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But with this reconfiguration of Battles’ &lt;em&gt;Gloss Drop&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-june-2011&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; there is much to love: there’s that wonderful Spoonerism of the title, the gleefully anarchic pop art approach to remixing the original artwork and the sly extension of one minute interludes to full on eight minute techno remixes… more of which later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dross Glop&lt;/em&gt; was initially released as a series of twelve inch records over the course of eight weeks so I have been listening to these remixes in clutches of three (just two on &lt;em&gt;Dross Glop 1&lt;/em&gt;) and listening to each of the tracks more closely than when receiving all of them in one go. Interestingly two of the remixes each get two minutes lopped off but the resulting album is not so long that the four minutes could not have been accommodated so some thought must also have been put into the pacing of the CD version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how are the remixes and how do they compare with the originals? The answers are “generally excellent” and “really quite well”. I compiled a Spotify playlist that interwove the original album tracks with the corresponding remixes and it is quite a fun listen. Some of the remixes are radical re-workings and some are much longer than the original but others stay quite close to their parent so it works quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gui Boratto remix of &lt;em&gt;Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; takes the post-rock Bond theme stylings of the original and blends in a little Kratwerk tic, it’s quite a minimal reversion of the original that folds in its elements slowly in layers. It’s not quite as minimal as The Field’s take on &lt;em&gt;Sweetie &amp;amp; Shag&lt;/em&gt;, which scoops out the innards of &lt;em&gt;Gloss Drop&lt;/em&gt;’s most poppy track and replaces it with an insistent techno rhythm that takes quite a few listens to get in to. All the melody and rhythm of the original are replaced with drones and clicks, the vocals with barely audible gasps. It’s very compelling but at first it seems very disorientating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Alchemist’s mix of &lt;em&gt;Futura&lt;/em&gt; stays quite close to the original just adding in some hip hop beats and some vocal samples over the top. The intricate Battles man-machine playing instead becomes (for the most part) an insistent drum machine grind, peeling back boundary between performance and sequencing that makes Battles’ music so interesting. Similarly, the Shabazz Palaces remix of &lt;em&gt;White Electric&lt;/em&gt; mercifully halves the original’s length and with a rap over the top highlights the quality and inventiveness of the original by transforming it into an hip-hop track. I look forward to investigating Shabazz Palaces’ music further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a really good remix will extrapolate its parent track into multiple directions away from the original. The mix will take one element and tease it out in one way, then take another element and explore a different direction for a bit. If your remixer is truly skillful, they will then take all these strands and build something as interesting and compelling as the original. This is what Kode9 achieves with his mix of &lt;em&gt;Africastle&lt;/em&gt;, which is a good thing because the original is probably the best thing on &lt;em&gt;Gloss Drop&lt;/em&gt; — the opening track that dances lightly out into space echoing other glories like &lt;em&gt;Atlas&lt;/em&gt;. Remixed, it becomes a house banger with shifting beats and steel drums, retaining its original charms while inhabiting new places too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to confess that I had to go back and play &lt;em&gt;Gloss Drop&lt;/em&gt; again to remember how the original of &lt;em&gt;Inchworm&lt;/em&gt; sounds, it’s the one that sounds like a demented slowed-down carnival float, all marching toy soldiers and chiming guitar riffs. This makes the fact that the Silent Servant version turns into a glitchy techno track with spooky shimmering dub echoes over the top something of a disappointment. It’s a great track that rattles along pleasantly like a more immediate variant of that difficult remix of &lt;em&gt;Sweetie &amp;amp; Shag&lt;/em&gt; but it pales compared to the original. I feel like &lt;em&gt;Inchworm&lt;/em&gt; should have a much crazier remix than this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is followed by two remixes that extend quite considerably two shorter tracks from the original album, &lt;em&gt;Toddler&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dominican Fade&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Toddler&lt;/em&gt; is this simple little guitar jam that Klanding Ray draw out into a glitchy techno beat and a swarm of synth noises that play over the top on their remix. Pretty much a companion piece to the mix of &lt;em&gt;Inchworm&lt;/em&gt; it stands apart from the original precisely because it takes a short piece and expands it into new territory. The treatment of &lt;em&gt;Dominican Fade&lt;/em&gt; by Qluster is also similar, taking a short face paced jam and pulling it out into a chiming proggy piece that is very charming and though it is double the length of the original, it is quite brief compared to other mixes here — it shimmers away into nothingness after just after three and a half minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dross Glop&lt;/em&gt; then ends with what are probably the most accessible mixes on the album. The remix of &lt;em&gt;Ice Cream&lt;/em&gt; by Gang Gang Dance is phenomenal, achieving success at least partly because they leave Matias Aguyo’s unique vocal well alone for well over a minute, focussing instead on their bizarro-world reinterpretation of the musical themes. In fact, it comes pretty close to replicating the demented carnival float vibe of &lt;em&gt;Inchworm&lt;/em&gt; too. As does the Hudson Mohawke mix of &lt;em&gt;Roll Bayce&lt;/em&gt; which turns the original into a deliriously happy goose-bumping inducing cousin of Penguin Cafe Orchestra’s &lt;em&gt;Music For A Found Harmonium&lt;/em&gt; but with added circular saws — it makes me grin from ear to ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remix of &lt;em&gt;My Machines&lt;/em&gt; plays the same role on &lt;em&gt;Dross Glop&lt;/em&gt; as the original does on &lt;em&gt;Gloss Drop&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a competent song featuring Gary Numan that gives you something coherent on which to hang everything else going on around it. The remix itself is one of those standard DFA-esque numbers that extend the track to twice its original length over a elastic bass line while staying pretty faithful to the original vocal. I guess another reference point would be those Shepp Pettibone remixes of tracks like New Order’s &lt;em&gt;True Faith&lt;/em&gt; that just pad out the track to twelve inch length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally Yamantaka Eye gets to remix his own collaboration &lt;em&gt;Sundome&lt;/em&gt; and it’s not too bad, albeit just like a dub version of the original album version. Everything gets spun out of control whereas the original was interesting because of the tension that grows up when attempting to keep chaotic elements in check. Nevertheless it is a nice way to close out the remixes, with something that doesn’t stray too far from the original but shows how central discipline is to the Battles sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-chemical-brothers-dont-think&quot;&gt;The Chemical Brothers &lt;em&gt;Don’t Think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Think&lt;/em&gt; is a movie built from lots of HD footage shot at Fuji Rock Festival last year. Although there is a free CD with the blu-ray, this is ostensibly a review of the film. As with Orbital, I’ve got all the Chemical Brothers’ albums and the selection here works well as a greatest hits set — one of the highlights of the movie is how well all the material dovetails together to create the whole set. Sure, the tracks played from the first two albums are perhaps more belligerent than those from &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt; onwards. Mind you the version of &lt;em&gt;Out Of Control&lt;/em&gt; here is pretty fierce too. They obviously have so much quality material to play and the kinetic nature of the songs means that they can keep the tracks spinning into one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visuals are mostly drawn from the videos that accompanied their excellent 2010 album &lt;em&gt;Further&lt;/em&gt; (probably their best since &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;) and seem designed to totally freak the audience out. And why not? The brilliance of the visuals are the fact that it is not just some lights and an HD projector beaming images on to the screen behind the band, they also beam stuff on to the ground around the arena and at one amazing point in the middle of &lt;em&gt;Swoon&lt;/em&gt;, a swimmer is projected into the air over the crowd. You should not watch this if you are scared of clowns or bugs (though the bugs are very animated) and if you aren’t scared of clowns, you may well be afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film crew also went into the crowd and so the film is much a document of going to a gig as it is the performance on the stage. The fan reactions are great fun and one woman’s reaction  to a particular moment at the end of &lt;em&gt;Superflash&lt;/em&gt; (no spoilers here) is hilarious and is almost worth watching the movie for on its own. At other points the camera cuts back over a huge swathe of dancing people and you realise just how powerful and uniting a force dance music is for people all over the world. As with any footage of a mass of humanity enjoying themselves, I found it very affecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t much more to say besides the fact that even though the album is more fun as a movie, the accompanying CD does represent a good document of the same gig and works well as a summary of the band’s music (perhaps better than a studio greatest hits given its refreshingly scattershot and patchwork approach to the discography). I think I still prefer the albums (&lt;em&gt;Further&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dig Your Own Hole&lt;/em&gt; especially) but the movie certainly helps to flesh out the tracks and to show the human side of this music and how it gets people moving. Meanwhile, “Don’t think, just let it flow” is my new motto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;austin-wintory-journey-original-soundtrack&quot;&gt;Austin Wintory &lt;em&gt;Journey (Original Soundtrack)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the soundtrack to Journey on something of a whim because it was cheap. Having played the game I knew that the music was excellent and an integral part of the experience though I still needed to it to be cheap to persuade myself to buy “video game music”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something I should tell you about my listening habits, specifically what the most played tracks in my iTunes library actually are. They are from the albums that I listen to whenever I can’t sleep, specifically &lt;em&gt;Woob 2&lt;/em&gt; by Woob (a forthcoming understated classic) and Underworld’s soundtrack to the movie &lt;em&gt;Breaking and Entering&lt;/em&gt; (a movie that I have not yet seen). Austin Wintory’s soundtrack is definitely going to be another album on this list, interesting enough to soothe the mind if the mind has to cling on to something and unobtrusive enough to let you drift away in to sleep if you are lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being an ideal bedtime soundtrack, it is not an uneventful listen. It is, after all, the soundtrack to a game and so there is plenty in the music that connects it to the events in the game. I am not sure whether the music in the game just loops in certain places or is generative, so I am not sure what the soundtrack represents. Perhaps the “confluence” tracks (there are six) are the seeds of generative pieces, I am not sure. The game may be short but I don’t think you can complete it in 58 minutes, and so I think this summary of the music in the game is probably slightly more lyrical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pieces are quite simply constructed, most of the arrangements sound performed rather than just digital. It’s all harps, violins and cellos in the slow mournful sections, elsewhere there are insistent tribal drums and chiming bells. For me it’s inextricably linked to the images of the game but I think someone coming to it without having played Journey would still find it an interesting and captivating album of music. I can testify to its transformative power as I have not just listened to it in bed but also on the way to work in the middle of a rain storm. The soundtrack provided a strange backdrop to the rain lashing down and I was nearly lifted off the ground like the little character from Journey as the wind whipped up under my umbrella (not to mention the fact that I too should have been wearing a scarf).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to mention how beautiful the string arrangements and (Tibetan?) percussion in &lt;em&gt;Atonement&lt;/em&gt; are, the wonderful dramatic ending to &lt;em&gt;Threshold&lt;/em&gt; and the sheer joy of &lt;em&gt;Apotheosis&lt;/em&gt;. If you download only one track though, make it &lt;em&gt;I Was Born For This&lt;/em&gt; the vocal track that plays over the end credits of the game — it’s haunting, mystical, and would work well on any soundtrack. In conclusion, I’d say the soundtrack is worth £3.49 of your money (it certainly was mine) and that if you are having a stressful day it would probably help to soothe your soul almost as effectively as playing the game itself. It’s available from iTunes and from the playstation network. The video shows footage from the recording sessions as well as from the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-digest-april-2012---notes&quot;&gt;Album Digest April 2012 - Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes I went back and listened to it. Turns out I remembered correctly, &lt;em&gt;The Blue Album&lt;/em&gt; is not that great compared to the other Orbital albums. The first and last tracks are excellent but I’d forgotten the true horror of &lt;em&gt;Acid Pants&lt;/em&gt;, a track that is far worse than &lt;em&gt;You Lot&lt;/em&gt; (which itself was as annoying as I remembered it to be). The problem with &lt;em&gt;Acid Pants&lt;/em&gt; is that if you are going to produce a track that is meant to be funny, it’s not a good idea to make it utterly humourless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, here is a short review of &lt;em&gt;Liveism&lt;/em&gt;. Its one redeeming feature is a goosebump rendering performance of &lt;em&gt;Release The Pressure&lt;/em&gt; but it only shows how the rest of the tracks are lifeless facsimiles of the album versions (with crowd noise over the top). Meanwhile at one point there is the following exhortation of the crowd: “Come on Australia!” This made me wonder why on earth they’d decided to record a supposedly definitive concert there. Why not Brixton Academy which is surely the place where Leftfield’s live performances have been laid down in history? Or is the whole rumour true and they really are banned from there for life? Whatever, this album is a complete waste of time. Even an utterly useless third album of subpar new material would be better than this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hefty reading list that should keep me occupied into the summer. A friend on facebook asked “What course is that for?”, to which I replied “It’s for one of the modules I am doing at the university of life.” This response was quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #17: Nearly God by Nearly God (Tricky)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-17"/>
   <updated>2012-04-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-17</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sit back and let it happen, / Let us take your time away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; is Tricky’s second album, which was released under a different name either because Island rejected it as the follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Maxinequaye&lt;/em&gt; or because it came too quickly after and Tricky just wanted it released. I had this album before &lt;em&gt;Maxinequaye&lt;/em&gt; because back then it wasn’t as easy to go back and catch up with albums that you had missed as it is now. I had bought enough singles to get the postcards through the post that advertised &lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; (this, kids, is what we had before e-mail and liking things on Facebook) and when I heard &lt;em&gt;Poems&lt;/em&gt; for the first time on the radio I was incredibly excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album is largely composed of collaborations and it is possible to think of Martina here as another contributor, she certainly doesn’t dominate the sound of the album like she does on &lt;em&gt;Maxinequaye&lt;/em&gt;. There are some pretty big names: Terry Hall, Bjork, Neneh Cherry and Alison Moyet. Even better at no point does the production, stripped way back from the first album to an almost demo-like quality, get dwarfed by or threaten to underserve the contributions of the guest vocalists. One of Bjork’s donations is the vocal from &lt;em&gt;She’s Been Flirting Again&lt;/em&gt; off &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; and it adds to the remix/homespun feel of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first track is a cover of Siouxie and the Banshees’ B-side &lt;em&gt;Tattoo&lt;/em&gt;. I only heard the original while writing this post but it’s obvious that Tricky has slowed it down to about half its original speed but has otherwise remained quite faithful to it. In fact the original reminds me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Risingson&lt;/em&gt; by Massive Attack (&lt;em&gt;Mezzanine&lt;/em&gt;, 1997) and while that song is based on a Velvet Underground sample, Souixie and the Banshees are cited as inspirations for the &lt;em&gt;Mezzanine&lt;/em&gt; sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;em&gt;Poems&lt;/em&gt;, in which Tricky, Terry Hall and Martina Topley-Bird each get a verse to deliver that ends with the line “you promised me poems” — with the resulting song stretching over seven minutes. All this happens in between a dragging beat and some beautiful guitar playing. It all seemed very profound when I was sixteen and now I can’t be sure if it has improved with age or not because it just raises the hackles anyway — I still remember all the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come Together&lt;/em&gt; with Neneh Cherry was also featured on her &lt;em&gt;Man&lt;/em&gt; album and it kind of shows up as having slightly better production values than the other tracks here. It does sound a bit like it has fallen off &lt;em&gt;Maxinequaye&lt;/em&gt;. Tricky recorded quite a few tracks with Neneh Cherry around this time, as many as ten apparently. The only other one that I have heard is &lt;em&gt;Had You In Me&lt;/em&gt; (a B-side to one of the many singles from &lt;em&gt;Man&lt;/em&gt;) which is actually quite similar to &lt;em&gt;Together Now&lt;/em&gt; but with a lyric containing 100% more innuendo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep Your Mouth Shut&lt;/em&gt; is the aforementioned track to which she leant the vocals &lt;em&gt;You’ve Been Flirting Again&lt;/em&gt; (and the improv sections of &lt;em&gt;The Modern Things&lt;/em&gt; as well). This is swirled up with a crushing beat, what is probably Tricky’s harshest and most distorted vocal performance and a sample of Das EFX: “When the homies think I’m stuck up / I tell ‘em shut the fuck up”. I hated this track when I first heard it (and &lt;em&gt;You’ve Been Flirting Again&lt;/em&gt; was not one of my favourite Bjork songs back then either) but I think it has actually improved with age — it’s like a proto-_Money Greedy_.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another pseudonym (&lt;em&gt;Starving Souls&lt;/em&gt;) was used to release &lt;em&gt;I Be The Prophet&lt;/em&gt; as a single and I wish I had bought it as it is quite valuable now. It’s a simple single verse song chanted over a sparse yet driven musical arrangement consisting mainly of a string riff and synth noises. Like &lt;em&gt;Poems&lt;/em&gt; the vocal is in three parts: Tricky then Martina and then both together. I think that this track does more than any other to show how well their voices complemented one another, it is definitely one of the best tracks Tricky ever produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make A Change&lt;/em&gt; is basically Alison Moyet wailing the blues while Tricky constructs a beat in the background that sounds like he’s repeatedly snapping a tree trunk in half. True to the pattern of the entire album, it’s arranged is repetitive and pared right back to ensure that the focus is right there on the fantastic vocal performance. I don’t have enough Alison Moyet records really — I can remember having a greatest hits tape out from the library when I was 15 and playing it to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is another cover version but unlike &lt;em&gt;Tattoo&lt;/em&gt; I am not the least bit curious about the original because the version of &lt;em&gt;Black Coffee&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; is so good. As usual, it rests on the phenomenal vocal talents of Martina but there is also a real dramatic tension given to the proceedings by the clipped piano samples that underpin the verses. For a supposed side project album it is amazing that &lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; is stuffed with songs that are this good — hence its inclusion in the understated classics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can remember freaking out my mum by walking down the stairs one morning rattling Tricky’s vocals on &lt;em&gt;Bubbles&lt;/em&gt;. I think she told me that if I did it in public then people would think that I was going crazy. Given that at that time I wasn’t sure yet if Tricky wasn’t completely crazy anyway, I took this as a compliment on my facsimile of his delivery. &lt;em&gt;Bubbles&lt;/em&gt; is of course a fairly basic Tricky track (with the addition of more Terry Hall) and many iterations of it would feature on B-sides through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Sing For You&lt;/em&gt; features Cath Coffey who sang with the Stereo MCs, a band who were famous at the time for disappearing off the face of the earth — much like The Avalanches today I suppose. The song is okay but you can’t help but think as it drags out over more than six minutes that Martina might have done more with the song. Being a sleepy ballad means it does bring the album back to earth somewhat and things lurch back awake a bit with &lt;em&gt;Yoga&lt;/em&gt;. Bjork is back cooing away indistinctly (except for a bit where she clearly sings “Don’t fuck with me”) and a repetitive guitar loop rattles away in the background. It’s probably the most abstract song here but both Bjork and Tricky have done better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; proves that side projects can be worth tracking down and listening to. One could argue that the next album that Tricky released (&lt;em&gt;Pre Millennium Tension&lt;/em&gt;, even the title is half hearted at best) was probably more deserving of being shelved under a different name. Nevertheless there’s no harm done, it is pretty easy to find a copy and you’ll be getting your hands on a hidden gem if you do.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sam Selvon, The Lonely Londoners</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-lonely-londoners"/>
   <updated>2012-04-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-lonely-londoners</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lonely Londoners&lt;/em&gt; by Sam Selvon was written in 1956 and tells of the experiences of West Indian men moving to London for work. It has been described as the definitive novel about the experiences of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/item.asp?item_id=50&quot;&gt;Windrush settlers&lt;/a&gt;. The narrative centres on a man named Moses who was one of the first to come to London and finds himself the first port of call for many subsequent immigrants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It look to old Moses that he hardly have time to settle in the old Brit’n before all sorts of fellars start coming straight to his room in the Water when they land up in London from the West Indies, saying that so and so tell them that Moses is a good fellar to contact, that he would help them get place to stay and work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is written to imitate the speech and linguistic form of the West Indian subculture and this provides immediate immersion in the story. From an outsider’s standpoint you gradually learn that a “test” is a man, to “rab” is to moan about something and so on. There are no chapters, just sections that describe a new person that Moses knows or meets for the first time. Among these are Sir Galahad, the guy who rocks up to London in just his coat with twenty pounds in his pocket and feels warm in winter but cold in summer; Cap, the feckless Nigerian guy who swindles everyone out of their money; Harris, who dresses in a suit and speaks the Queen’s English, desperately trying to impress white people and fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story then is a series of anecdotes about these West Indian guys in a London past that is bathed in smog and still adjusting to the influx of people from around the world after the war. Moses has a Polish landlord and there are many mentions of how black people are refused housing and work on account of their skin colour. Reading today (even with problems of racism still in the news) the descriptions of race relations seem strange, a completely different world even though it was just sixty years ago. However, this aspect of the story is underplayed as the anecdotes are mostly set entirely within the West Indian community while the social history is played out in the background. The social tensions are an important part of the story but it underpins the action in subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the book there is a wonderful freeform section about London in the summertime, mostly concerning picking up women in the park for sex, in which all the sentences are merged into one long phrase over ten pages in order to capture the giddy rush of summer time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one strong female character in the novel. One guy, Tolroy, has sent for his whole family from Trinidad and his aunt has accompanied his mother, much to Tolroy’s disgust. Tanty is one of those old women who knows everyone from when they were a child and is very scornful of those guys who pretend not to remember who she is. Despite being the object of scorn from some of the guys, she does get a section showing how the West Indians have started setting up shops so they can buy things from home. Unfortunately other female characters in the book are simply mute partners or ciphers for sex partners. Mention is made of the fetishisation of black men by white girls (and the occasional “sissy”) including one that Moses is convinced he is killing and gets quite disturbed by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of the anecdotes are quite funny (I laughed out loud at one in which Cap lures a seagull into his flat in an attempt to kill it and eat it), in general there is a pathos to many of the tales. In some, people act out of character because of the strangeness of their situations and in others because life is not quite what has been promised to them. Towards the end of the book Moses is quite depressed about how little he has to show for his time in London and whether he should just go home. I think this is a feeling that many people experience in London, I was certainly able to empathise with some of Moses’ feelings despite the many different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed &lt;em&gt;The Lonely Londoners&lt;/em&gt;, it is a short quick read and really engaging and immediate — quite a nice change after the surreal inventiveness and weird plots of Murakami in &lt;em&gt;1Q84&lt;/em&gt;. I’m going to do something naughty and type out the last lines of the book because they are bittersweet and sad and pretty, so if you don’t want to know the result look away now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a summer night: laughter fell softly: it was the sort of night that if you wasn’t making love to a woman you feel you was the only person in the world like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of using this post as the basis of a homework essay, make sure you include some of your own ideas about the book too!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I pay to have this blog up and running. That is, I pay for the space where it is stored and I pay for the name. I have to look after all the files and plug-ins, I have to perform all the updates and optimise the database tables. All this is great fun but wouldn’t it be cheaper to slap the mattischro.me address onto a hosted WordPress.com account?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yes it would. I suppose I just like the independence of having my own little patch of cyberspace, sitting there waiting for all you dear readers to come and visit. Nice ideas don’t make the world go round though and so I need a better reason than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a place for my stuff. You will notice that there are no adverts here, no tickers and no pop-ups. I can put my pictures up without worrying that some evil corporation will take ownership of them or subject them to facial recognition software to work out who I hang out with. I can write about the music, films and books that I am passionate about without being paranoid about whether that information will be used by some advertising company to sell the same music, films and books to people deemed to be in the same demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that everything that I write here will probably be read by a current or future employer without being lulled into a false sense of security by a dubiously worded privacy policy. In fact, I can better control some of the feedback that search engines give about me as this site is one of the first results returned by a search on my name. If you get involved and comment here, you probably get an even better deal — it is unlikely that your words will be picked up by anyone putting your name into a search engine. At least not until this humble blog achieves world domination, something that will be a while in coming yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that protection and safety and reassurance, it all comes back to content. This (not-so-) little blog is worth the cost in money for all it pays back in freedom of expression. It is a privilege that I do not use to its full capacity as it is the perfect place to think issues through and deliberate upon them at length — I don’t do that often enough. Nevertheless, the site has become an invaluable aid to me and often provides a focus for my thoughts and actions. I think that is worth the money.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five albums for Album Digest March 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Rooms Filled With Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Shins &lt;em&gt;Port Of Morrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grails &lt;em&gt;Deep Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Build &lt;em&gt;Yesterday Was Lived And Lost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scuba &lt;em&gt;Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice collection of albums this month - things usually pick up in March after a slow period after Christmas. One of these is a “catch-up” (the album by Grails) but apart from that one, everything else was released in the last five weeks or so… I should probably have included the album by Racehorses that I bought on my birthday but I will have to leave that for next month as I haven’t listened to it that much. In fact, it is still in my housemate’s car!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fanfarlo-rooms-filled-with-light&quot;&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Rooms Filled With Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with some friends to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fanfarlo.com&quot;&gt;Fanfarlo&lt;/a&gt; on my birthday and really enjoyed the gig. Songs from both albums were played and you could tell from the movement of the band between instruments between songs that this second album is more complicated and involves a different sound. At the time I enjoyed the tracks from the previous album a bit more. It’s not a surprise really, I had only owned &lt;em&gt;Rooms Filled With Light&lt;/em&gt; for a few days and unusually for me, I hadn’t spent the weeks up to release craving all the new songs. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Reservoir&lt;/em&gt; is probably one of my favourite albums of the last five years and many of the songs are bound up with all kinds of memories and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for really loving the songs off &lt;em&gt;Reservoir&lt;/em&gt; at the gig is that it is a really good set of songs that the band can obviously now play in their sleep. &lt;em&gt;Comets&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Luna&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Finish Line&lt;/em&gt; were dashed out with a new intensity live (especially compared to when I had seen them at the O2, supporting Snow Patrol). Meanwhile the songs on &lt;em&gt;Rooms…&lt;/em&gt; are a bit slower than the ones on &lt;em&gt;Reservoir&lt;/em&gt; and aren’t as immediate. Naturally, the songs that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; immediate like &lt;em&gt;Replicate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/em&gt; were introduced at the start of the gig (and did manage to make &lt;em&gt;I’m  A Pilot&lt;/em&gt; sound a bit plodding by comparison). The album does this too and so on the first few listens it does feel like you are trudging a bit through the slower material, especially in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The material is darker throughout, take for example the opening one-two punch of &lt;em&gt;Replicate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/em&gt;. The first is a sinister tale filled with virii and howls at the moon, it’s a song that makes you feel like the band have moved on somewhere new after &lt;em&gt;Reservoir&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile &lt;em&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/em&gt; feels more like the Fanfarlo of old with lyrics that while echoing tracks like &lt;em&gt;Finish Line&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Howard T. Wilkins&lt;/em&gt; are much direct: “Let’s cut it up and dissect it / Pull it apart ‘til it’s gone”. Perhaps it is a protest against reviewers or maybe the best attempt at a song about post-modernism since &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics-7&quot;&gt;Idlewild’s &lt;em&gt;Roseability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Admittedly the pool of songs about post-modernism is quite small and my sample of it even smaller.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first few times sat listening to the album, it would completely disappear from my ears. It made me realise just how arresting and attention-commanding an album &lt;em&gt;Reservoir&lt;/em&gt; is. This is not to say that the rest of &lt;em&gt;Rooms…&lt;/em&gt; is junk, far from it. Any regular reader will know that chez mattischrome, much is made of albums that pull you down into murky depths and explore emotion in subtle and understated ways. I am not really sure that anything among these songs could quite be up to that standard though even if they have chipped away at me over the weeks since and revealed themselves slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially it was songs like &lt;em&gt;Tightrope&lt;/em&gt; that sputter into a bit of life - it’s the album’s third most upbeat song - that held appeal but after a while I found myself really enjoying the sweet romantic misery of &lt;em&gt;A Flood&lt;/em&gt; (“Open your raincoat, let it fall / A flood will come here anyway”), getting into the weird grooves of &lt;em&gt;Feathers&lt;/em&gt; (something about a river and a siren) and the strangely euphoric quasi-ballad &lt;em&gt;Bones&lt;/em&gt;, a song that I feel a strong affinity for even if it doesn’t quite feel finished (“It’s in the bones / It’s where the blood goes”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it’s a good listen once you have allowed it to grow on you. Is it better than &lt;em&gt;Reservoir&lt;/em&gt;? Not quite. Will they probably make a better album than this next time out? Very likely. But for now &lt;em&gt;Rooms Filled With Light&lt;/em&gt; will do very nicely indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shins-port-of-morrow&quot;&gt;The Shins &lt;em&gt;Port Of Morrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, The Shins were very important to me. This was back when I had just started my PhD and I was relatively flush for disposable income compared to when I was an undergraduate. The FOPP chain of musical stores was still operating and Bath had two stores filled with cheap CDs, meaning that there was a world of exciting music to explore. What’s more, the cheese and red onion chutney toasties were pretty amazing too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shins’ second album &lt;em&gt;Chutes Too Narrow&lt;/em&gt; (swiftly followed by a swoop for their début &lt;em&gt;Oh, Inverted World&lt;/em&gt;) was one of those exciting musical adventures. Even now, nine years on, it is a solid ten songs that takes me right back to that time — in the way that all the best music does. I can think of people who I have met since then (OK, one particular person) that I can’t remember what life was like before they showed up — yet somehow these songs and the memories they evoke are part of that time. It’s quite spooky to listen to a song like &lt;em&gt;Kissing The Lipless&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, songs from &lt;em&gt;Oh, Inverted World&lt;/em&gt; (specifically &lt;em&gt;New Slang&lt;/em&gt;) were featured in the movie &lt;em&gt;Garden State&lt;/em&gt;, which is probably the film that (after meeting the “particular person”) summed up all my romantic angst, so things do get folded back into your life. Of course now we can look back at &lt;em&gt;Garden State&lt;/em&gt; and laugh, it’s really not that good a movie and its then uber-cool soundtrack (which got me into Frou Frou as well, another album I find difficult to listen to now…) is perhaps one of the things that ages it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, The Shins released &lt;em&gt;Wincing The Night Away&lt;/em&gt;, an album that for me is as awkward as its title. Perhaps I had changed as a person or the ‘band’ (it’s just one guy) had changed too much too, making the whole thing too strange to bear. That said, it does feature some great songs like &lt;em&gt;Phantom Limb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Australia&lt;/em&gt;. When they come up in my iTunes’ shuffle, I won’t pass them over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years on from &lt;em&gt;Wincing…&lt;/em&gt;, there is the new album &lt;em&gt;Port Of Morrow&lt;/em&gt; (Album titles are not a strong suit) and as always it is pretty good. There are three absolutely amazing songs — &lt;em&gt;The Rifle’s Spiral&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Simple Song&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;It’s Just Life&lt;/em&gt; — unfortunately, these are the first three songs and so the album falls  flat after that early burst. There are also three rather annoying ones — &lt;em&gt;September&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fall of ’82&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;40 Mark Strasse&lt;/em&gt; — and these are pretty near to the end of the album. This means that you should probably listen to the album backwards to get the most of it and does disservice to the title track, tacked on at the end as it is because it is the “slow meaningful one”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grails-deep-politics&quot;&gt;Grails &lt;em&gt;Deep Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I raved about &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt;, a side project of Grails and so I resolved to discover some of their music. I went back to their most recent album &lt;em&gt;Deep Politics&lt;/em&gt;, which was released last year and is available on Spotify. In retrospect, it seems obvious that a side project would sound like the band’s home material but perhaps I am just used to side projects as being things that are completely different to an artist’s original material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is obviously missing compared to &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt; is the samples, vocal and instrumental, and beats that give that album its hip hop vibe. What Grails represent then (at least on the evidence of &lt;em&gt;Deep Politics&lt;/em&gt;) is competent progressive rock though I have read them described as post-rock, which fits too. These tracks build nicely upon some pretty instrumentation, a lot of it reminding me of Mike Oldfield but probably only because I am familiar with all his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening track &lt;em&gt;Future Primitive&lt;/em&gt; sounds to me like a missing link between Massive Attack’s &lt;em&gt;Protection&lt;/em&gt; (the eastern strings and the propulsive groove) and &lt;em&gt;Mezzanine&lt;/em&gt; albums (those chugging guitars that surface at various points, the somnambulant atmosphere), though the duelling solos by about three-quarters through are pure Oldfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corridors Of Power&lt;/em&gt; appears remixed as &lt;em&gt;Corridors Of Power II&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt;, it is instantly recognisable. In fact, in terms of riffs from this album, &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt; probably uses this one as a template — almost to the point of the latter being a remix album. Certainly &lt;em&gt;Corridors Of Power&lt;/em&gt; makes the connection between post-rock and hip-hop not seem so far-fetched as you might first think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite track though is &lt;em&gt;I Led Three Lives&lt;/em&gt;. Not by coincidence it’s the longest thing here, a simmering epic that showcases the album sui generis and builds to noisy, squally, static at the end. Taken in tandem with the closer &lt;em&gt;Deep Snow&lt;/em&gt;, which begins with beautiful acoustic guitar and is the most pastoral tune on the album, it makes for a beautiful end to the whole thing. I really love how taking a punt on a single album can lead in loads of new directions. I am looking forward to digging up even more stuff by Grails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-build-yesterday-was-lived-and-lost&quot;&gt;New Build &lt;em&gt;Yesterday Was Lived And Lost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another month, another Hot Chip side project (and the new album &lt;em&gt;In Our Heads&lt;/em&gt; is due from the mothership in June!). Whereas the 2 Bears album last month was a celebration of early 90’s house music, &lt;em&gt;Yesterday Was Lived And Lost&lt;/em&gt; is more a celebration of the polished 80’s albums of the likes of Peter Gabriel or Robert Palmer. Like &lt;em&gt;Be Strong&lt;/em&gt; could have been, this could easily be a vacuous genre collage but once again it all comes off without a hitch. Despite having loved &lt;em&gt;Be Strong&lt;/em&gt;, I think that I like this album even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly &lt;em&gt;Behind The Shutter&lt;/em&gt; is my favourite song of the year so far, it sounds a bit like Erasure and it has a lovely sweet lyric about knowing that someone loves you even they say that they don’t — well that’s my take on it. When I listen to it on the way to work it makes me deliriously happy and I have to fight the temptation not to put it on “repeat one”. Except putting the best song on repeat is not necessary because there are plenty of great songs with many others that are capable of making you grin from ear to ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;em&gt;Medication&lt;/em&gt; for instance, a dry humoured song about the joys of… well… medication. It is the &lt;em&gt;Sledgehammer&lt;/em&gt; de nos jours, sort of. Then there’s &lt;em&gt;Do You Not Feel Loved?&lt;/em&gt;, a sweet counterpart to &lt;em&gt;Behind The Shutter&lt;/em&gt; that pads along on a warm house-y beat (that the 2 Bears would have been proud to call their own) and possesses a spine-tingling chorus. Or perhaps I can convince you about &lt;em&gt;Finding Reasons&lt;/em&gt;, a slightly downbeat number that conjures up the ennui of watching looped bad news on 24 hour news channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, &lt;em&gt;Miranda, Be My Guide&lt;/em&gt; is one of those great songs that uses a name and takes complete possession of it. My walk to work keeps cutting off another great track that closes the album called &lt;em&gt;The Silence And The Muttering&lt;/em&gt; — a shame because it is a lovely confection built around a swirling almost-Fairlight synth and a sweet forlorn lyric (“You’re gonna need the strength of feeling / to escape the silence and the muttering). It culminates in a delicate music box coda, though the iTunes version has a tetchy little bonus track called &lt;em&gt;Your Love&lt;/em&gt; tacked on the end too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the joys of Hot Chip albums (aside from the fact that they appear every two years like clockwork) is that they are always so disparate with lots of elements pushing and pulling the songs around in different directions. On albums like &lt;em&gt;The Warning&lt;/em&gt;, it can seem like barely organised chaos (definitely in a good way) and sometimes I have found myself thinking that a particular track is brilliant (e.g. &lt;em&gt;And I Was A Boy From School&lt;/em&gt;), wishing that I could have a whole album that sounded like that. I suppose side projects answer those wishes to some extent and, unexpectedly, they’ve turned out to be excellent records that stand alone well too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scuba-personality&quot;&gt;Scuba &lt;em&gt;Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges of writing amateur music reviews like these is that you can sometimes find yourself really liking some music but without having any context for actually writing about it. It can make you feel rather self-conscious (c.f. every album digest that includes an album that describes itself or is described in the media as “dubstep”) and limit your (already limited in my case) ability to describe the music. I say this because I don’t go clubbing and I don’t seem to have many friends who are specifically into this kind of music (by which I mean electronica). It’s quite funny how listening to electronic music is one of my hobbies and yet unlike most past-times it doesn’t seem to have garnered me a whole group of people with whom I can discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still a trail of breadcrumbs to follow though: blogs; fabric CDs; and music discovery sites. Even if - like Hansel and Gretel’s trip to the gingerbread house - it can sometimes end badly, there is still plenty of good music to discover. Often I will ignore something until multiple sources start pointing me toward it (yeah I’m a sheep baaa!) and this was very much the case with Scuba’s &lt;em&gt;Personality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite lacking the complete vocabulary and clubbing experience to write about dance music, I do know that there is a lovely house piano break on &lt;em&gt;NE1BUTU&lt;/em&gt; and that the riff on &lt;em&gt;The Hope&lt;/em&gt; is a pretty nice bit of wonky acid twiddling à la Josh Wink’s &lt;em&gt;Higher State of Consciousness&lt;/em&gt; (a track so visceral that it get re-released every three years in barely remixed form to despoil whatever the new trend is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the album is very easy to admire but perhaps hard to love - particularly when up against the other more song-centred albums this month - but despite this the best thirty seconds to a minute of music I’ve listened to this month comes from this album. About halfway through &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Dissonance&lt;/em&gt;, the whole track just turns to sludge as all the ideas from everywhere on the album are piled into the mix creating a sort of electronic music black hole. Something like that is always going to be a ‘moment’ on an album, albums that layer all their elements over one another for a whole album are often very incoherent or tiresome (&lt;em&gt;Glass Swords&lt;/em&gt; by Rustie anyone? What a pile of poop that was!) but it is really nice to have them in the middle of what is a solid and warm album full of generous beats.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #16: Ambient 2 / The Plateaux Of Mirror by Howard Budd and Brian Eno</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-16"/>
   <updated>2012-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-16</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;among-fields-of-crystal--wind-in-lonely-fences&quot;&gt;Among Fields of Crystal / Wind in Lonely Fences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written about a &lt;a href=&quot;uc4&quot;&gt;fair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;uc6&quot;&gt;number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;uc13&quot;&gt;ambient&lt;/a&gt; albums in this series (and there are at least two more to come!) but perhaps none are as unobtrusive as this one by Howard Budd and Brian Eno. It’s a subtle collection of music that sits at the margins of your consciousness: for a long time it was the music that I turned to when I could not sleep but I could just as easily imagine it as (ahem!) romantic background music as I could something to work to. I actually bought it in 2006 to listen to on an overnight flight back from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pieces are composites of Budd’s piano motifs and the electronics and drones that Eno drapes around them. These days that might lead in all sorts of directions but back in 1980 with the technology not so advanced, the intervention of the synthesizers has to be more subtle. The opening track &lt;em&gt;First Light&lt;/em&gt; is almost all piano until a small synth motif comes in at about a minute before the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album does not really deviate from this template. Sometimes it is necessary for an album just to be a series of meditations where you can find your own thoughts and feelings. The music here is delicate and fragile, sometimes vanishing into moments of silence. It could almost be a soundtrack to J.G. Ballard’s &lt;a href=&quot;the-crystal-world&quot;&gt;Crystal World&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plateaux_of_Mirror&quot;&gt;short article&lt;/a&gt; about the album from wikipedia explains a bit more about how the album came into being and a bit more about the roles of each musician in creating the finished record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is not a great deal to discuss about &lt;em&gt;The Plateaux Of Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, here are some pen pictures (or pen &lt;em&gt;echoes&lt;/em&gt;) of the other three entries in the &lt;em&gt;Ambient&lt;/em&gt; series. I’ll briefly mention that I considered &lt;em&gt;Small Craft On A Milk Sea&lt;/em&gt; to be &lt;a href=&quot;2010-in-review&quot;&gt;one of my favourite albums in 2010&lt;/a&gt; and I discussed &lt;em&gt;Drums Between The Bells&lt;/em&gt; back in &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-july-2011&quot;&gt;July last year&lt;/a&gt;: both are collaborations like &lt;em&gt;Ambient 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ambient-1music-for-airports-1978&quot;&gt;Ambient 1/Music for Airports (1978)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album was composed from piano and synth parts recorded to tapes that were then allowed to spool at random speeds. This creates the repetition of the motifs in varying and intriguing forms, producing music that is both affecting and humane - something that creates something transcendent out of the spaces between the loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its title, this is music that you can listen to anywhere. Most recently I listened to it on a plane (and not an airport!), it was a night flight and it was the perfect soundtrack to serenely floating over the illuminated cities below. I was distraught when I had to switch off my electronic equipment for landing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ambient-3day-of-radiance-with-laraaji-1980&quot;&gt;Ambient 3/Day of Radiance (with Laraaji) (1980)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambient 3 is probably the least interesting of the albums as it is quite straightforward - divided into &lt;em&gt;Dance&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Meditation&lt;/em&gt; sections, these pieces do exactly what they say on the tin. The &lt;em&gt;Dance&lt;/em&gt; movements are animated and upbeat, while the &lt;em&gt;Meditation&lt;/em&gt; sections are slower and more elongated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not without its charms though. The fact that the dance sections are upbeat mean that they include some of the most compelling music of the series, almost going beyond the overall aesthetic and demanding your attention - the result is cascading, hypnotic and crystalline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ambient-4on-land-1982&quot;&gt;Ambient 4/On Land (1982)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambient 4 is much darker in tone and - perhaps unsurprisingly as the last entry in the series - is the most modern sounding of all the ambient albums. Instead of slowly unfurling loops and motifs of 1 and 2 or the cascading repetitions of 3, we have layers of sounds and noise as shown from the start with &lt;em&gt;Lizard Point&lt;/em&gt;. The subtitle &lt;em&gt;On Land&lt;/em&gt; is apt as throughout movement through landscape is evoked as much as the landscapes themselves. I’m pretty sure that &lt;em&gt;Tal Coat&lt;/em&gt; has been sampled on at least one track by The Orb. Pretty much every track on this album is ambient music par excellence but it is not quite as pretty as Ambient 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-series-in-general&quot;&gt;The Series in General&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, February 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One EP and three albums for Album Digest February 2012:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Burial &lt;em&gt;Kindred EP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;John Talabot &lt;em&gt;fIN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 2 Bears &lt;em&gt;Be Strong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-february-2011&quot;&gt;Last February&lt;/a&gt; was a pretty good month for song based albums, although the likes of Radiohead and James Blake provided plenty of electronic noodling in and around their song structures. (Interestingly, out of the two out-and-out song based albums, one was one of the worst albums of the year and the other one of the best).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something about February that is particularly suited to both brooding shifting electronica and wonky instrumental hip-hop. Perhaps it is the cold or the grey skies or that awful feeling that the new year is not going to be quite as new as you wanted it to be. Despite this rather maudlin realisation, at least music can ride to the rescue. The 2 Bears album is almost designed to be a winter tonic - more of that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;burial-kindred-ep&quot;&gt;Burial &lt;em&gt;Kindred EP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burial’s music is something that I find hard to write about. This might be why new forms of music are so compelling, because the task of writing a description is intellectually stimulating. It can also lead to embarassment if you try too hard and end up writing pretentious dribble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally when it comes to Burial I describe the beats as ‘shuffling’ and usually end up mentioning that the tracks make me think of car journeys as a kid - ones where I would watch the rain fall on the windows and watch the droplets race one another from top to bottom. There is other stuff going on too, particularly in the title track from last year’s EP &lt;em&gt;Street Halo&lt;/em&gt; where all sorts of emotional mayhem unfolds. I came to &lt;em&gt;Street Halo&lt;/em&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/catalog/product/view/id/340/s/fabriclive-59/categories/8/&quot;&gt;Fourtet’s FabricLive mix&lt;/a&gt; and it ended up being the track from that compilation that I put into my 50 Best Songs of 2011 playlist. However in all the tracks, despite the beats and mood being very distinctive there is definitely a ghost in the machine somewhere: some element that makes each track greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt; EP consists of three tracks and comes in at around half an hour with all the tracks being longer than the ones on &lt;em&gt;Untrue&lt;/em&gt;. I cannot say for certain that the sound has changed dramatically since that album but the tracks seem much more weighty and confident. I think that music that is subtle and builds slowly should have the confidence to unfold over a longer span than four or five minutes, so to me the longer tracks are welcome and are easier for me to digest and understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite track is &lt;em&gt;Ashtray Wasp&lt;/em&gt; because although all three tracks are of a piece, this one is probably the most structured and there are some lovely vocal samples throughout that perhaps make it more human than the others. As a partial explanation of why I recently asked whether you can get blue glow sticks, it was this track that inspired the question. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=blue%20glow%20sticks&quot;&gt;Apparently you can&lt;/a&gt;, I just had to frigging google it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always felt an emotional connection when listening to music by Burial (in fact &lt;em&gt;Archangel&lt;/em&gt; is probably one of my favourite pieces of music from the last five years) that is absent when listening to other dubstep artists and the same is true of &lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt; (making for an appropriate title).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-talabot-fin&quot;&gt;John Talabot &lt;em&gt;fIN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more electronica on this next album, one that I went to after reading the review on Pitchfork. The beauty of Spotify is that you can give these albums a try, which is a good thing with Pitchfork who tend to laud great albums a lot of the time but also elevate a lot of pretentious crap too. Sometimes it’s harrowing pretentious crap too, which just makes it worse. Fortunately this album from John Talabot (nope, not even a track on a Fabric comp) is definitely one of their better calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening track &lt;em&gt;Depak Ine&lt;/em&gt; reminds me of something and it really bugs me that I can’t place it. The track itself slowly grows out of animal noises and through various layers of synths, simple and insistent. At about 3:40 it becomes this weird Enigma-like piece before a much more strident beat kicks in a minute later. It sounds completely different from the Burial tracks but like most of the tracks on &lt;em&gt;Fin&lt;/em&gt; it sits nicely alongside them. The sounds and beats seem to take inspiration from late 80s and early 90s sounds, bands like Erasure and Depeche Mode. Despite having the potential to not be very fashionable, it actually all gets mixed up in to a very stylish track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole album plays out like a tasteful patchwork of albums and artists that I love. &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; sounds like it could have come off a hybrid of the first two Junior Boys albums (the layers of the first matched to the warmth and directness of the second). &lt;em&gt;El Oeste&lt;/em&gt; builds out of a weird loop that sounds like something off of Philip Glass’s &lt;em&gt;Einstein On The Beach&lt;/em&gt; mixed with Mike Oldfield’s soundtrack to &lt;em&gt;The Killing Fields&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Oro y Sangre&lt;/em&gt; is probably how New Order might have sounded around &lt;em&gt;Technique&lt;/em&gt; if they’d experimented with steel drums and tried to ape 808 State. Perhaps the track is not actually as good as that would really sound but it’s a pretty captivating instrumental. Unfortunately there are mis-steps, &lt;em&gt;Missing You&lt;/em&gt; sounds like a bad joke though it does have a pretty nifty beat behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s well paced, engaging and entertaining. Like I said above, I knew nothing about this guy before I set ears on this on Spotify via the Pitchfork. It shows how great Spotify is as a risk-free music discovery application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lilacs--champagne-lilacs--champagne&quot;&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I discovered &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt; for myself, seeing its weird artwork on &lt;a href=&quot;www.bleep.com&quot;&gt;bleep&lt;/a&gt; while I was buying the Burial EP there. I am a sucker for trippy absinthe pictures with big eye in them. A quick search on Spotify found it and I’ve given it such heavy rotation that I have pre-ordered a physical copy ahead of its UK release next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best listened to as a whole, it’s a wonderful sample-based instrumental hip-hop record and to my mind on a par with DJ Shadow’s two highlights &lt;em&gt;Endtroducing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Private Press&lt;/em&gt;. Please bear in mind that I am no expert in these matters though, I’m just telling you what my ears like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a great album for walking home from work in the amber streetlights - all those cold nights in recent weeks were perfect, it’s the best sort of music to listen to while your breath streams out in front of you and dances in front of your face. Of course this is probably because it is a great album to &lt;em&gt;smoke&lt;/em&gt; to, if you catch my drift. The only thing ‘wrong’ with it is that it only lasts thirty five minutes but at least that way it does not overstay its welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that this is going to be one of my favourites come the end of the year. Apparently the guys who made it also record as a band called Grails, you can bet that I am definitely going to check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-2-bears-be-strong&quot;&gt;The 2 Bears &lt;em&gt;Be Strong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formed from one of Hot Chip and Raf Rundell, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the2bears.co.uk/&quot;&gt;The 2 Bears&lt;/a&gt; were always going to be a fantastic listen. From my point of view it’s because Hot Chip are one of the best bands currently going and are hugely underrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with a cool instrumental called &lt;em&gt;The Birds And The Bees&lt;/em&gt;, the title track then appears with some great lyrics “Some people tell what to listen to / Spend the whole time saying this and that is cool / You … got to find a sound that stays inside for you” and the best roll call of namechecks since LCD Soundsystem’s &lt;em&gt;Losing My Edge&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile the whole track and the following &lt;em&gt;Bear Hug&lt;/em&gt; echo the sounds of that wonderful era between 1991 and 1993 that produced so many songs (mostly from Europe) that cross pollinated pop music and dance music. And of course any record that can introduce one of Joe Goddard’s sweet verses at the drop of a hat is going to make me swoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I thought “OK this is a perfect storm of things I like but it can’t really have longevity, it’s just a novelty” but those wonderful house pianos on &lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt;, the sweetly folky &lt;em&gt;Time In Mind&lt;/em&gt; (I really thought it was Billy Bragg at first) and the strangely affecting chorus of &lt;em&gt;Take A Look Around&lt;/em&gt; (not to mention the amazing Robert Owens style backing track). There won’t be no problems if you just move your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect after work soundtrack then &lt;em&gt;Be Strong&lt;/em&gt; is definitely one for the walk to work, if only because all the upbeat numbers tend to get cut off with the more maudlin &lt;em&gt;Time In Mind&lt;/em&gt; by the time I am swiping my pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-digest-february-2012---summary&quot;&gt;Album Digest February 2012 - Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the month I really wasn’t sure if there would be many good albums to write about this month: how wrong I was! Next month, there’s the new Fanfarlo album at least and likely much more. I am off to see Fanfarlo live tomorrow, something that I am very excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Never Mind The Ballards</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/never-mind-the-ballards"/>
   <updated>2012-02-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/never-mind-the-ballards</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;j-g-ballard&quot;&gt;Ages ago&lt;/a&gt; I set out to write a post for each of JG Ballard’s novels. In fact it is the oldest post on this blog. Most of the novels (I don’t have the two autobiographical novels &lt;em&gt;Empire Of The Sun&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Kindness Of Women&lt;/em&gt; and the late period novel &lt;em&gt;Milennium People&lt;/em&gt;) are sat in a row on top of my broken bookshelf, part of the weight there that bowed outer frame of the unit and made the inner shelves collapse. Had I known that it would be a task unfinished nearly eighteen months later and destroy a piece a furniture that I did not yet own, I may have been less ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sequence of posts I reached &lt;a href=&quot;concrete-island&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in June last year but the next in the sequence &lt;em&gt;High-Rise&lt;/em&gt; puts me off. It is the last of three rather gruelling novels that starts with &lt;a href=&quot;crash&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Like those other two books I tried to read it when I was younger, but the world that Ballard wrote about in these books doesn’t really exist anymore (or rather the worlds that he writes about are no longer alternatives to the one we live in now) and this makes them difficult for me to fathom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;em&gt;High Rise&lt;/em&gt; though, I know that things will get easier. I have already read &lt;em&gt;The Unlimited Dream Company&lt;/em&gt; and it is a great book. The novels after that one are all new to me but each strikes me as having an interesting premise, whether they all keep their more lurid elements in check remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that makes me reticent about holding forth on the Ballard novels again is that in writing about and researching the books I have come across a large number of people doing the same thing. They all seem to get it too. Compared to this I feel rather intimidated by the fact that I often find the books rather confusing - my mind boggles at the thought of people who can devour them and seemingly understand and memorise all the details. What I can delight in is the language used and with the problematic &lt;em&gt;High-Rise&lt;/em&gt; I may simply present some close readings of some sections of the novel. That way I can avoid reading too much of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of this story is that it is probably better to read for personal pleasure than as an intellectual exercise. Well, duh! It seems incredibly stupid to type that now but there you go: you live and you learn.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, January 2012</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2012"/>
   <updated>2012-01-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five albums to see in the new year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FOE “Bad Dream Hotline”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leila “U &amp;amp; I”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Diagrams “Black Light”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pyramids &amp;amp; Horseback “A Throne Without A King”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FabricLive 61 mixed by Pinch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foe-bad-dream-hotline&quot;&gt;FOE &lt;em&gt;Bad Dream Hotline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to “Bad Dream Hotline” about four times thinking “who does her voice remind me of?”. In the end I realised it was Sophie Ellis-Bextor, though in parts she sounds like KT Tunstall too. Of course these are rather tame references and I don’t mean to damn with faint praise, this album is much more edgy than those two ever were. If you are after some girly power pop with a darker edge then this will no doubt be the album that you have been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the lyrics are enjoyable and are mostly wry observations about the kind of pop culture that generates shows like &lt;em&gt;The X Factor&lt;/em&gt;. Probably the best of these songs is &lt;em&gt;Tyrant Song&lt;/em&gt; with its line “Too many nights sucking sweets / makes your head spin” and the rest of the song gleefully grinds through childhood tales of bed-wetting and playground teasing before culminating in a weird cut up outro that sounds as though it was made from the same samples as used on DJ Shadow’s &lt;em&gt;The Private Press&lt;/em&gt;. These little details are everywhere on the album and make it a pleasure to listen to. The other nice feature that I haven’t really heard on an album for a while is the way that most of the songs are sung in the round and fragments of the lyrics get diced up and reassembled to create variations. It keeps you on your toes when you attempt to sing along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tracks like &lt;em&gt;Ballad For The Brainkeepers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Get Money&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cold Hard Rock&lt;/em&gt; are excellent, all could be singles and would sound fantastic in the cheery parallel world where I run all the radio stations. I really hope that the songs can get a bit of traction because they really are great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite track is &lt;em&gt;The Black Lodge&lt;/em&gt; (sample lyric: “There’s a breeze in the trees singing your black heart / your black heart needs a transplant / bad luck has ground you down / down in the mud where the worms spin round and round”) but it all rushes by so quickly I keep finding new delights in it including those cut up lyrics I mentioned. It tells the story of a little boy, a little girl and a little old toy who get lost in the woods and are rescued by a witch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leila-u--i&quot;&gt;Leila &lt;em&gt;U &amp;amp; I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good stuff. The collaborations with Mt. Sims are reminiscent of his work with The Knife on their Darwin opera &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow In A Year&lt;/em&gt; and are slightly better than something like &lt;em&gt;Hailin From The Edge&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Walls&lt;/em&gt; by Apparat. Personally I prefer the instrumental tracks and I was interested to read a review elsewhere that claimed that her first two albums are better. Given that I enjoyed this one a lot, I look forward to tracking the other two down (&lt;em&gt;Like Weather&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Other One&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the vocal tracks, I like &lt;em&gt;Welcome To Your Life&lt;/em&gt; the most - it’s an intense track that is ideal to have blaring on your headphones as you arrive at work. Elsewhere the vocals are also used as mere samples on tracks like &lt;em&gt;Colony Collapse Disorder&lt;/em&gt; and the title track. I should also mention the single &lt;em&gt;Disappointed Cloud (anyway)&lt;/em&gt;, which is really interesting and sounds like the sort of track that will really grow on me if I give it the chance. Full disclosure: all albums this month apart from the Pinch comp were bought or streamed after the 23rd so I haven’t had much chance to get used to them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a lot of fun guessing the samples and influences on this album. The last track &lt;em&gt;Forasmuch&lt;/em&gt; seems to sample Mike Oldfield’s &lt;em&gt;Étude&lt;/em&gt; from the soundtrack to &lt;em&gt;The Killing Fields&lt;/em&gt; (admittedly just one note!); and &lt;em&gt;Activate I&lt;/em&gt; reminds me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Tension&lt;/em&gt;, the opening track from Orbital’s &lt;em&gt;The Altogether&lt;/em&gt; album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diagrams-black-light&quot;&gt;Diagrams &lt;em&gt;Black Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Nothing else matters / Nothing else matters at all”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sort-of solo album by one of the members of Tuung, a band who I know practically nothing about save for a copy of one of their albums loaned to me by a work colleague. I must admit that I let that one pass over me a bit but I did like it enough to be curious when one song came up at random on my iTunes library’s shuffle. They sound a bit like Gomez for people who buy organic vegetables and know what quinoa is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Light&lt;/em&gt; though is a little more straightforward than Tuung and like the FOE album, it’s refreshing to have another album that is enjoyable on the surface and that also rewards closer listening. For the most part, the songs are happy and wistful. The arrangements are mostly designed to foreground a soft folky voice that takes in a great number of influences. I knew I should have written down a list because I had loads of comparisons and now I can only think of Paul Simon and Beck (I’m being really MOR with my comparisons this month!). Oh, there’s a Sufjan Stevens-y bit on one of the tracks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the music, there’s some satisfying and squelchy synth work on most tracks but the bonus track, a “Disco Bloodbath” remix of standout track &lt;em&gt;Night All Night&lt;/em&gt; that is aimed squarely at the dance floor, shows the rest of the electronic touches as being for decoration rather than propulsion. The lyrics are interesting but much more a patchwork of different elements: from the thrilling excitement of the closing lines of &lt;em&gt;Tall Buildings&lt;/em&gt; (“Hexagon! Pentagon! Triangle! Square!”) to the throwaway &lt;em&gt;Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn&lt;/em&gt; reference on &lt;em&gt;Night All Night&lt;/em&gt; (“It’s a sleep worm inside the skull / soft mouth on your brain stem”) via the existential lovestruck words of the title track (“If I can glue myself, the past and future killed / If I can lose myself then lose myself I will / Nothing else matters / Nothing else matters at all”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice solid album and great for the remaining nights of walking home in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pyramids--horseback-a-throne-without-a-king&quot;&gt;Pyramids &amp;amp; Horseback &lt;em&gt;A Throne Without A King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit that I didn’t buy this album. I was rather tempted by rather the smart yellow and black cover though. After listening to it on Spotify I was a bit too scared and weirded out. I am very impressed that it was on Spotify in the first place (The Leila album wasn’t though). Last year I celebrated five years on last.fm; well, one of the first things I got into there was &lt;strong&gt;dark ambient&lt;/strong&gt;, at least until it really started to creep me out. I don’t pretend to be an expert but to my mind dark ambient is about taking unsettling noise and making it even more unsettling. In some ways, metal does the same thing to rock music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incredibly creepy and challenging album consists of one track from each of the two bands and then a collaboration between the two bands called &lt;em&gt;A Throne Without A King&lt;/em&gt;, which is divided into four parts and lasts three quarters of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is that creepy and I didn’t buy it, why do I mention it? Well, in parts it is quite spectacular. There are some really creepy spoken word parts on part one, though I have no idea what is being said - it makes me think of one of the pieces I saw at the Hayward’s Psycho Buildings exhibition. The installation was called &lt;em&gt;To The Memory of H.P. Lovecraft&lt;/em&gt; and it was by Mike Nelson: a room with chipboard walls that appear to have been destroyed by either some supernatural or insane force; it was fascinating and creepy. Well, &lt;em&gt;A Throne Without A King&lt;/em&gt; for me is the aural equivalent of that exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fabriclive-61-mixed-by-pinch&quot;&gt;FabricLive 61 mixed by Pinch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mix brings together two tracks from the &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-december-2011&quot;&gt;December 2011 album digest&lt;/a&gt; - one by Pinch &amp;amp; Shackleton (&lt;em&gt;Rooms Within A Room&lt;/em&gt;) and one by Emika (Pinch’s remix of &lt;em&gt;Double Edge&lt;/em&gt; - the track of hers that I really should have put on my 50 Songs from 2011 playlist.) - and a whole lot more besides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said in the December 2011 digest that I would go back to Shackleton’s fabric mix and to be honest it was fine enough but perhaps about fifteen minutes too long - though my patience was probably worn a little thin by the fact that I was listening to it while on a two mile walk through some rather permeating drizzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mix is another matter entirely: propulsive, entertaining and stacked with music that you will want to track down afterwards. It seems that Fabric are on a bit of a run at the moment with other entries by Fourtet and Visionquest both being very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special mention for the artwork, it’s brilliant isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #15: Début by Björk</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-15"/>
   <updated>2012-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-15</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got into Début via a cassette from the library, much like I did with &lt;a href=&quot;uc1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together Alone&lt;/em&gt; by Crowded House&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose it is less obscure than many of my choices for &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;this strand&lt;/a&gt; but I do think that &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; is more well-known (because of &lt;em&gt;It’s Oh So Quiet&lt;/em&gt;, which we shall mention here only briefly) and that &lt;em&gt;Homogenic&lt;/em&gt; is probably more popular among her fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really like about &lt;em&gt;Début&lt;/em&gt; though, as much as the album itself, is the panoply of remixes and alternative versions that surround the release. In this way &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; is at least as strong if not stronger and you might recall that I had similar fun &lt;a href=&quot;uc13&quot;&gt;when writing about the Orb’s album U.F.Orb a while back&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of this, there will be some detours into the remixes and live versions when discussing this album. In particular, I will mention the remix collection &lt;em&gt;the best mixes from the album début for all the people who don’t buy white labels&lt;/em&gt; and the recording of an MTV Unplugged show that is available in the &lt;em&gt;Live Box&lt;/em&gt; box set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First though, we should focus on the sun at the centre of this solar system of tracks, remixes, b-sides, beats, croons and tunes. Yes, the album itself. I really like &lt;em&gt;Début&lt;/em&gt; over the other Bjork albums because I can see the story running through it much more clearly in this one over all the others. It is my reading of it of course but I see it as the tale of someone who comes to the city (&lt;em&gt;Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crying&lt;/em&gt;), falls in love ecstatically  (&lt;em&gt;Venus As A Boy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;There’s More To Life Than This&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Like Someone In Love&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Big Time Sensuality&lt;/em&gt;), peaks and becomes content (&lt;em&gt;One Day&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Aeroplane&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Come To Me&lt;/em&gt;), before breaking up (&lt;em&gt;Violently Happy&lt;/em&gt;) and reaching some sort of inner peace as a single person (&lt;em&gt;Anchor Song&lt;/em&gt;). Of course, nearly all versions of the album now have &lt;em&gt;Play Dead&lt;/em&gt; on at the end and I like to swap its place as last track with &lt;em&gt;Anchor Song&lt;/em&gt; so that it fits my story board a bit better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-beginning&quot;&gt;In the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found the musical arrangement on &lt;em&gt;Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; rather unconventional, to this day I can’t quite figure out what is going on in the album version. On the unplugged CD, there is a prominent harpsichord but I can’t find it in the album version. Whatever the very minimal backing actually comprises, it certainly does the job of foregrounding her immense vocal performance - in the seconds up to the (0:50) point when she yodels “Anxiety” for the first time, the map of dance music, pop music and rock music gets changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to that, the next track &lt;em&gt;Crying&lt;/em&gt; is a little less interesting. It is a slightly more pedestrian retread through the same ideas both musically and lyrically (moving the focus of uncertainty from humans generally to an absent lover specifically), one of those songs that are in between A and B on great albums. To my knowledge, there are no remixes of &lt;em&gt;Crying&lt;/em&gt; and that seems a little strange because if it has one thing for it, it has a very remixable little riff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venus As A Boy&lt;/em&gt; though is a palpable hit with its lyrics of naïve sexual adventure backed by that eggshell beat and those indian strings. Perhaps I only say “eggshell beat” because of the video but it feels right somehow. I can still remember seeing the video for the first time on the &lt;em&gt;ITV Chart Show&lt;/em&gt; (there was still no MTV for most of us back in 1993!) and there is something sexy about her cooking those eggs - it has stayed with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-gimmicks&quot;&gt;Some gimmicks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two songs are a bit gimmicky. First &lt;em&gt;There’s More To Life (Than This)&lt;/em&gt; is a song set in the toilets of the The Milk Bar (according to the album’s sleeve) where in a respite from the night’s clubbing, Bjork rattles off her desire to go off and bag some bread for breakfast. I think we’ve all been there! These days I like the song more than I initially did, when I was younger I did prefer the clubby sections to the a cappella interlude in the toilet. On the &lt;em&gt;Venus As A Boy&lt;/em&gt; single there is a (hilariously titled) “non-toilet” version of the song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;em&gt;Like Someone In Love&lt;/em&gt;, a cover of a show tune and another showcase for her voice. However, it suffers in comparison to her next stab at a cover - her incomparable version of &lt;em&gt;It’s Oh So Quiet&lt;/em&gt;.  It is a little understated - all harpsichords and cartoon deer - and trips up the pace of the album a bit. It presages the voice and harpsichord aesthetic of her later live gigs and her collaborations with Zeena Perkins around the time of release of &lt;em&gt;Vespertine&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;em&gt;Generous Palmstrokes&lt;/em&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Hidden Place&lt;/em&gt; CD single).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plateau&quot;&gt;The plateau&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;em&gt;Big Time Sensuality&lt;/em&gt; has pumped things up again (be sure to check out the awesome remixes by Fluke on the single), we hit a more relaxed section of the recorded. While &lt;em&gt;One Day&lt;/em&gt; could be directed toward to a lover, it seems more likely addressed to a child (the samples of baby talk and the storytelling lyric). It’s a languorous and ambient pop song that slowly and beautifully unfolds over its five minutes. There are some great remixes by the Sabres of Paradise and a bit later in 1996 or so, another great mix by Trevor Morais was included on the &lt;em&gt;Possibly Maybe EP&lt;/em&gt;. On MTV Unplugged, it gets spun out nicely too with an intro played on what sound like wine glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aeroplane&lt;/em&gt; is a little more wonky, all jazzy struts and perhaps an overenthusiastic vocal: it is probably the song that conforms to all the stereotypes that people who dislike Bjork’s music profess to hate. Personally, I would not actively seek it out to listen to but I rarely skip it when I am listening to the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come To Me&lt;/em&gt; is my favourite song on the album, a sweet soaring vocal backed up by an interesting beat (with tablas! Awesome!) and sweet strings. I think I would love to dance to this with someone. In fact like &lt;em&gt;One Day&lt;/em&gt; it could be sung to a child as much as it could to a lover, there is a nice ambiguity to the lyrics. There is a great remix of it by The Black Dog that features on &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; singles &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the remix album, I definitely regard it as her “lost single”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ending&quot;&gt;The ending&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Violently Happy&lt;/em&gt; is the dark twin sister of &lt;em&gt;Big Time Sensuality&lt;/em&gt; and I think it details the end of a failing relationship and not the sustaining of a happy one. There is that dissonance between “violent” and “happy”. The remixes are all pretty obvious apart from the one by Graham Massey (a member of 808 State, he is therefore one of my personal heroes) because the beat pretty much dominates the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing out the canonical version of the album, we have &lt;em&gt;The Anchor Song&lt;/em&gt;, which like “Aeroplane” is a rather jazzy number but I am such a musical philistine that I cannot tell you if that is a sax or a trumpet she’s exchanging her powerful vocal throes with. It’s all atmosphere and that is why it succeeds where &lt;em&gt;Aeroplane&lt;/em&gt; fails, the instrumentation makes you feel like you are sinking down into either the deep water or, more likely, deep sleep. Again there is a fantastic version by The Black Dog with most of the live instrumentation replaced by an insistent electronic throb. Numerous full-throated live versions abound, there are three on the &lt;em&gt;Live Box&lt;/em&gt; box set alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally &lt;em&gt;Play Dead&lt;/em&gt; is the best bonus track on any album ever. A collaboration with David Arnold for the forgotten film &lt;em&gt;The Young Americans&lt;/em&gt; and produced by &lt;a href=&quot;uc14&quot;&gt;Bomb The Bass&lt;/a&gt; big cheese Tim Simenon, it roars out of the speakers with a boldness that is missing from the rest of the songs on Début (because most do not need it). It (and perhaps &lt;em&gt;It’s Oh So Quiet&lt;/em&gt; later) presents an interesting glimpse at an alternate universe in which Bjork allied her voice to generic but well-crafted pop songs and became the biggest voice in the universe. Despite  &lt;em&gt;Play Dead&lt;/em&gt; is an awesome tune, we are probably all glad that did not actually happen and that she got to make iPad apps with David Attenborough instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-word-or-two-on-remixes&quot;&gt;A word or two on remixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remixes worth noting (some have been mentioned above). The Underworld remix of &lt;em&gt;Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; (12:07) is a 12 minute builder that wraps fragments of the vocal around the bass drum figure, while the Bassheads’ version (Edit, 6:32) of the same track takes a more direct approach that sounds a little more dated now. Of all the remixes of &lt;em&gt;One Day&lt;/em&gt; that were released under the radar, the “Springs Eternal” (9:47) version is probably the best - taking a top down approach and exploding all the elements, it’s very spare and ambient but is in no way as noodly as all that sounds. If you want something a bit more intense the “Adrenalin - Far Removed” (9:02) version is pretty hyper but it also sounds a bit passé. When it comes to the more poppy tracks, with &lt;em&gt;Big Time Sensuality&lt;/em&gt; you want the remixes by Fluke - both the 7” (4:11) and the two 12” (5:52, 5:44) versions are great - and possibly the Dom T. version (6:10) as well. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Violently Happy&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t fare so well at the wheels of steel but Massey’s “Other mix” (7:23) does go to some pretty interesting places.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Painter</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-painter"/>
   <updated>2012-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-painter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a man who loved to paint. He studied the art and craft of painting for many years. He chose to invest his time and energy into creating the most realistic portraits that he could paint. For him the joy came not from completing the paintings but the process of recreating the real world with the strokes of his brush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years he continued to study the art of painting. He learned new techniques for abstracting from reality but he always favoured the realism above all else. Meanwhile, his friends and family mocked him and said that he would always be a poor boy who loved to paint but could not make money from it. He had no answer to this criticism, the satisfaction he gained from applying the brush to the canvas was to great to worry about whether his paintings would be finished or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, news came one day from a faraway kingdom of a king who wanted a landscape painted so that his subjects might know and love the land from which they came. The boy packed his paints up into a small bag and borrowed some money to get to the capital city so that he persuade the king’s council to let him paint the painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough he managed to persuade the king to commission him to paint the landscape. It was the happiest day of the man’s life. He sighed contentedly to himself and said “Finally, I can call myself a painter! I will dedicate myself to creating the most amazing painting of the kingdom so that all who see it will love and understand their king and country!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He borrowed yet more money and took up lodgings on the periphery of the capital city. However, when he showed up to court and asked to be taken to the view that his patrons wished painted he was told that he could only paint the landscape as it was described to him by others. He thought this was very strange for how could he paint something true to life without sight of the landscape that he was being paid to paint?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sat despondently in his chair, slumped in front of the easel with his brush hovering in the air over the canvas. He tried but could not paint. All the joy of painting was taken from him as he tried to contemplate the task of painting another person’s perception of reality, all without sight of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon a kindly looking old man wandered by and said “you look sad, have this!” The older man passed the confused painter another canvas with a magnificent scene drawn upon it in lines. There were symbols in the spaces between the lines to show the colours that should be painted there. “This isn’t what you have to paint” the old man said “but it is a start.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course, you’ll need completely different colours to those mentioned here as well but I am sure that now I have given you this you’ll have your landscape completed in no time at all!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The painter smiled. It certainly was a start. Perhaps it was not the one that he would have wanted to make but it certainly helped him to feel less despondent. The idea of simply painting between the lines after all the time and hardship taken to learn his craft was a little humiliating but feeling insecure around those who had walked the corridors of the palace so long, he felt that he had little choice but to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If I change this scene and its colours as you suggest, I doubt it shall look very realistic and realism is my passion, the very reason for my painting” said the painter to the old man. “Well”, the old man replied, “you can always paint a more realistic version of this painting once you have done your colouring in”. The old man scratched his nose and pointed toward the throne. “After all, it is best to show them pretty quickly what it is that you can do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“OK, I agree” said the painter, “thank you for your help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(To be continued)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dreams Of A Life: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/dreams-of-a-life-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2012-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/dreams-of-a-life-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreams Of A Life&lt;/em&gt; is a documentary about Joyce Vincent, a woman who was found in her flat three years after her death surrounded by wrapped christmas presents and with the TV still on. £2400 in arrears on her rent, she was discovered by bailiffs who forced the door down. The film attempts to work out happened to Joyce by interviewing people who knew her. In two other strands that unfold in parallel, various events from her life are re-enacted along with the clearing of her flat by forensics officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a fascinating film. It is very touching and not just in its consideration of what happened to Joyce but also to the people that she knew. It is also a film about more than just an unnoticed death, it is also about the role every one of plays in each others lives. It also spans sexual, racial and work place politics. Most of all, it tells a story and highlights the failings of human memory as it does so. There is a great moment where a clip of her voice is played to the people who knew her and their responses are completely different: things like “the first bit is her real voice” compared to “she’s mucking around in that first bit”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still trying to piece together what it all means. I expect I shall be for a while yet, such was the strangeness and complexity of the tale. It certainly touched a nerve with me, bringing back memories of how in September 2009 I sat at Mill Hill Broadway station and wrote down a list of things I could do to “disappear”: a relationship was ending, I was stressed at work and I was lonely. Later though, once I felt better, I managed to do pretty much the opposite of almost everything on that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I am not so sure that something like this could ever happen again – not now that we have Facebook and things but then people probably thought that about mobile phones and e-mail back in 2003. As a result, I resolve to get in touch with some friends that I haven’t seen for a while and find out how they are getting on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, December 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-december-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-12-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-december-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some rather brief pen pictures of this month’s albums. I’ve been a bit busy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;radio-slave---collected-remixes&quot;&gt;Radio Slave - Collected Remixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thud thud thud. This is pretty much how all Radio Slave remixes go. I really liked his fabric mix and borrowed a few tracks for &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/10/playlist-2-dancing-in-space/&quot;&gt;my second playlist&lt;/a&gt; a while back. Anyway, back to the thudding: it’s no bad thing, the remixes have a nice formula that works well for discovering new tracks like UNKLE’s &lt;em&gt;Burn My Shadow&lt;/em&gt; (Ian Astbury’s vocal is given plenty of room to shine) and K3’s &lt;em&gt;Play To Win&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On more abstract, instrumental tracks the blueprint can lead to an experience that is more robust than it is fun - but only after several such tracks in a row. The action is aimed squarely at the floor but the sequencing does break proceedings up with vocal tracks in such a way that you could probably work to it or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Works-Remixes-2006-2010-Radio-Slave/dp/B005KOZLHS/&quot;&gt;The anthology spans 3 CDs, 20 artists and nearly four hours&lt;/a&gt; (the shortest track is 7:43, half are over ten minutes long), which for £8.99 is great value but like all such collections it is to be taken in small doses (see also the completely different and yet analogous &lt;em&gt;Orphans&lt;/em&gt; compilation from Tom Waits &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-november-2011&quot;&gt;that I mentioned in passing last month&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pinch--shackleton---eponymous&quot;&gt;Pinch &amp;amp; Shackleton - Eponymous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the first of two eponymous albums this month. As I said, the Radio Slave collection is definitely aimed at the floor but the P&amp;amp;S album is aimed somewhere a little more abstract. I wasn’t sure what to expect of this album, having only listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/catalog/product/view/id/210/s/fabric-55/categories/8/&quot;&gt;Shackleton’s fabric mix&lt;/a&gt; once or twice (although it is helpfully comprised entirely of his own tracks, so I could have researched more thoroughly). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/catalog/product/view/id/374/s/fabriclive-61/categories/8/&quot;&gt;Pinch’s FabricLive mix&lt;/a&gt; should be dropping into my letterbox early in January so no help there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered Shackleton’s fabric mix as being somewhat ethereal and spooky, there was a track with someone reading quotes from the bible that gave me goosebumps. The P&amp;amp;S album begins in a similar vein, &lt;em&gt;Cracks In The Pleasuredome&lt;/em&gt; is also space, hiss and footsteps for nearly minutes before the beats and the vocal samples kick in. What starts as a curiosity ends as a rather compelling listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere I was reminded of &lt;em&gt;Future Sound Of London&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Torn And Submerged&lt;/em&gt;, about halfway through it could be something straight off &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discogs.com/FSOL-ISDN/release/6007&quot;&gt;ISDN&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile the vocal samples at the start of &lt;em&gt;Selfish Greedy Life&lt;/em&gt; recall tracks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChdunFBYW3M&quot;&gt;I Wish I Had Duck Feet&lt;/a&gt; off Orbital’s &lt;em&gt;Snivilisation&lt;/em&gt; album. While the tracks aren’t as long as on the Radio Slave comp, each gets plenty of time to develop and they usually twist and develop into different shapes as the runtime progresses. My favourite is probably &lt;em&gt;Monks On The Rum&lt;/em&gt; (I included it on the Albums of 2011 playlist), which when it came up at random on my iPod’s song shuffle I immediately identified as being off P&amp;amp;S (having heard the album twice!). It’s another nice little mood piece, a bit like one of the more atmospheric tracks off Red Snapper’s &lt;em&gt;We Aim To Satisfy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think if I bother to write down my ten favourite albums this year, I shall probably put &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-august-2011&quot;&gt;N-Plants by Biosphere&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the list because it’s a very satisfying electronic album that aims for the head rather than the feet. While you can certainly dance to some bits of the P&amp;amp;S album, it is definitely squarely aimed at a similar head space as &lt;em&gt;N-Plants&lt;/em&gt; and had I heard it sooner, it probably would have become a firm favourite too. I shall definitely keep it close by in the new year; I also look forward to rediscovering Shackleton’s fabric mix and to hearing Pinch’s FabricLive mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emika---eponymous&quot;&gt;Emika - Eponymous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came highly recommended and my first thought on hearing it was that it sounded exactly as one hoped last year’s &lt;em&gt;Heligoland&lt;/em&gt; from Massive Attack would sound. I would easily swap &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858817923/&quot;&gt;Flat Of The Blade&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Double Edge&lt;/em&gt;, a song on this album that seems to cover the same ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thought was to compare with &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-april-2011&quot;&gt;Katy B’s album “On A Mission” that I wrote about in April&lt;/a&gt;, this is less accessible but altogether more satisfying. There is still the focus on relationships (usually going very badly) in the lyrics but the music and production are altogether more innovative and punchy. While Katy B’s songs are slicked in urban radio sheen, the songs on &lt;em&gt;Emika&lt;/em&gt; are genuinely grimy and tick with a similar precision and darkness to those on the &lt;em&gt;Pinch &amp;amp; Shackleton&lt;/em&gt; album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 Hours&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Double Edge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pretend&lt;/em&gt; are probably worth the cover price alone but it’s all good, smooth enough to listen to in passing but also enough detail to be interesting when paid attention to. There’s something of Portishead about &lt;em&gt;The Long Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; and in a genuine way too, that wish for these tracks to have been part of &lt;em&gt;Heligoland&lt;/em&gt; weren’t just trite lip service. If Massive Attack really are going to make another album (who can really be sure?) they should sign her up.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Amber World</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My earliest memory is waking up in Queen Alexandra hospital in Cosham after an operation on my ears. I must have been about four years old and it was the middle of the night. I was in a room on my own and the door was locked. It had been daylight only seconds before so I got out of the bed and walked to the window to look incredulously out at the amber world that lay beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can remember the stillness of it, the feeling that no one else was around and that the world had somehow forgotten me. I remember the magical loneliness of being the only person awake as far as I could see. I don’t know what happened next, I must have just gone back to the bed and fallen asleep again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still love being alone in the dark. Sleeplessness is often frustrating but sometimes I will just sit by the window in the dark looking out at the orange glow of the streets, listening to stray cars padding past and wondering about the stories that might be sending people out on the road in the early morning. I think about the dreams of the people sleeping in their beds and I try to look for lit windows, for someone who might be doing the same as me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bath, I lived in a flat on the London Road with a window that looked out over St Stephen’s Church and Larkhall stretched up the hill behind. I remember hot summer nights in 2006 looking out of that window and up the hill. I can think about the search for lit windows and the five years between then and now dissolve in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I think there is a part of me still stuck inside that room in the hospital, stuck back there at the beginning. Every time I find solace in being alone I am escaping back to that night and to the amber world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, November 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-november-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-november-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just three albums this month as I’ve been listening to a lot of Brian Eno records ready for an upcoming understated classic. First up is &lt;em&gt;50 Words For Snow&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Kate Bush&lt;/strong&gt;, the second album that she has released this year. &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-may-2011&quot;&gt;Back in May&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, which presented re-recorded and re-mastered versions of songs from her albums &lt;em&gt;The Sensual World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt;. This time around it is an album of brand new material, the first since &lt;em&gt;Aerial&lt;/em&gt; in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ariel was divided into two discs and &lt;em&gt;50 Words For Snow&lt;/em&gt; is similar to both &lt;em&gt;A Sea Of Honey&lt;/em&gt; (discrete songs) and &lt;em&gt;A Sky Of Honey&lt;/em&gt; (a thematically linked suite of songs). It’s a smart move to release such a wintry album just as the weather starts to get really cold. Listening to the opening track &lt;em&gt;Snowflake&lt;/em&gt; while walking home in the dark and cold mist the other night was a surreal and beautiful experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first three songs languidly sprawl over thirty-four minutes, just like so much snow over the hillsides, streets and houses. The pace perfectly evokes the sense of a landscape held completely still by the elements. It really reminds me of last year when so much of the landscape around me was hit by a blast of snow that seemed to come out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the album comprises four slightly shorter tracks (with an average run time of about seven and a half minutes) that are a bit more disparate in terms of arrangement, if not theme. Three of the songs are about winter or snow: &lt;em&gt;Wild Man&lt;/em&gt; (the abominable snowman used as metaphor for elusive celebrity just as a still-alive Elvis was on &lt;em&gt;King Of The Mountain&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Aerial&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;50 Words For Snow&lt;/em&gt; (Stephen Fry forced to list 50 words for snow, as though Kate has held up an edition of QI) and &lt;em&gt;Among Angels&lt;/em&gt; (a sweet closer that seems to celebrate that peculiar darkness that falls on a snowy night). Meanwhile &lt;em&gt;Snowed In At Wheeler Street&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps the runt of the litter, crow-barring a snow reference into a song that features Elton John’s voice going from interesting to kaput in about three verses. It somehow manages to be simultaneously more odd and less believable than &lt;em&gt;Misty&lt;/em&gt;, a song from the first half of the album that details a one night stand with a snowman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very difficult to make a winter album that is separate from Christmas and this has led to some bloody awful albums over the years (with Michael Bublé and Justin Bieber continuing this “noble” tradition this year), so it is really nice to come across one that captures the season consummately without resorting to bells or mentions of holly etc. It will be hard to listen to it after February next year but I don’t doubt that it will also be one to dig out and treasure next year once the frosts start to bite and that bloody Slade song is back in rotation in the shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;em&gt;New Blood&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Peter Gabriel&lt;/strong&gt;, which much like Kate Bush’s &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; revisits and repackages old material, this time with the aid of a full orchestra. The selection ranges over his entire career and is not exclusively based on his biggest hits, the intersection with his recent greatest hits compilation is quite small. Besides these are new recordings and it probably helps the exercise if there is a bit of unfamiliarity. Hence we get two songs (well one is an instrumental) from &lt;em&gt;OVO&lt;/em&gt;, the soundtrack for the central show at the Millennium Dome, and one from &lt;em&gt;Up&lt;/em&gt;, the last studio album that eventually trickled out of Box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless the track listing is dominated by songs from the middle of his career with four from &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt; and three from &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; (AKA &lt;em&gt;Security&lt;/em&gt;) and as these are probably the best seven songs, it is no surprise that they feature the best arrangements. &lt;em&gt;Red Rain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mercy Street&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Don’t Give Up&lt;/em&gt; probably have the safest arrangements of all but there is no sin in delivering great songs in a straightforward fashion. &lt;em&gt;San Jacinto&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps remarkable because of how well the jittery Fairlight sounds of the original are converted to the orchestral arrangement. The jewel in the crown though is &lt;em&gt;The Rhythm Of The Heat&lt;/em&gt;, which retains its original sinister atmosphere and trades the drum-based outro for a full on orchestral wig-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tracks disappoint though, &lt;em&gt;OVO&lt;/em&gt; is forgotten for a reason and &lt;em&gt;Digging In The Dirt&lt;/em&gt; was never the most interesting song on &lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt;: it certainly isn’t with the guitars stripped away and a rather poor version of the vocal. Meanwhile &lt;em&gt;Darkness&lt;/em&gt; is exposed as a fragmented mess (as pretty much any song off &lt;em&gt;Up&lt;/em&gt; would have been, save perhaps for &lt;em&gt;The Drop&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sky Blue&lt;/em&gt;) and made all the worse by what sounds like a poor Tom Waits impersonation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Waits&lt;/strong&gt; you say? I managed to forget about &lt;em&gt;Real Gone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest-october-2011&quot;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;. This was because I hadn’t had much time to listen to it at the time (mainly because I bought the Coldplay album and hadn’t expected to). Getting to know it a bit more, I can say that I really like it. I don’t think it is the best album that he has ever produced but it is better than &lt;em&gt;Real Gone&lt;/em&gt;, it’s shorter, more direct and for the large part sweeter. I think you could probably live without the last two tracks but that would make for a very short album indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the highlights are &lt;em&gt;Talking At The Same Time&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Back In The Crowd&lt;/em&gt; (though I originally thought it was rather morbid, having heard the chorus as “put me back in the ground”), the title track and &lt;em&gt;Satisfied&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few albums that I’d like to get hold of next month but I get the feeling that I may end up writing an overview of the year on New Year’s Eve (much like last year) and not an album digest. We’ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #14: Clear by Bomb The Bass</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-14"/>
   <updated>2011-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-14</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think it’s time to discuss your philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavour…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That quote is from the movie “The Naked Lunch” directed by David Cronenburg (see also &lt;a href=&quot;/crash/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) and it also opens “Bug Powder Dust” by Bomb The Bass, the five star single that opens “Clear”. A rollicking piece of rock rap dripping with pop culture references that runs for four and half minutes and does not stop until another quote from “The Naked Lunch”, it is probably one of my favourite songs of the 90s. That churning guitar line sends me right back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the rest of the album proceeds in more straightforward fashion. Second song “Sleepyhead” is all dub rhythms and fuzzy guitar, the sort of record I used to dream of making for myself. I used to write a lot of songs around this time and I reckon most of them sounded like “Sleepyhead” inside my head, even if it is a pretty standard bit of 90’s R&amp;amp;B made interesting by that dub baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more exciting is the second single “One To One Religion”, a great combination of a &lt;em&gt;really interesting&lt;/em&gt; bassline, meditation bells and a soft vocal that might be a bit X Factor but does the job for me. Back when I first bought the album, it was the bassline that really excited and was part of establishing my love of electronic music. On the CD single, there is also an amazing instrumental mix by Tim Simenon and one of my first encounters with 808 State in the form of the “Space Funk” mix, a track that I learned to love by at first absolutely hating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that comes “Darkheart”, which unusually is featured in its 12” version and introduces another strident bassline. It is interesting that the vocal, a pretty standard reggae song about being strong and fighting off the forces of darkness, holds up so well against the aggressive and elastic backing track. “Darkheart” was also a single (the Sabres Of Paradise mixes are excellent) and the 7” edit is a completely different song - pretty much a standard reggae tune. At first I would include that version on my walkman cassette of the album but nowadays I much prefer the more aggressive version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the novel things for me about “Clear” was the way spoken word tracks were deployed throughout. “If You Reach The Border” is the first of three (or five, if you count the samples on “Bug Powder Dust” and “Somewhere”). A disembodied female voice that sounds like an answerphone message describes gender politics (I think, or maybe drug addiction) over a crunchy background - another very dominant bassline and some nice detail in the synths in the treble range. I used to find it very spooky, it fits well as a homage to Burroughs - both in terms of the subject matter and the cut-up techniques applied to the voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that, we have “Brain-dead” or if you like “Bug Powder Dust 2”. It is more laid back than “Bug Powder Dust”, very much in keeping with the then nascent trip hop genre. There’s a wonderful slow sucking synth that underpins the chorus, it is how I imagine having your brain removed by a vacuum cleaner might sound; it would not sound out of place on Portishead’s recent masterpiece “Third”. Like “Dark Heart” it also has a wonderful false ending with yet another A+ bassline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://will-self.com/&quot;&gt;Will Self&lt;/a&gt; provides the vocal on “5ML Barrel”, a harrowing account of the impact that injecting morphine extracted from kaolin and morphine on a junkie’s circulatory system. The problem being that when siphoning off the morphine from the solution the narrator cannot help but take some chalk (kaolin) as well and this ends up being deposited along his veins. If I didn’t think drugs were bad (“Mmmkay”) before hearing this track, I definitely did afterwards. It’s horribly gruesome and something of a guilty pleasure for it. It is mostly Will Self’s excellent deadpan delivery that makes the track such awful fun but the backing is again interesting and admirable. Around this time I would have been well immersed in The Orb’s dub experiments but hearing in this (almost) rock context was a real ear-opener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Somewhere” is the only instrumental on the album (save for some de rigeur late 90s ethnic chanting and a few words in a sample at the end) and is probably more like “space funk” than that 808 State remix I mentioned earlier. It sounds a lot like The Future Sound Of London, another band that I would have been heavily into at the time. At that stage in my musical fandom I was beginning to realise that an instrumental was not necessarily a lesser track on a vocal album and “Somewhere” was likely most responsible for establishing that view point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The B-sides to singles off “Clear” that were not remixes were also instrumentals. “Dressed In Black” (again not completely instrumental, there are movie samples), which backed “Dark Heart”, is a pretty standard five minute guitar and dub bass knock off. Meanwhile, “Absorber” the B-side to “Sandcastles” was a really quite futuristic drum’n’bass track, blazing a trail about two years ahead of Roni Size. Of course, there was “Timeless” by Goldie etc etc but “Absorber” is probably the first d’n’b track that made me really sit up and take notice of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite why “Sandcastles” was one of those singles, I am not so sure. It’s a pretty bland soul song with a pleasant enough vocal but actually rather forgettable compared to the rest of the album. I think that the next song “Tidal Wave” would have made a better choice, a nice bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_rock&quot;&gt;Lovers Rock&lt;/a&gt; with a vocal from (OMFG!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnie_Driver&quot;&gt;Minnie Driver&lt;/a&gt; (I only found this out a few years ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we have “Empire”, an absoloutely batshit-crazy compilation with the poet Benjamin Zephaniah and professional basket case Sinead O’Connor. The best thing is that Zephaniah and O’Connor have obviously written their parts completely independently and one of them has in fact misheard the title of the song: Zephaniah’s is “Empire” and O’Connor’s chorus and bridge are “Vampire”. It’s so crazy that it works. It bounces along with yet another dubby bassline and a springy acoustic guitar, a highlight to close an album full of them!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Contagion: A Short Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/contagion-a-short-review"/>
   <updated>2011-11-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/contagion-a-short-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was much excitement about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/&quot;&gt;Contagion&lt;/a&gt; at work. Finally a movie that explains  as part of the plot! A bunch of us went to see it, mainly to see whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://contagionmovie.warnerbros.com/index.html&quot;&gt;a disaster movie about a global pandemic&lt;/a&gt; could hold up as entertainment and to have a bit of a giggle if it couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked three things in particular about the film. I liked the cinematography, especially the opening sequences with the index cases staggering around. I liked the soundtrack except for when it intruded a bit too much into proceedings. Finally, I liked Marion Cotillard, who seems to be in every interesting movie at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and the line “Blogging is not writing. It’s just graffiti with punctuation.” was brilliant too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, without giving too many spoilers away, it was a bit flat as a film. The scenes with the scientists and the attempts to keep things under control were good, as were the scenes where they attempted to trace the contacts of the first people infected with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem was that this alone should have provided enough material for the film to be gripping and entertaining. Instead the film includes another plot strand showing the growing social disorder but this did not develop in a sufficiently compelling way. In the time given to this aspect of the plot, they should have done a lot more with their ideas. I have a sneaking suspicion that it would make for a pretty good parallel film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think it was a brave attempt to make “The Day After Tomorrow But Most People Get A Nasty Cough And Have Fits And Some Of Them Die” (Hey, I’m not paid to think of titles for films and I think we now know why). It over-reaches in attempting to cover too many story arcs (the lovely Ms Cotillard is completely forgotten for about an hour!) but it is a noble stab at creating an informative and thought-provoking film around a subject that is both fascinating and often misunderstood in popular media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2020-update&quot;&gt;2020 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha ha ha ha. My goodness, living this movie is scarier than it makes out!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mark Rowlands, The Philosopher And The Wolf</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-philosopher-and-the-wolf"/>
   <updated>2011-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-philosopher-and-the-wolf</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw that a friend had ‘liked’ this book on Facebook and reading about it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosopher-Wolf-Lessons-Death-Happiness/dp/1847081029/&quot;&gt;amazon&lt;/a&gt;, I was curious enough to give it a go. It is the autobiography of the philosopher &lt;a href=&quot;http://rowlands.philospot.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Rowlands&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the experiences and lessons learned from raising a wolf, Brenin, from cub to maturity and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book addresses different aspects of philosophy including the nature of evil and the interaction between humans and other animals. As you might expect, the book pays particular attention to our interactions with wolves and dogs. There is also a lot of explanation of the difference between wolves and dogs. Rowlands appears often to disparage dogs, though remembering my experiences of our Labradors while growing up did make me nod in agreement quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what he has to say about his actions seem a little hagiographic, making himself look less controlled and more anarchic in retrospect than perhaps was the case. I appreciate that this is probably everything to do with making the book a more entertaining read and it it no way detracts from the strength of his arguments. Faced with writing any book about my past I would do the same (I would have to!). Perhaps there is not much hagiography after all and it is just my prickly reaction to someone living a more exciting life than mine! The book contains valuable insights into the nature of love, the role that death plays in our lives and what it means to care for and respect other living creatures. I definitely learned things from this book. Moreover, there is an entertaining story at the heart of the book: that of one man and his wolf. I particularly like the idea of the wolf attending his lectures and howling from time to time by way of critique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the important parts of the book is when the author realises very quickly that to do right by Brenin (bought on whim as a cub), he has to make sure that he is with him as much of the time as possible, that he is able to exhaust the wolf daily and that he continually engages with the wolf - lest he get bored and destroy the furniture/air conditioner/curtains again. I think this is also true of love and friendships, when you read the story as a manifesto for interacting with other creatures you can take a lot from it. Because of Rowlands’ remarkable respect for his wolf, most of his advice and ideas work well if you replace wolf with child or best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly harrowing experiences are recounted toward the end of the book as Brenin nearly succumbs to a tumour. It made me realise that love is not always romantic, sometimes we can express love by performing actions for a person or animal against their will (but in their best interest), or at great personal cost to oneself, in order to help them survive. This is something learned from experience and not from a book but Rowlands writes very eloquently about it, which is very useful for those of us fortunate to have so far been protected from such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book puts me in mind of two others, one that I have read and one that I haven’t. The first (the one I have read) is “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/sep/07/highereducation.news2&quot;&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/a&gt;” by John Gray, which concerns how unimportant humans actually are in the grand scheme of things - when Rowlands writes disparagingly of humans in TPATW, it made me think of this. The second is “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Teach-Quantum-Physics-Your/dp/1851687793/&quot;&gt;How to Teach Quantum Physics to Your Dog&lt;/a&gt;” by Chad Orzel - though one suspects after this that a wolf might make a better pupil!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month we have albums by Björk, Coldplay, M83, and Radiohead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-digest-october-2011---intro&quot;&gt;Album Digest October 2011 - Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to Wilco’s &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt; again the other day. I happened to be walking past the venue in Portsmouth where I went to see them live back in 2004 and it seemed the right fit. I really enjoyed the album after a period of not having listened to it and I found that being familiar with the songs allowed me to better appreciate the production of the album. It really is better than I had said last time when I included it in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/09/album-digest-september-2011/&quot;&gt;September Album Digest&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose that it was the danger in writing about music you have only had with you for a few weeks (or days in the case of &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason I am not sure whether to continue to writing these monthly album digest posts. I  enjoy them but I will start to add the warning that they are not definitive. I may also start leaving things a little longer before I write about. There is no real need to be bang up to date after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had a busy month so please bear in mind that I may totally change my mind about these albums in the next few weeks or months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;björk-biophilia&quot;&gt;Björk &lt;em&gt;Biophilia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that it sent me back to her old material is probably not the best advert for the new Bjork album &lt;em&gt;Biophilia&lt;/em&gt;. I get the feeling that she senses this too, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/08/features/music-nature-science&quot;&gt;hence the entire album being available as a series of apps&lt;/a&gt;. I confess that I bought these too. As a result I will now talk mostly about the merits of the apps rather than the songs. It is necessary to discuss how the listener might respond to the music differently because of the interactivity, but also to discuss how the music itself changes in order for the listener to be able to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that it was great fun to play with the apps. I particularly enjoyed the one for &lt;em&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; because it allowed you to create some rather chaotic remixes of the track based on about thirty samples from the track. Another great one was for &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt; because it attempted to teach you about music, you have to play Simple Simon with the notes that make up the organ tracks underpinning the song. Even better, it shows which notes make up particular modes - I probably liked this because the modes had loads of strange names. I found the other apps like &lt;em&gt;Crystalline&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Virus&lt;/em&gt; were less engaging because they felt more like something to play with while you listen to the song all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also interesting are the animations that go with each app, these are the song in the version you find on the CD together with an animation that describes the structure of the song. For example, in the case of &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt;, you get to see how all those organ chords fit together. What is particularly interesting is that &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt; is one of the tracks that sent me back to &lt;em&gt;Isobel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hyperballad&lt;/em&gt; after my first listens to the CD version of the album. There is a definitely a case to make for the apps either helping a listener to understand more challenging material, or more cynically, forcing the listener to engage with lesser content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biophilia&lt;/em&gt; is not a bad Björk album by any stretch. It is probably her best since &lt;em&gt;Vespertine&lt;/em&gt; and like every one of her albums since then, it is front-loaded with the best material. I think that her best songs have generally been about the intimacy of relationships (&lt;em&gt;Joga&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unravel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Come To Me&lt;/em&gt;) or personal experience and self-discovery (&lt;em&gt;Big Time Sensuality&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Alarm Call&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Anchor Song&lt;/em&gt;) or both (&lt;em&gt;Hyper-ballad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hunter&lt;/em&gt;). As a result, her more recent songs about more general things like the nature of the universe have left me a bit cold. However, when these songs feature a beautiful and effortless vocal like &lt;em&gt;Cosmogony&lt;/em&gt; or are surrounded by gorgeous instrumentation like &lt;em&gt;Virus&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;, this can usually be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;Biophilia&lt;/em&gt; will end up rewarding repeat listens much more than &lt;em&gt;Medúlla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Volta&lt;/em&gt; did. Until then, there are always the apps to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coldplay-mylo-xyloto&quot;&gt;Coldplay &lt;em&gt;Mylo Xyloto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I persist with Coldplay these days because of the Brian Eno connection but their last album &lt;em&gt;Viva La Vida, or Death And His Friends&lt;/em&gt; was a bit of a mess, one that was all the more frustrating for being crammed with good ideas but a bit of a mess. &lt;em&gt;Mylo Xyloto&lt;/em&gt;, despite the terrible title, is actually rather good and is definitely their best since &lt;em&gt;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&lt;/em&gt; and maybe their best yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to having lots of ideas, it would seem, is to use them as decoration of good pop songs and not to prop up rather dreary material, as was the case on &lt;em&gt;VLV&lt;/em&gt;. You can hear them in the jangling chimes that drape themselves all other the chorus in &lt;em&gt;Hurts Like Heaven&lt;/em&gt;, the tinny delicate reversed samples of the chorus of &lt;em&gt;Paradise&lt;/em&gt; that percolate the quiet moments on &lt;em&gt;Charlie Brown&lt;/em&gt; and the sudden impersonation of Bono on &lt;em&gt;Major Minus&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, sometimes old ideas are good too so you get driving riffs like those that underpinned &lt;em&gt;Clocks&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Viva La Vida&lt;/em&gt; and the “Whoa-oh-oh” replacements for choruses and middle eights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is some sort of concept or plot to all these songs but it is barely detectable, which is probably a good thing. At the end of day, it is a nice collection of pop songs played with good heart and embellished with some great production. Coldplay are good at writing albums that sound different from each other and yet still sound definitely like them. This means they will be with us for a while yet. I think that’s a pretty good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;m83-hurry-up-were-dreaming&quot;&gt;M83 &lt;em&gt;Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still getting to grips with this fantastic album from M83. I skipped their last album &lt;em&gt;Saturdays = Youth&lt;/em&gt; because I wasn’t all that keen on their second album &lt;em&gt;Before The Dawn Heals Us&lt;/em&gt;. I wasn’t sure I liked how their sound had moved on from their gorgeous début &lt;em&gt;Dead Cities, Red Seas and Lost Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Dead Cities…&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first albums that I bought as a PhD student, an amazing shoegaze album drenched in reverb with great tracks like &lt;em&gt;Run Into Flowers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;America&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;In Church&lt;/em&gt;. It was quite a good idea album to get spaced out to while walking home from university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming&lt;/em&gt; is a massive leap on from &lt;em&gt;Dead Cities…&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Before The Dawn…&lt;/em&gt;, for one thing there has been a move from “tracks” to “songs” and there is a real muscularity to the vocals. Whereas before the vocals would be buried under mountains of synth and reverb, now you can hear them even when there is a really dense arrangement going on behind them. It makes tracks like the opening trio of &lt;em&gt;Intro&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Midnight City&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reunion&lt;/em&gt; truly compelling. The first time I heard them, my hair stood on end for almost the entirety of their combined thirteen minutes. It really is the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere &lt;em&gt;Reconte-me une histoire&lt;/em&gt; is full of charm and childish glee (a girl tells the story of a special frog that makes magical things happen when you lick it) and &lt;em&gt;Year One, One UFO&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliantly arranged giddy knees up that you might expect from someone like Lemon Jelly, that is until the guitars really kick in like they mean it (Compare this track to the rather weedy &lt;em&gt;The Shouty Track&lt;/em&gt; off LJ’s &lt;em&gt;‘64-‘95&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The double album structure is well suited to me as each half lasts the time it takes me to walk to work, although I think CD2 is more suited to the morning and CD1 to the evening. I find that I have listened to CD2 less, perhaps because of that aforementioned strong opening but I really should be more even-handed or I am going to miss out on fantastic songs like &lt;em&gt;Steve McQueen&lt;/em&gt;, which sounds like it would fit in really nicely on the Washed Out album that I really loved earlier on in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic album, perhaps one of the best this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;radiohead-tkol-rmx-1234567&quot;&gt;Radiohead &lt;em&gt;TKOL RMX 1234567&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of remixes of tracks from The King Of Limbs, an album that is fast cementing its place as one of my favourite Radiohead albums. I think it is better than &lt;em&gt;In Rainbows&lt;/em&gt;, I love the knotted textures and dead ends. It coos and sighs and is definitely up there as one of the more upbeat and optimistic Radiohead albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that &lt;em&gt;TKOL&lt;/em&gt; is ideal material for remixing? I would have said yes but this collection is rather uneven. Personal favourites include the two mixes of &lt;em&gt;Giving Up The Ghost&lt;/em&gt;, particularly the one by Brokenchord because the sounds a bit like it is constructed from the wonderful Mike Oldfield B-side &lt;em&gt;Bones&lt;/em&gt; (even though it almost certainly is not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is good value for money in that it collates for about £8 a collection of seven vinyl only EPs that would set you back £12 each. OK, you have to make do with a CD and not seven slabs of beautiful clear vinyl but we all have to save money these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that some tracks are over represented. With 19 remixes here from a ten track album, this means there should be roughly two mixes of tracks and so that there are five mixes of &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is a little hard to take (The Blawan remix is awesome, will definitely be hunting down more of their material). Also, there are no remixes of &lt;em&gt;Supercollider&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Butcher&lt;/em&gt;, both of which would have been great source material for the remixers who have contributed here. What is quite cool though is the mega mix contributed by Altrice (Mostly &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt; (again!) and &lt;em&gt;Giving Up The Ghost&lt;/em&gt; I think…), another palpable highlight that uses most of the songs to build a new track. I will no doubt discover more on repeat listens, I find it is a good album to put on shuffle and code to.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, September 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-09-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-september-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, a rather grey looking selection of covers this month. The albums I have listened to most are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;John Beltran &lt;em&gt;Ambient Selections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FabricLive 59 mixed by Four Tet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Rapture &lt;em&gt;In The Grace Of Your Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wilco &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have actually only had the Wilco album since Monday of this week (the 26th) but it has inveigled its way into my consciousness quite quickly. As I have said before, &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/playlist-1-metallic/&quot;&gt;this blog owes its name to a Wilco song&lt;/a&gt; and they are quite an important band to me. The other albums are mostly electronic, although The Rapture are distinctly indie flavoured as they hit the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-beltran-ambient-selections&quot;&gt;John Beltran &lt;em&gt;Ambient Selections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this album entirely by chance while reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/&quot;&gt;Resident Advisor&lt;/a&gt; the other week. The idea of the album intrigued me and I think that it is well known that I do love a bit of ambient music. I was also attracted to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.delsinrecords.com/release.php?idxRelease=2417&quot;&gt;coloured triple vinyl&lt;/a&gt; at first as it did look rather pretty. (It’s sold out now, I could have had the last one!) Admittedly, I have no record player to play them on but Delsin do allow you to download MP3s to accompany any physical purchases. In the end I settled for the CD, stumping up an extra three euros for the physical manifestation and a bonus track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a really peaceful and placid CD. It is definitely something you could put on in the background and work to. If you don’t pay close attention it can wash over you and into the ether. I have no problem with this as that is what ambient music is supposed to do. The bonus is that a lot of the tracks also reward a closer listen too: &lt;em&gt;Collage of Dreams&lt;/em&gt; is actually quite bouncy and textural for ambient, &lt;em&gt;Sweet Soul&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brilliant Flood&lt;/em&gt; have a pleasing techno dimension to them, and &lt;em&gt;Guitaris Breeze&lt;/em&gt; is simply just beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one criticism is that it is a bit sterile in places. The crunchy bits a quite satisfying and so it is disappointing when it sags a little in the middle. Perhaps more worryingly these points seem to correspond with the only 2011 material on the collection. Meanwhile two tracks near the end &lt;em&gt;Vienna&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Collage Revisited&lt;/em&gt; bristle with energy and invention, it would have been nice to have heard that throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fabriclive-59-mixed-by-four-tet&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;FabricLive 59&lt;/em&gt; mixed by Four Tet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this latest instalment in the Fabric series of mixes wins the cover of the year straight off the bat. Meanwhile, I frigging love Four Tet. Last year’s &lt;em&gt;There Is Love In You&lt;/em&gt; was a fantastic album that arrived in my life just when I needed it, all smiles and beats and happiness. &lt;em&gt;Rounds&lt;/em&gt; did much the same as I was finishing my masters and starting my PhD. His first band Fridge were a major source of comfort during my undergraduate years (my copy of their album &lt;em&gt;Happiness&lt;/em&gt; arrived on September 11 2001) and his support of Radiohead in San Sebastian in 2002 was a highlight in an evening chock full of highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also eventually realised that I already had a mix collection from him, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dj-kicks.com/FourTet/&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;DJ Kicks&lt;/em&gt; compilation from 2006&lt;/a&gt;. That was a fantastic record that stayed in the kitchen CD player for months, a really interesting concoction of sounds all sounding as though they came from a parallel universe where the music was much better. That CD gave me a re-introduction to Stereolab and Autechre, while introducing me to Curtis Mayfield (who I should have known about already) and to Animal Collective (who I did not really investigate until last year). The best thing about the mix as a whole was just how fun it was, skipping from one genre to another and keeping everything moving and kinetic and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new mix five years on has these features too though because it is for Fabric it is a little more studious, a geeky effort aimed squarely at the dancefloor. This is no bad thing as it makes for a compilation with that same propulsiveness but operates within a tighter and more refined collection of genres. Not that I am saying the diversity of the &lt;em&gt;DJ Kicks&lt;/em&gt; mix was a bad thing, far from it. I just mean that it is also nice to have a more focussed collection to listen to too. Anyway, it is not as if restricting oneself to club friendly music is that much of a restriction anyway, such is the diversity in the music these days - the Fabric compilations themselves are often shining examples of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mention the Fabric CDs every month because I very rarely have the opportunity to listen to 70+ minutes of continuous music these days and when I do, a Fabric mix is often not the most appropriate choice. However, I am glad that I made the effort for this mix as it is fantastic. The time flies by and a lot of the choices are genuinely entertaining and interesting. One thing that is certain is that I shall have to get hold of a copy of &lt;em&gt;Street Halo&lt;/em&gt; by Burial at some point before the year is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rapture-in-the-grace-of-your-love&quot;&gt;The Rapture &lt;em&gt;In The Grace Of Your Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I buy a record just because of its cover. I know that you are not really supposed to do this and to be honest, I have tracks by The Rapture on various compilations and generally tend to like records released on &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfarecords.com/main/&quot;&gt;the DFA label&lt;/a&gt;, so I didn’t go in completely blind. I just loved that picture of the surfer, it’s a great fit to the subject matter of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by &lt;em&gt;In The Grace Of Your Love&lt;/em&gt; because most of the tracks that I already had were either remixes or part of mix compilations. It was refreshing to hear slightly more traditional songs from them. The album itself is a solid 6 out of 10 album with a surprisingly warm heart. I was a little surprised that there wasn’t a little more material that you might directly relate to the DFA sound, all you get here is &lt;em&gt;Can You Find A Way?&lt;/em&gt; and the single &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.junodownload.com/products/how-deep-is-your-love-remix-ep/1835956-02/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Deep Is Your Love?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; towards the end. Those two songs are excellent and are bankers for compilations, especially the latter as it can be dropped whenever you feel like going all disco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album is alright, concerned with finding a place in the world and tinged with a slight Christian evangelism (the clue is in the name of the band after all) that thankfully doesn’t suck. I would be happy to spin it from time to time although I have a feeling I may only be digging it out for those two stand out songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wilco-the-whole-love&quot;&gt;Wilco &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned up at the top of this post that Wilco must been a lot to me as a band. If you include the two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woodyguthrie.org/merchandise/mermaidavenuevol1.htm&quot;&gt;Mermaid Avenue&lt;/a&gt; albums then they were on a six (possibly seven as I still haven’t bought a copy of &lt;em&gt;A.M.&lt;/em&gt;) album hot streak between &lt;em&gt;Being There&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Ghost Is Born&lt;/em&gt;. In 2004 I saw them live in Portsmouth drawing on that material and they were really rather awesome. It seems weird that it is only seven years ago, it feels like a whole lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the largely woozy and experimental &lt;em&gt;A Ghost Is Born&lt;/em&gt; though, they kicked out a dog in the shape of &lt;em&gt;Sky Blue Sky&lt;/em&gt;. Suddenly a band that had been constantly shifting and reinventing itself had been caught in the glare and found that it wasn’t sure where to go next. The lyrics were exceptionally poor, all the experimentation was stripped back and everything was decidedly boring and samey. I don’t think I listened to it more than three times. EDIT: I went back to &lt;em&gt;Sky Blue Sky&lt;/em&gt; and it turns out I was being a bit harsh. Most of it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; rather dreary but there are at least two cracking songs on there: &lt;em&gt;You Are My Face&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Side With The Seeds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time out I think they tried to pick and mix from earlier albums and perhaps aware that most bands that far into their careers would be releasing a greatest hits they called it &lt;em&gt;Wilco (The Album)&lt;/em&gt;. It was better than &lt;em&gt;Sky Blue Sky&lt;/em&gt;, especially given that I can think of songs that I actually like. As an example, I think that &lt;em&gt;Deeper Down&lt;/em&gt; would have nestled nicely on &lt;em&gt;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;A Ghost Is Born&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trajectory continues here, there is no out-and-out invention on &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt; and a lot of the middle seems at first listen to be padded out with the &lt;em&gt;White Album&lt;/em&gt; pastiche that they mastered in &lt;em&gt;A Ghost Is Born&lt;/em&gt;’s more straight-laced moments. However, the tracks that bookend the album are exceptional. The opener &lt;em&gt;Art of Almost&lt;/em&gt; is a great buzzing concoction that isn’t hindered by the rather abstract lyrics (in the same way that &lt;em&gt;Panthers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;I Am Trying To Break Your Heart&lt;/em&gt; aren’t) and I find it to be really exciting. I am not sure whether an entire album of jams like this would be particularly spectacular but I can’t help hoping for one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, at the other end of the album and at the other end of the experimental spectrum, we have &lt;em&gt;One Sunday Morning&lt;/em&gt;. It is twelve minutes long and is actually a full song that includes a rather tender lyric between a son and a father discussing religion. It is probably one of their best lyrics since &lt;em&gt;Via Chicago&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;How To Fight Loneliness&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike previous long tracks at the end of Wilco albums, it actually fills out its full run time - unlike say &lt;em&gt;Less Than You Think&lt;/em&gt;, which closed &lt;em&gt;A Ghost…&lt;/em&gt; and included about eleven minutes of migraine-inspired white noise. There was a good reason for that at the time but it doesn’t bear repeat listens so I am glad that this song doesn’t have a similar structure. Instead it trails off into the distance with a cute little guitar figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a fitting end to an album that hopefully sets Wilco up for something more adventurous next time out. This was probably the last of their albums that I was going to buy without thinking about it but now I am genuinely curious again about where they might go next.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #13: U.F.Orb by The Orb</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-13"/>
   <updated>2011-09-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-13</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUN FACT:&lt;/strong&gt; It was because of the artwork to this album that I obsessively scrawled onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome on my pencil case at school. I also had a very passable u.f.orb logo drawn on it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-blue-room&quot;&gt;In The Blue Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my first “close encounter” with The Orb in 1992 when the single &lt;em&gt;Blue Room&lt;/em&gt; was in the charts. Back then, as I &lt;a href=&quot;uc2&quot;&gt;mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt;, I would listen to the radio a lot and this tune - introduced as the longest single ever to enter the UK chart - struck me as really interesting. The radio edit was a burbling wash of synths and female vocals underpinned by a hefty bass performance from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2008/06/wobble-life-music-dub-leaving&quot;&gt;Jah Wobble&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, the same week that &lt;em&gt;Blue Room&lt;/em&gt; entered the chart, I was actually listening out for &lt;em&gt;Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; by Mike Oldfield and this single (&lt;a href=&quot;uc10&quot;&gt;from Tubular Bells II&lt;/a&gt;) featured two remixes by The Orb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful what you wish for though, the full length version of &lt;em&gt;Blue Room&lt;/em&gt; (39:58) is a little too long to be interesting, particularly if you are paying close attention. The album version (17:34) is excellent and is probably the correct length for all its movements and such, while the live version (14:58) released on the &lt;em&gt;Live ‘93&lt;/em&gt; is probably the best recorded version that is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-of-objective-contents-of-thoughts&quot;&gt;“The World Of Objective Contents Of Thoughts…”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;Live ‘93&lt;/em&gt;, this was the first Orb album that I ended up owning. It is a sprawling two and a half hour set that includes all the best tunes from between 1989 and 1993. When I dislocated my knee on the school playground in 1994, it would be the version of &lt;em&gt;OOBE&lt;/em&gt; from this album that I would focus on to help me through that terrible pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OOBE&lt;/em&gt; has a wonderfully niggling riff that builds and repeats. Like most of The Orb’s early work, it is the spaces between the musical figures and the vocal samples that really contributes to the atmosphere of the piece. The album version is far and away the best version and I would not hear that until about a year later when I got &lt;em&gt;U.F.Orb&lt;/em&gt; for my fifteenth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other interesting versions of &lt;em&gt;OOBE&lt;/em&gt; are the session version on the second &lt;em&gt;Peel Sessions&lt;/em&gt; disc (and later the &lt;em&gt;BBC Sessions 1999-2001&lt;/em&gt; album) and the version by the late Andy Hughes that is included on the bonus disc of the remaster. Both of these version tease out the acoustic guitar melodies that are somewhat buried on the original and both take on a more fairy-tale quality as opposed to album version’s dark trip through the unknowable depths of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;babylon-and-ting&quot;&gt;Babylon and Ting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another track on the album with a large number of alternate versions is &lt;em&gt;Towers Of Dub&lt;/em&gt;, it features a gently lilting dub figure and the number of dog barks present in the mix is dependent on the version you are listening to. I gradually came to accept the album version (15:00) as canonical with its hilarious Victor Lewis-Smith intro and light smattering of woofs. Newcomers though are invited to sample the delights of the version of Live ‘93 (12:33) as it completely destroys the gentleness of the original with a cavernous beat and the barks of some sort of demented ambient Cerberus. Meanwhile the ambient mix (10:00) included on the greatest hits compilation &lt;em&gt;U.F.Off&lt;/em&gt; (see what they did there?!) is much gentler and closes out with a pretty funny comedy skit involving a car with trunk full of weed that still makes me giggle to this day. There’s also a version by Mad Professor (14:58) that drifts close to (and may well have been the inspiration for) the insanity of the live version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three tracks &lt;em&gt;OOBE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blue Room&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Towers Of Dub&lt;/em&gt; comprise over half the playing time of the album. The four remaining tracks are interesting too. The title track &lt;em&gt;U.F.Orb&lt;/em&gt; should probably have featured more in their live sets and in their remixes, there is one by Bandulu (7:46) that turns it into a trancy banger but there appear to be no other versions of the track (even on the reissue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;close-encounter-majestic-and-sticky-end&quot;&gt;Close Encounter, Majestic and Sticky End…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two long tracks on the album, &lt;em&gt;Close Encounter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Majestic&lt;/em&gt;, are also rarely reprised throughout the remainder of the discography. I think there is an alternative version of &lt;em&gt;Majestic&lt;/em&gt; on a &lt;em&gt;Trance Europe Express&lt;/em&gt; compilation somewhere but the only other mixes of these two tracks are the “ambient mix” of the former (12:50) and the supposed original cut of the latter (11:53) that appear on the reissue. &lt;em&gt;Close Encounter&lt;/em&gt; is a stormy downtempo dance track that fits the album’s mood of alien visitation, it is a collaboration with Slam. &lt;em&gt;Majestic&lt;/em&gt; refers to the persons supposedly in the know about the Roswell incident, the Majestic 12; it has a lovely sample of Mr. Spock (or someone who sounds very much like him) saying “wake up”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album ends with &lt;em&gt;Sticky End&lt;/em&gt;, a pretty Ronseal track for the end of an album about aliens. It features some slowed down analogue synths that sound like a big squelchy alien coming unstuck. Fortunately it doesn’t last too long, though I am surprised that there isn’t at least a fan-made extended remix out there. Maybe there is… look to the skies…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Frank Herbert, Dune</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/dune"/>
   <updated>2011-09-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/dune</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week or so ago, I finished reading &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; by Frank Herbert. It tells the story of a revolution within a Galactic Empire that takes place on a harsh and unforgiving desert planet called Arrakis. The central themes are how destinies can be shaped despite being intertwined around many axes, and also the importance of adaptation in the fight for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/&quot;&gt;David Lynch film&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert%27s_Dune&quot;&gt;the Sci-Fi Channel’s mini-series&lt;/a&gt;, which I was able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lovefilm.com/film/Dune-Part-1/161663/&quot;&gt;stream through LoveFilm&lt;/a&gt;. Of the two filmed versions, I found the latter to be more enjoyable and this is almost certainly because it runs to nearly six hours. The 1984 film runs to over 3 hours and yet still feels rather rushed. The Lynch version is to be praised though as in my opinion it develops a unique aesthetic for the Dune universe that I did not detect so much in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because of the first film, I was expecting to find the novel to be rather ornate and long-winded but it turned out to be a thumping good read that really kept me engrossed. The plot clips along briskly, aided by both the complexity of the plot and also the sense of pre-destination. By this I mean the feeling that you get that every happening is inevitable, something that is aided by the structural device of including excerpts from texts that  are written after the events that you read about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device of quoting supposed later authoritative sources was also used in  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=isaac+asimov&amp;hl;=en&amp;prmd;=imvnsbo&amp;tbm;=isch&amp;tbo;=u&amp;source;=univ&amp;sa;=X&amp;ei;=oBl6TqTkFMa00QXszuysAQ&amp;ved;=0CFEQsAQ&amp;biw;=1679&amp;bih;=845&amp;uss;=1&quot;&gt;Isaac Asimov&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series&quot;&gt;Foundation sequence&lt;/a&gt;. It’s probably why I loved them so much. At twelve years old I used to love reading encyclopaedias (there was no internet after all) and I longed for a copy of the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia Galactica&lt;/em&gt;, snippets of which were inserted at the start of each chapter. The Foundation sequence definitely deserves a post of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised at how little description there was of the worms, especially given that in popular culture they are pretty much the element that defines &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps it emerges from the films where they are very much a set-piece and more has to go into making them awe-inspiring and terrifying. It may also be because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000&quot;&gt;the computer game &lt;em&gt;Dune 2000&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/em&gt; style affair that introduced a generation of gamers not only to sandworms but also to resource harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure whether I will throw myself into the remainder of the Dune novels, there are certainly a whole host of them out there. Perhaps they are where a lot more of the detail used in the films is filled in. I have got myself a copy of &lt;em&gt;Dune Messiah&lt;/em&gt; but I have a few other books to finish off before I start on that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, August 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-august-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bought a collection of electronic music this month. I mixed them all up in a smart playlist on iTunes, the smart aspect being to limit to tracks that had been played fewer than five then six then seven times etc. This made sure I was still listening to all the tracks equally often, despite the randomness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biosphere &lt;em&gt;N-plants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ford &amp;amp; Lopatin &lt;em&gt;Channel Pressure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gus Gus &lt;em&gt;Arabian Horse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instra:Mental &lt;em&gt;Resolution 653&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jon Tejada &lt;em&gt;Parabolas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;biosphere-n-plants&quot;&gt;Biosphere &lt;em&gt;N-Plants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this album makes Biosphere the most reviewed musician on this blog at the moment but I don’t mind too much, he makes some great stuff. &lt;em&gt;N-Plants&lt;/em&gt; is a series of pieces about Japanese nuclear power plants and was ready for release by about February this year, just before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster&quot;&gt;Fukishima nuclear disaster&lt;/a&gt; in March. It ended up being released in June. I am not sure if this represents a delay or not but as this quote shows, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to84_biosphere_nplants.html&quot;&gt;Geir Jenssen is aware of how spooky the timing was&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a fantastic album and it is definitely a set of tunes that celebrates nuculear power rather than seeks to create anxiety about it (Unlike Kraftwerk’s downbeat revisit to &lt;em&gt;Radioactivity&lt;/em&gt; say). Each track burbles along with a wonderous sense of precision and something emerges out of the mechanical rhythms that is really rather joyous. Even from the initial hisses and creaks of &lt;em&gt;Joyo&lt;/em&gt;, a crystalline and shifting tune begins to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I was concerned that a Biosphere album not linked to natural phenomena (compared to &lt;a href=&quot;uc4&quot;&gt;Substrata&lt;/a&gt; and Cirque) might be too abstract and austere but I like it more and more with every listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ford--lopatin-channel-pressure&quot;&gt;Ford &amp;amp; Lopatin &lt;em&gt;Channel Pressure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Channel Pressure&lt;/em&gt; has been out for a while. Ford &amp;amp; Lopatin originally went under the moniker of Games but were unfortunately undermined by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/15/game-twitter-prank-la-police&quot;&gt;talentless rapping knob-bucket The Game&lt;/a&gt;. A shame because there is a nice 8-bit quality that underpins a lot of the songs on this album. It mainly features angular house music with an 80s vibe and there are plenty of songs that would fit well on the radio. Or would have done if we had experienced anything remotely like a proper summer this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, great songs like &lt;em&gt;Emergency Room&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World of Regret&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Joey Rodgers&lt;/em&gt; are missing from your life and you should probably do your level best to rectify this. The latter in particular sounds like it should come from the soundtrack to an 80s buddy cop movie and I mean that as high praise. It’s not just the lovely camp vocal but also the genius guitar solo in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere the album is full of little instrumentals and tracks like &lt;em&gt;Rock Center Paranoia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dead Jammer&lt;/em&gt;. The former sounds a bit like Giorgio Moroder crossed with Boards of Canada and the latter is not far off that either. These little flourishes and diversions work well both within and between the songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to admire here and it bears up well to repeat listens. I will be going back to it many times for upcoming walks to and from work, particularly when the sunshine comes back. Meanwhile, can anyone tell me what the heck the song sampled on &lt;em&gt;Break Inside&lt;/em&gt; is? Or is it a cover? It seems really familiar. The problem with digital downloads is that often you don’t get a booklet to pore through to see who wrote and performed what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gus-gus-arabian-horse&quot;&gt;Gus Gus &lt;em&gt;Arabian Horse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also released a while ago was &lt;em&gt;Arabian Horse&lt;/em&gt;, the new album by everyone’s fourth favourite Icelandic band Gus Gus (after Bjork, Sigur Ros and The Sugarcubes right?). I was amazed when I read on their wikipedia page just how long they had been releasing albums, even though I do remember having a copy of &lt;em&gt;Polydistortion&lt;/em&gt; way back in 1999 and it is probably just my fault for forgetting just how fast time has been passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the music. The best tracks for me are the opener &lt;em&gt;Selfoss&lt;/em&gt;, the title track and &lt;em&gt;When Your Lover’s Gone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selfoss&lt;/em&gt; emerges out of the silence at the start of the album with a subdued but strident beat, it is reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Dubnobass…&lt;/em&gt;-era Underworld. Gradually as tetchy fragmented electronics shimmer over the surface it breaks into life around the three minute mark with a trancey break that Tiesto would be proud of. Best of all, it collapses in on itself at the end with a laconic accordian sample. From trance to Tom Waits in ninety seconds, marvellous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arabian Horse&lt;/em&gt; the song is a bit more straightforward. It begins with a thumping beat and a nice synth sound that could have originated with a recording of a wasp in a bottle. By about a minute in, we have settled into a nice vocal and a house beat. The female chorus line of “More and more sand in my eye / Too bright to even see the sun” is one I have caught myself singing along to quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other obvious single is “When Your Lover’s Gone”, which has a vocal that sounds very similar to something that Anthony and the Johnsons might produce (I’m thinking of his collaboration with Bjork on “Volta”). Underneath the vocal another interesting beat and synth combination bounces along. I think that is what I like so much about the album as a whole, the details that appear from under the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instramental-resolution-653&quot;&gt;Instra:Mental &lt;em&gt;Resolution 653&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;em&gt;Resolution 653&lt;/em&gt; by Instra:mental, which I think was released back in May. I am still not sure what to make of this record. I think I admire it but I don’t really like it that much. Take the opening track &lt;em&gt;Sun Rec&lt;/em&gt; as an example, it begins with a rather unfriendly sequence built out of some nasty synth sounds but then it loses its nerve about half way through and pads things out with some synth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the album reminds me of LFO, who were fantastic at melding interesting sounds to some pretty frenetic beats at times. This means that there are definitely some gems here. &lt;em&gt;User&lt;/em&gt; would be a great track without the vocal sample but is just annoying with it present. &lt;em&gt;Waterfalls&lt;/em&gt; and Arc get the mix of menace and subtlety dead right though. Meanwhile &lt;em&gt;Aggro Acid&lt;/em&gt; would give Aphex Twin a run for his money despite not quite having the deranged charm that makes Aphex’s records such a delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed dBridge and Instra:mental’s FabricLive mix, which was a little more mellow than this album. Perhaps if I live with it a little longer I will find a bit more to like as well as admire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jon-tejada-parabolas&quot;&gt;Jon Tejada &lt;em&gt;Parabolas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Tejada is another artist I have been introduced to by the fabric series. I also really liked his remix of Bomb The Bass’s &lt;em&gt;X-Ray Eyes&lt;/em&gt; last year. That and the fact that his new album has been released on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kompakt.fm/&quot;&gt;Kompakt label&lt;/a&gt; led me to shelling out for his CD. For the most part, it’s money well spent. Of all the albums above &lt;em&gt;Parabolas&lt;/em&gt; is most like the Biosphere album, it is quite mellow and abstract - yet it is also pretty humane and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is harder to pick out individual tracks for discussion from this album than any of the others previously mentioned. Perhaps the title is a clue, because the album is called &lt;em&gt;Parabolas&lt;/em&gt; are we meant to discern some general pattern from the examples presented here? It is certainly the case that the tracks here ebb and flow without changing dramatically, though this is not meant to damn with faint praise (“he’s saying they all sound the same”) rather to exhibit the possibility that exploring variations of themes is sometimes interesting. It certainly works well as a whole and it also dovetails nicely with other tracks from this month’s albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have listened to most of these five albums &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt; from a shuffled smart playlist in iTunes and it has been a good listen. The albums are sufficiently similar to cohere well together as a playlist and yet sufficiently different that it doesn’t feel like I’ve just been playing a five hour Jon Tejada album.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #12: Look Sharp! by Roxette</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-12"/>
   <updated>2011-08-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-12</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;happy-birthday&quot;&gt;Happy Birthday!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how intellectual one gets about these things, the primary function of music is to have fun. With this in mind it is a good time to turn to Roxette then, as they are almost always the epitome of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received &lt;em&gt;Look Sharp!&lt;/em&gt; as a present for my ninth birthday. This was probably a bit young to fully understand all the emotions expressed on the record. It’s just as well that it is also crammed with the kind of pop confections that made &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Bore_Us,_Get_to_the_Chorus!&quot;&gt;“Don’t bore us, get to the chorus!”&lt;/a&gt; something of a band motto and made for a great introduction to the world of pop for a nine year old boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_Gessle&quot;&gt;Per Gessle&lt;/a&gt;’s vocal on &lt;em&gt;The Look&lt;/em&gt; coming as something of a shock. I’d very much fallen in love with (or developed a boyish crush on) &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Fredriksson&quot;&gt;Marie Fredriksson&lt;/a&gt;’s voice on the singles that I’d heard on my radio. I should imagine that I was probably just one of thousands of young boys all over the world. However, despite the fact that she had bought some dude with funny hair along to the party (see all eighties movies where young boy falls awkwardly in love with hot older girl) I was soon loving &lt;em&gt;The Look&lt;/em&gt; just as much as the other songs. As it turned out, I fell to my addiction to a “na na na na” chorus at the very first hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;em&gt;Dressed For Success&lt;/em&gt;, an absurdly good pop song that perhaps sounds a little more naff now than it did at the time. It doesn’t change the fact that it still makes me really happy when I listened to it. I think it meshed with those first furtive flicks through the lingerie section of the Kay’s catalogue, especially when you take the song literally. Of course only a nine year old would think that it is actually about getting dressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Single&lt;/em&gt;, a song that I think is rather undervalued in the Roxette catalogue. It is really catchy and is yet another song that makes more sense now than it did back then. The meaning of lines like “the midnight chills I get feel so rough / when the bed is big enough for both of us” began to make more sense on repeat listens as a teenager (and perhaps after listening to the &lt;em&gt;Joyride&lt;/em&gt; album, which is a little more upfront than its predecessor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-magic-formula&quot;&gt;The magic formula…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about &lt;em&gt;Look Sharp!&lt;/em&gt; is that even on songs that are quite sad (like &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Single&lt;/em&gt;) the arrangements often prevent the songs from becoming overly soppy and saccharine. Again &lt;em&gt;Joyride&lt;/em&gt; is more direct in these matters, on that album the sad songs are sad, the bouncy songs bounce and so on. &lt;em&gt;Look Sharp!&lt;/em&gt; is accused by some reviewers of containing a fair bit of filler but I disagree, I would say that perhaps the jauntiness around some of the songs disguises their true meaning and intent, and perhaps that does not sit so well with some reviewers’ ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, as on &lt;em&gt;Dance Away&lt;/em&gt;, darker emotions are brushed away by welding the lyric (a bitter yarn about waltzing away from a bad relationship) to a bouncy synth riff. Elsewhere, &lt;em&gt;A View From A Hill&lt;/em&gt; might have been more satisfying were it not for the saxes and trumpets parping all over it. It has quite an arty lyric and maybe a lack of confidence in it led to an unusual arrangement to detract from this. It is  perhaps the one out-and-out mis-step on &lt;em&gt;Look Sharp!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All over the record killer choruses abound and even if it mostly feels disposable and lightweight, it is a really fun fifty minutes. To conclude, I have to mention two crucial songs from this album. One you may already know, the single &lt;em&gt;Listen To Your Heart&lt;/em&gt; was a hit all over Europe. It closes the album. The other song is &lt;em&gt;Chances&lt;/em&gt; (which I think was released as a single in Sweden but not anywhere else), which opened the second side of my cassette version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-killer-choruses-to-deeper-things&quot;&gt;From killer choruses to deeper things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the most memorable songs that I heard as a child were the ones that woke me up to the reality of an adult world that lies beyond childhood. I have touched upon this before with &lt;a href=&quot;uc3&quot;&gt;Red Box&lt;/a&gt; and these are another two such songs. We are not just talking about sex and love here as being things that you don’t know much about when you are kid but also other things. Like for instance who you would turn to if the people around you whom you loved were no longer there or how to take your own place in the world when that day comes and you have to do things for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to it now, &lt;em&gt;Chances&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps just a standard pop song that tells its story well by pushing certain buttons: “No hunk will usurp you / No monsters will hurt you / Do you any harm” (Five points for using “usurp” in your second language Mr Gessle!). The whole theme of romance being linked to protecting someone from dark forces has stayed with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Listen To Your Heart&lt;/em&gt; is a little more sophisticated and, in my view, belongs to the pantheon of great pop singles. I think even compatriots ABBA would have struggled to write something with this song’s noble call to consider all sides when making the difficult decision of whether to leave or stay (they were too busy divorcing each other). Like the best love songs though, it transcends being about love and could represent any difficult decision or time. That’s an important thing, whether you are nine, twenty nine or ninety nine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five lessons from a year of blogging</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/five-lessons-from-a-year-of-blogging"/>
   <updated>2011-08-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/five-lessons-from-a-year-of-blogging</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have now been writing decent length articles on this site for about a year. I have learned a lot in this time, mostly about writing but also how to express your feelings and how to marshal your ideas and passions into action. For this month’s “five on the fifth”, I would like to share  with you some of the things I have learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing posts consistently is hard…&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of things that get in the way of regular posting. Sometimes it is ambition undermines me, I have ideas for posts that are easy to think up that turn out to be much harder to actually write. Other times life does just get in the way, it is  a time-consuming activity to write five hundred or more words every day. I like to write posts out longhand before typing them up. I often find mistakes or horrible phrasing when I do this and often what seemed like a simple matter of typing something up becomes a bit of a mission. Of course, there are times when I am just lazy or uninspired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…except when it is easy.&lt;/strong&gt; I discovered early on that having a few arcs through the posts was a good idea as it makes you think a few in advance about what to do next. I prefer to be a generalist but it is nice to have the movie reviews, the &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;j-g-ballard&quot;&gt;JG Ballard&lt;/a&gt; novels to fall back on. Truth be told I am a little bored of Ballard now but even if I retire that particular strand of posts (Spoiler: Don’t worry, &lt;em&gt;High-Rise&lt;/em&gt; is on the way soon) I can always resume it later. Meanwhile, I can pad out the off days with some quotes or some photos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier to read is easier to write.&lt;/strong&gt; I hope that the blog is easier to read now than when I started. I still find myself producing the odd clunky phrase now and then but the number of passive sentences is decreasing. The unexpected benefit of this has been that I find it easier to check earlier posts in search for inspiration about what to write next. Early on, I would often end up editing old posts into something more comprehensible instead of writing new material. The “After the Deadline” feature of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/&quot;&gt;Jetpack for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; has been very helpful in training me to write better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress is a lot of fun.&lt;/strong&gt; The statistic is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; now powers about 500 million websites. It is not hard to see why, it is easy to install, easy to customise to suit to your tastes and most of all, it rewards you for continuing to produce content. I have installed all sorts of plug-ins, including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-word-count/&quot;&gt;word count plug-in&lt;/a&gt; that tells me that I have (up to this post) written a total of 89,032 published words. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_a_novel&quot;&gt;If Wikipedia is to be believed&lt;/a&gt;, that is about the length of a pretty long novel. At least now I know I could write a novel in a year even if it was a rather surreal one featuring a 10K run, spiders and an Apatosaurus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I still have a lot more to do, a lot more to learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2017-update&quot;&gt;2017 Update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to this footnote some years later (2017) I realise that not all blog posts are permanent. Sometimes you write what you need to at the time and then take it down later. We don’t have to be permanently changed by what we once wrote on a Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, July 2011</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quite a mixed bag this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SBTRKT &lt;em&gt;SBTRKT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zomby &lt;em&gt;Dedication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Drums Between The Bells&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bon Iver &lt;em&gt;Bon Iver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Washed Out &lt;em&gt;Within and Without&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month’s collection of albums is a rather mellow bunch. The SBTRKT album (self-titled) is probably the most frenetic of the five though even that does not exactly pound four to the floor. Most of it is pretty calm, though  the occasional burst of pop to spice things up: sometimes it is as downtempo as the rest (&lt;em&gt;Right Thing To Do&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Trials Of The Past&lt;/em&gt;) but at other times things spark into life, as on &lt;em&gt;Pharaohs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard the album, it reminded me a lot of something like &lt;em&gt;ex:el&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/808_State&quot;&gt;808 State&lt;/a&gt; where you had abstract chin-stroking techno instrumentals rubbing shoulders with poppy tracks like &lt;em&gt;Ooops&lt;/em&gt; (featuring Bjork in her “singer from The Sugarcubes” form) and &lt;em&gt;Lift&lt;/em&gt;. Here I would say that SBTRKT does better on the pop stuff better than 808 State and the wobbly instrumental stuff a bit worse. After my first listen I tweeted (in that way that we old hands tend to) that the whole thing was just a retread of those pioneering dance music albums of the early 1990s. Of course this is not really the case and &lt;em&gt;SBTRKT&lt;/em&gt; is a pretty solid electronic album with plenty to love if you like a bit of pop thrown in your beats. If you do like your albums along those lines, &lt;em&gt;Don Solaris&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.808state.com/discogs/808pages/albpages/albgorgeousdeluxe/albgorgeousdeluxe.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 808 State are albums that may interest you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other album that I have listened to from the dubstep side of the tracks this month is &lt;em&gt;Dedication&lt;/em&gt; by Zomby. It is a 37 minute album that has genuinely shocked me with just how good it is. As the best of a pretty good bunch, it is my favourite of the albums I am writing about this month. Because in all reviews of albums from emerging genres we have to include a line like “it’s like the (insert name of universally acknowledged classic album from established genre) of (insert of seemingly churlish choice of new genre)”, I am going to say that &lt;em&gt;Dedication&lt;/em&gt; is like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Flag&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pink Flag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of dubstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you don’t know, &lt;em&gt;Pink Flag&lt;/em&gt; by Wire, released in 1977, is one of the seminal albums of punk. It is one of the albums that legitimised the genre intellectually, in other words it was a bit of a clever clogs. Specifically, &lt;em&gt;Pink Flag&lt;/em&gt; stands out for featuring 21 mostly very short tracks - over half are less than 90 seconds long. Some of the songs are this short because they are pretty much perfect that way (&lt;em&gt;Straight Line&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Three Girl Rhumba&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fragile&lt;/em&gt; to name but three) and others because leaving them in an abstract and unfinished state makes them a more interesting proposition (&lt;em&gt;106 Beats That&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Surgeon’s Girl&lt;/em&gt;). Elsewhere, the longer and more fully formed tracks like &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Strange&lt;/em&gt; are already beginning to push well toward and beyond the boundaries of what we now think of as punk. It no surprise then that we remember Wire as much for their post-punk work as for &lt;em&gt;Pink Flag&lt;/em&gt;. I think that many of these features of &lt;em&gt;Dedication&lt;/em&gt; as an album mirror those of &lt;em&gt;Pink Flag&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedication&lt;/em&gt; also has a very spare structure, 16 tracks clocking in at just under 36 minutes with most tracks under 140 seconds. It is suggestive of a set of sketches or blueprints for something that might come later. There are some more fully formed tracks that are captivating: such as, &lt;em&gt;Natalia’s Song&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Digital Rain&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t know enough about dubstep (that is probably obvious) to say what these tracks and sketches represent in terms of the whole genre, all I can say is that I found it to be a really worthwhile listen and something that I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I was going to. I should also note that I’d forgotten that &lt;em&gt;Things Fall Apart&lt;/em&gt; is actually the most frenetic thing on these five albums so scratch everything I said in the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I move on to the more singer-songwriter sort of albums of this month’s digest, I have an album to write about that works well as an intermediary: &lt;em&gt;Drums Between The Bells&lt;/em&gt; by Brian Eno. It is a spoken word album based on the poetry of Rick Holland with Eno providing the arrangements and musical backing. Eno’s last album &lt;em&gt;Small Craft On A Milk Sea&lt;/em&gt; was one of my favourites of 2010 (fun fact, it is apparently a rejected soundtrack to Peter Jackson’s &lt;em&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/em&gt;) and musically &lt;em&gt;Drums…&lt;/em&gt; is similar but for the spoken interventions, which don’t have a 100% success rate. Where it works, the effect is sublime: &lt;em&gt;Pour It Out&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Seedpods&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Airman&lt;/em&gt; are among some brilliant tracks but elsewhere there are points where either the poetry runs out of ideas (&lt;em&gt;The Real&lt;/em&gt; for example) or the music doesn’t quite provide the structure that the words require (such as on &lt;em&gt;Glitch&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sounds Alien&lt;/em&gt;). There is also an attempt to make the words more song-like: this is on &lt;em&gt;Breath of Crows&lt;/em&gt;, which is tucked away at the end. Initially I thought it was a pretty terrible mis-step but I am beginning to warm to it after a few more listens. It doesn’t help that it follows a fifty-second track of silence called… erm… &lt;em&gt;Silence&lt;/em&gt;. Seriously, who still does that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onwards then to albums of songs rather than tracks. Sweet vocals and lush arrangements are features of both the Bon Iver (self titled) and Washed Out (Within and Without) albums. The arrangements are acoustic on the former album and largely more electric on the latter. Perhaps it because most of the rest of this month’s albums have been more electronic but I got more out of the Washed Out album than from the Bon Iver one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly appreciate &lt;em&gt;Bon Iver&lt;/em&gt; and I can understand why a lot of people like it. I am beginning to too and I know enough examples of albums that are ‘growers’ to believe that I could eventually be quite evangelical about this album. It is probably a matter of mood as much as anything, a lot of it is quite downbeat and I think it is quite hard to listen to those sorts of lyrics while you aren’t really in the mood for it. On the first few listens I found it to be rather grey and mumbled but it is slowly revealing more depth, colour and shade. The first pinpricks of light came with &lt;em&gt;Holocene&lt;/em&gt; and its little line of “I could see for miles… miles… miles…” that drops off the end of the chorus. I also really like &lt;em&gt;Minnesota, WI&lt;/em&gt; with its strident drums that settle into a funky rhythm (complete with trumpets!)  and its high-pitched chorus of “Never gonna break / Never gonna break”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also took me a little while to warm to &lt;em&gt;Within And Without&lt;/em&gt; too. I am not the greatest fan of shoegaze-y stuff and that is how it sounded to me on the first listen. Initially the muted vocal and the synth washes seemed to just pass me by but as I got more familiar with the songs and their structure, I began to appreciate the builds within the tracks, not to mention a number of cute intricate details. These include the string lines weaving through the end of &lt;em&gt;Far Away&lt;/em&gt;, the processed backing vocals on &lt;em&gt;Before&lt;/em&gt; and the duet with Caroline Polachek on &lt;em&gt;You &amp;amp; I&lt;/em&gt;. Though not immediate, &lt;em&gt;WIthin and Without&lt;/em&gt; is  a fine collection of songs that would just as comfortably soundtrack a party as it would a quiet night in, not to mention the walk to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at what is up for release in August, next month’s entry might be a short one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The News</title>

   <updated>2011-07-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-news</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I read the news today, oh boy”  (The Beatles, &lt;em&gt;A Day In The Life&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes watching the news feels like a series of repeated blows to the face: arbitrary, cruel and unrelenting. It gets draining and upsetting, and leaves you fearful of what might come next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t need me to tell you about the tragedies that have occurred all over the world in the last few days: drought in East Africa, the gunman running amok in Norway, the death of Amy Winehouse and the horrific train crash in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, social networks have bought us together in ways that allow us to respond to events much more quickly. We are now able to share our reactions in pretty much real-time. Mostly this manifests in a public display of grief or shock but counterproductive and darker elements begin to creep in too. With the famine in Africa came the accusation that the continued revelations in the phone hacking scandal were burying the story. This happened particularly in News International’s remaining papers and especially in a throughly revolting cartoon in The Times. (What the hell has happened to The Times? Ten years ago I remember it being a decent paper, now it really is just The Sun with a posher font.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Norway story, we got all the knee-jerk reactions that come with any act of terrorism these days: the links to Islamists and to previous terror attacks like 9/11 and 7/7. The Sun again hit hard in its editorial, striking forceful blows that later emerged to be entirely without foundation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabloid-watch.blogspot.com/2011/07/suns-editorials-on-norway.html&quot;&gt;There is an excellent blog post here about how The Sun had to retract pretty much the entirety of Saturday’s editorial once the facts had emerged.&lt;/a&gt; It is, of course, no surprise to see The Sun stir up such a load of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Amy Winehouse, the problem was more the instant appearance of sick jokes. These made fun of a woman who had just died and were circulating within hours of her death (perhaps sooner, I was out at the time of the announcement). Elsewhere, there was clucking tone and complaints that feeling sympathy for the death of a talented artist following a prolonged period of personal difficulty was somehow invalid after the Norway tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These comments and distasteful jokes may often simply be trolling or attention seeking. Sometimes they are the work of an imbecile who claims that they are attacking political correctness. The trouble is that there really is no such thing as political correctness, just the decision to treat other human beings with the same dignity and respect that one would expect for oneself. Irrespective of gender, race, sexual orientation or history of drug addiction (among other things), no human being deserves to have their untimely death mocked or belittled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the young people who were the victims in Norway had all been drug addicts undergoing treatment, would we be less horrified by their deaths? Would we make moralistic pronouncements that if they hadn’t done drugs in the first place it never would have happened? I don’t think we would. Mind you, I am still bracing myself for an ‘opinion’ piece from one of the Mail’s dog whistling talking heads on Monday morning saying something monstrous about how being involved with socialism is what got those young Norwegians shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other fundamental misconception at work is that there is some sort of algebra of misery and suffering that can allow us to order and sift through these tragic events, allow us to declare one more important than the other and assess the worth of expressing our incomprehension and our sympathy. These beliefs work from the assumption that our reserves of sympathy are somehow finite and need to be managed, that they should only be used for the correct situations. This is of course nonsense: you can feel as shitty about any of the events of recent days as you like. It is your choice and yours alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have found myself soul-searching about whether it is necessary to be as engaged with the world as to keep up with all these things that are going on. The phone hacking scandal has produced day after day of surreal political discourse and has made me feel like everything has spun out of control. Then there was this weekend. But no. The head in the sand approach doesn’t save you from anything or protect you from anything. Ignorance and fear produce more of the world’s problems than ever before, as has the ability to look the other way. It is only by confronting head on the issues that these tragedies raise - and by engaging one another about our hopes, fears, difficulties and aspirations - that we can hope to make the world into a place where such things never happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #11: Second Toughest In The Infants by Underworld</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-11"/>
   <updated>2011-07-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-11</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-rails-your-fins-your-thin-paper-wings&quot;&gt;Your rails, your fins, your thin paper wings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Toughest in the Infants&lt;/em&gt; (STITI) is the second album by Underworld, released in 1995. This was just ahead of the mania caused by the .NUXX version of Born Slippy appearing on the &lt;em&gt;Trainspotting&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack a little later. &lt;em&gt;Born Slippy&lt;/em&gt; itself, the blippy techno confection released between their début &lt;em&gt;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&lt;/em&gt; and this album. STITI then is very much the calm before the storm and features a band (in the truest sense, which is unusual among electronic acts) in full flow. The sure hands are apparent from the off with the all-in-one trifecta of &lt;em&gt;Juanita&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kiteless&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To Dream of Love&lt;/em&gt;: a huge slab of a track that propels, mashes and then glides over various tempos in its sixteen minute run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juanita&lt;/em&gt; is the vocal piece with an epitome of Karl Hyde’s disconnected cut-up lyrics somehow teasing something meaningful out of a mish mash of found phrases: “your rails, your fins, you thin paper wings / in the wind, dangling” - it’s all in the delivery. Meanwhile, some guitar riffs almost right off &lt;em&gt;Dirty Epic&lt;/em&gt; add light and shade. &lt;em&gt;Kiteless&lt;/em&gt; arrives about six minutes, the track performing an abrupt change in gear to something more rhythmic. The guitars come back after a bit and give everything a bit of unity before it goes beat berserk at about eight minutes. Underworld are strange that even at this beat driven peak of &lt;em&gt;Kiteless&lt;/em&gt; there is still a connection back to the vocals and the guitars - this is what I meant about a true band performance, each of the elements complement each other even when one of them is foregrounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Dream of Love&lt;/em&gt; then arrives as the track collapses into piano trills and the beats begin to fade down. The vocals come back with a more elegiac tone “A bird is singing on the other side of this glass” and “listening to the barbed wire hanging”. The beats build back and then recede again, a processed voice begins to recite colours one after the other. “And red / and grey / and red / and green…”, as these voices layer over one another and echo each other the track fades away. It’s strange and emotional and quite quite brilliant. One of my favourite long tracks of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-think-i-found-the-real-stuff&quot;&gt;I think I found the real stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album then lurches into another long track consisting of parts mixed together, just two this time: the drum’n’bass tinged “Banstyle” (does anyone have the Alex Reece mix of this? I need it!) and the slow burning “Sappy’s Curry”. Amalgamated they run to fifteen minutes and as with the opening three tracks, these two evolve and develop in fascinating ways over their run time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;Banstyle&lt;/em&gt; was the first track that really brought it home to me that drum’n’bass could be &lt;em&gt;mellow&lt;/em&gt;. In a way it is not really drum’n’bass at all, by about four minutes in the synth pads are totally dominating the track’s construction and the beats are merely skittering away in the background. The lyrics are again impressionistic but mention “walking up the aisle” and “something underneath your skin”, it always makes me think of staring out the window on a rainy summer’s day and I have certainly been doing enough of that lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About six minutes in a bass guitar emerges as those skittering beats fade away, the riff builds and twists as slow-paced beats begin to each around the mix. This is the point where the track becomes &lt;em&gt;Sappy’s Curry&lt;/em&gt;: the name comes from a greyhound, just like &lt;em&gt;Born Slippy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl’s Girl&lt;/em&gt;. At this point the track has transitioned from d’n’b into something that we would have called electronic music back then but what we might call rock music now that Radiohead have paved the way for beats and textures to become part of that genre. Whatever it is, it is a beautiful track and like &lt;em&gt;Banstyle&lt;/em&gt; it is elegiac and mysterious. I really love the lyrics to this one even though they don’t make much sense as a whole, individual snatched phrases make complete sense like when you spot a perfect shape in a passing cloud. My favourite is “White car / Blue Mercedes / Happy Shopper / Bouncing Ball”. Somehow, the music manages to completely complement the lyrics, it too being a patchwork of rhythms and fragments: viz the wonderful oscillations and synths at around fourteen minutes - it all swirls, rises and falls. Really beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, just three tracks and thirty-two minutes into the album is &lt;em&gt;Confusion the Waitress&lt;/em&gt;, which is probably my favourite Underworld track ever. It has a really strident beat and this little riff that repeats over the top. The lyrics make a little more sense, they are ostensibly about the titular waitress quoted in a list of lines beginning “She said…”: “She said “loophole how are you? once again the superstar” / She said “He loves you but can you name me his children?”…”. Meanwhile the backing is all space, shadows and echoes that are cast over the mysterious lyrics. The story told seems to involve sex, lust and crime, but who knows? That’s the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Confusion…&lt;/em&gt; burbles down to a close, an instrumental called &lt;em&gt;Rowla&lt;/em&gt; hums to life and quickly moves into gear, evolving over its six and half minutes into a track that is similar in construction to the &lt;em&gt;Kiteless&lt;/em&gt; section of the opening movement. There is also a B-side called &lt;em&gt;Cherry Pie&lt;/em&gt; that is similar (it’s slower I think). &lt;em&gt;Rowla&lt;/em&gt; really gets going about two minutes in with a sawtooth synth buzzing around and dominating the beats, there are some really nice effects that build up at the peripheral of the mix and makes for a really good listen on headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-are-waiting-for-a-bus&quot;&gt;You are waiting for a bus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;em&gt;Pearl’s Girl&lt;/em&gt;, which was the single and is not dissimilar from &lt;em&gt;Born Slippy.NUXX&lt;/em&gt;: it has the frenetic beats and the megaphone vocal. What it lacks though is a refrain as wonderous and appealing as “Shouting lager lager lager”, preferring to waffle on about “Old man Einstein on top of his housewife” instead. It is a very nice track that builds nicely over its nine and a half minutes and the middle four and a half work well as a single. Talking of the single, there is an absolutely blistering remix by the band subtitled &lt;em&gt;Carp dreams (koi)…&lt;/em&gt; that pushes out the run time by another minute and completely deconstructs the track into its component parts, dispensing with most of the vocal and that looming apocalyptic two minutes of intro. It is a wonderful track that needs to be hunted down if you like the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Pearl’s Girl&lt;/em&gt; drifts down to earth on majestic synth pads and some more spidery drum and bass beats, &lt;em&gt;Air Towel&lt;/em&gt; bounces into view: a track that is perhaps the other candidate for being a single. It has perhaps the most upbeat and danceable beat of the entire album, it is like prozac in happy plastic dayglo beat driven form. There are lyrics too that emerge after about two and half-minute to add a bit of sinister shade. Once again they are impressionistic non-sequiturs, including the “happy shopper bouncing ball” line once more. It is probably the best song to feature the line “You are waiting for a bus”. After that comes a little instrumental &lt;em&gt;Blueski&lt;/em&gt; that is just under three minutes long. Some of the songs on STITI have introductions that are longer than this entire track and that is how it feels, like the introduction for a track that does not come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-naming-of-killer-boy&quot;&gt;The naming of killer boy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What arrives instead is &lt;em&gt;Stagger&lt;/em&gt;, a wonderful and sinister close to the album. It is the clearest and most performed “song” on the whole album. Like &lt;em&gt;Sappy’s Curry&lt;/em&gt; and the opening section of &lt;em&gt;To Dream of Love&lt;/em&gt;, the music behind is a subtle casting of shadows that echo the dark spaces within the lyrics. As throughout, there is a perfect match of the vocal performance with the soundscape around it: that of a strange, grey and broken London in which strange shadows move expressing love and sadness in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Toughest In The Infants&lt;/em&gt; is a masterpiece that builds and climbs and reveals itself slowly over multiple listens. It is probably one of the most important electronic albums of the nineties. While it belongs to the same time period as &lt;em&gt;Born Slippy&lt;/em&gt; and some of the tricks employed here would be revisited in a slicker fashion on the next album &lt;em&gt;Beaucoup Fish&lt;/em&gt; (viz &lt;em&gt;Cups&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jumbo&lt;/em&gt;), it remains a unique and vital part of their back catalogue. I cannot recommend it highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading a few articles about the recent launch of Google+, a few things hit home. Google tends to launch a product that works and not always one that is perfect or finished (like, say, Apple). Sometimes it takes them several iterations to get right. They love the beta tag. In fact, I think it was Google (or possibly Flickr) that made me aware of the concept of beta software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along these line I thought about this blog and its one year anniversary&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I take a similar approach here to posts on this blog, specifically in pushing out new categories now and then. I have done this in the hope that adding a new subject or thread will lead to me writing more posts. Currently I am averaging ten posts a month, which is not too bad&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this approach was successful: in twelve months I have written &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;eleven understated classics posts&lt;/a&gt; (the eleventh is coming in the next few days) and I have managed to post &lt;a href=&quot;album-digest&quot;&gt;six consecutive album digests&lt;/a&gt;. With other ideas, I have had less success: there are only two programming posts so far and none of those feature any working code and the maths posts are still a bit thin on the ground. I hope to keep up the good work and use that to give me the confidence to start working on the less successful areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be new topics too. I have friends who are foodies while I am a complete novice/ignoramus on the subject. I would really like to try to write about expanding my culinary horizons, be it cooking new recipes or visiting restaurants that I would not normally try. On other matters, I received my copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manning.com/pearson/&quot;&gt;“Generative Art”&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenbullets.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Matt Pearson&lt;/a&gt; today&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I am very excited about playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://processing.org/&quot;&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;. It is a Java based programming language for generating generative graphics like those seen in the hero image above. Some of the images in the book appear to be very natural and I want to produce some biologically inspired images to put on top of my upcoming mathematical biology posts. I should also say that I am enjoying the book a lot and I will try to write a review of it in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, returning to my theme I think that this same approach applies to life in general. If you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do it you probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;, stealing stuff and making people cry notwithstanding. I shudder to think of how many times I have sat back and let things flow around me. I think in the past year (and probably for longer) I have learned to be more proactive and engaged. You can never really be ready to live, you just have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The first post dates back to August 2010 but the about page is (was) dated July 17th 2010. If it wasn’t created automatically when I installed WordPress, I am sure I must have set up that page on the day of the install. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Admittedly, not all the posts are particularly long and full of content but I try to produce decent long form content when I can. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I linked to one of Matt’s blogs before &lt;a href=&quot;why-i-love-betty-blue&quot;&gt;when I wrote about Betty Blue&lt;/a&gt;. Small world, eh? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I Love The Jungle Book</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/why-i-love-the-jungle-book"/>
   <updated>2011-07-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/why-i-love-the-jungle-book</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just as with the &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; I want to set out my stall early on that good movies are good enough. Both &lt;a href=&quot;why-i-love-betty-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and today’s choice &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; are never going to win any sort of consensus prize for the best movies ever made but they are really good. They also have a personal history attached that makes them worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger both my sisters would be given VHS copies of Disney movies at a rate of about two a year, one for Christmas and one at their birthday. It seems strange today to think of that pace of movie acquisition, never mind the clunky VHS cassettes and how they would warp over time. I didn’t really ever get any of the Disney movies myself but I would inevitably find myself watching them with my sisters who would watch them repeatedly. With just four TV channels back then, who could blame us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess we are talking about the years 1991 to 1995, something of a purple patch for Disney before Pixar came in with &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; and started to sweep away all before it. We’re definitely talking about movies like &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt; and, of course, &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;. In between these videos, there would be reissues of older Disney movies like &lt;em&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/em&gt; (which I can remember seeing in a cinema in Havant at about the age of 5 and laughing my head off throughout), &lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt; and my favourite &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a little older than both my sisters, I guess that &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; resonated more with me both because I had been a cub scout and because it is basically an innocent coming of age tale with central characters that are almost exclusively male. This last point meant that from my point of view, &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; was less sappy than the others and I felt more comfortable watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2008 and I had just moved into my flat in St Albans. I was miserable: the job I had taken was not quite what I had expected, the commute was incredibly tiring and my downstairs neighbour was a crazy old guy who would have his television turned up to full volume from 6am onwards every morning. Nevertheless, I had at least got my first pay cheque so I went around HMV and bought a whole sack of DVDs. Last on the pile was &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt;, the rationale being that I needed something that would cheer me up and for it to be something that I could unashamedly play loud to counter the crazy old guy downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-i-love-it&quot;&gt;Why I love it&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; for three main reasons: it’s sweet and uplifting, it looks great and the songs are amazing. At heart, it is a movie about bravery, loyalty and friendship. This is presumably why &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling&quot;&gt;Rudyard Kipling’s&lt;/a&gt; story1 was such an influence on the scouting movement. It is wonderfully paced, a largely slow-moving and serene story punctuated with bursts of frenetic madness. It looks utterly gorgeous with a predominant palette of browns and greens while the cell animation is a masterful example of the craft, you only have to look at the horrible CG renditions of the characters on the recent DVD cover above to see that the transition to computers has not always brought with it better drawing and characterisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then those songs. &lt;em&gt;Bare Necessities&lt;/em&gt; is guaranteed to cheer me up every time I hear it, followed closely by &lt;em&gt;I Wanna Be Like You&lt;/em&gt;. These are songs that I know inside out and back to front: I often catch myself in the middle of singing them without knowing what prompted me to start. Meanwhile there are lesser songs that also work well in their context: &lt;em&gt;Trust In Me&lt;/em&gt;, Kaa’s song to the hypnotised Mowgli; the song of the marching elephants; the barbershop quartet of vultures who look like the Beatles about four years early and of course the song that the girl from the village sings about having to fetch the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall finish here, I want to go and watch it again now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-book&quot;&gt;The book&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have come to this post expecting a discussion of the book but I haven’t read it. I must do this one day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Maps And Charts</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/maps-and-charts"/>
   <updated>2011-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/maps-and-charts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up a framed print of a map hung on the wall in the hallway. It was one of my favourite things, littered with strange latin names and with Vs where Us should have been. The outlines of the continents and countries were all familiar and yet slightly distorted, becoming more recognisable around the shores of western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the provenance of that map print but at some point it got taken to the charity shop and replaced by Van Gogh’s sunflowers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I guess that means that I shall never be able to work out exactly what map it was and when it was from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway my point is that old maps are a great reminder of human imagination and collective consciousness. They may seem quaint now that we have Google maps and satellite photographs seared into our brains or available in app form for our phones. Even so, maps have certainly lied to us as recently as when we were children - all those maps in dusty atlases that taught us how Spain was as big as Africa (or rather, that Africa was as small as Spain&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, maps are different from the world they represent&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A Google map is not more accurate per se than a medieval one, it just encodes different (and differing amounts of) information. Therefore, even though we may now consider ourselves as a better collective notion of the world around us, we are in fact cleaving to the same delusion as our forebears who swapped V for U.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it is intriguing to note that five hundreds years ago a person was more likely to have walked over a given area of land and not know how it might look upon a map. Now they are more likely to know its place on a map and yet not have the experience of walking across it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this stems from the fact that I have thought a lot about mental maps lately, those spaces in our mind where we draw our impressions of how the world is and how it really works: the internal topographies that we build for our thoughts, ambitions and beliefs. Is there really a correct path to take through life and a map that guide us on our journey? Perhaps. You may be lucky enough to have a map but be warned, no matter the detail there will always be something missed. My advice then, is to draw the map as you go and include new landmark as you meet it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which has, no doubt, itself been consigned to the charity shop after my parents’ move to a smaller (but lovely!) flat. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These issues arise due to the nature of the projection employed, something worthy of a post of its own. I’ll add it to the list! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Just as the word “rose” is different from the flower/plant that it represents. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, June 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-june-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-june-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have had the sort of month that is not conducive to listening to much new music. Therefore this month’s post is only going to consider two new albums and two albums that I have bought behind time. Because of various bits of stress and poor mood, I have ended up going back and taking refuge in some old favourites and not listening to new stuff. At other points I have also gone back to the Fleet Foxes’ album that I wrote about last month, which has grown on me even more since. Sometimes I think that I should writing about these albums on a two month delay. Meanwhile, I even have new music that I haven’t listened to &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, namely &lt;strong&gt;Bon Iver&lt;/strong&gt;’s self-titled album. It has received so many good reviews that I have been too intimidated to listen to it. I will try to write about it next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead by way of brand new albums we have &lt;em&gt;Codes And Keys&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Death Cab For Cutie&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gloss Drop&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Battles&lt;/strong&gt;. Meanwhile on back order we have &lt;em&gt;Wounded Rhymes&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Lykke Li&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;These Re-imagined Machines&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;BT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with &lt;em&gt;Codes and Keys&lt;/em&gt;, we have a nice album that is better than their last album &lt;em&gt;Narrow Stairs&lt;/em&gt; though the best tracks don’t  square up with the best ones on the previous album. There &lt;em&gt;Bixby Canyon Bridge&lt;/em&gt; had a sadness that turned to cynicism over five minutes in a spectacular way and there is nothing to match that here. Meanwhile &lt;em&gt;Narrow Stairs&lt;/em&gt;’ other cracker &lt;em&gt;Long Division&lt;/em&gt; played out the highs from the previous Death Cab albums in a wonderfully catchy way, a task that falls to &lt;em&gt;Monday Morning&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Codes And Keys&lt;/em&gt; and the result is almost as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the remaining tracks are polite but lack any real bite. In some reviews, much was made of the synth sounds employed on the new material but to my ears it does not sound any more advanced than 2005’s &lt;em&gt;Plans&lt;/em&gt;, an album which had songs that were far more emotionally astute than those featured here. Meanwhile, nothing on &lt;em&gt;Plans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Narrow Stairs&lt;/em&gt; or the current album sounds like anything on &lt;em&gt;Give Up&lt;/em&gt;, the sole album that singer Ben Gibbard recorded as part of &lt;strong&gt;The Postal Service&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a shame that Death Cab have fallen back a bit in their songwriting and it remains to be seen whether they can pull up from the current nose-diving career trajectory that comfort, appearances in soft focus songtages and stadium sized gigs has led them into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Battles&lt;/strong&gt; are another band softening their edges on their second full album &lt;em&gt;Gloss Drop&lt;/em&gt;. Having lost uber-experimentalist and focal point Toyandai Braxton, you might think that the band might become overly indulgent and dull. While the energy expenditure is a bit more economic than on &lt;em&gt;Mirrored&lt;/em&gt;, I think that although there’s nothing to match &lt;em&gt;Atlas&lt;/em&gt; this is a very fine album indeed. For me, &lt;em&gt;Mirrored&lt;/em&gt; was often a little too angular for its own good and the transcendant moments like the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Atlas&lt;/em&gt; stood out simply because rhythms were allowed to build and then soar away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A softly softly approach to the fiddly motorik polyrhythms that Battles are so fond yields great dividends, producing an album you can march along to or sit down and really lose yourself inside of. Even if there aren’t quite as many breathtaking moments here as on &lt;em&gt;Mirrored&lt;/em&gt;, it is much more fun and the guest spots are well-posistioned to provide embellishments to the sound. Of the four additional contributors, I’d only heard of Matias Aguayo and Gary Numan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matias Aguayo’s contribution is to &lt;em&gt;Ice Cream&lt;/em&gt;, which is very much in his style of minimal electronic music based around samples of the human voice. What is so successful about the track is that it could sit quite comfortably on either &lt;em&gt;Mirrored&lt;/em&gt; or Aguayo’s own masterpiece of last year &lt;em&gt;Ay Ay Ay&lt;/em&gt;. When two collaborators manage to capture both of their signature sounds when working together, you know that it’s a worthwhile collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d suspect that Gary Numan’s is a little more phoned in on &lt;em&gt;My Machines&lt;/em&gt; especially given that I hardly noticed the track at all on the first few listens. A few more run throughs though and sure enough, there he was warbling away and giving the impression that have been there in his car for a day or two. The other two collabs are also pretty subtle: this is because they are vocal contributions and much of what is thrilling about Battles’ music is the tightness and complete mastery of the rhythm section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to that catch up albums now and the first of these is &lt;em&gt;These Re-imagined Machines&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of remixes of tracks from the album &lt;em&gt;These Hopeful Machines&lt;/em&gt;, which was released about a year ago. While these remixes do not add much more to the original tracks, which were also long and progressive, they do dial up the beats and get moving a lot quicker than the originals, which often got lost in a morass of found sound and quiet moments. Interestingly enough there is yet another version of the album, &lt;em&gt;These Humble Machines&lt;/em&gt;, which consists of the original album edited back to a single CD (the original is 12 tracks spanning two discs). I’ve yet to find a suitably priced download of this yet but if I do, it is certainly something that I will investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the remixes have driven me back to both the original album and to the rest of BT’s back catalogue as I have quite a lot of it in my collection. The other day I had a great time listening to both &lt;em&gt;Flaming June&lt;/em&gt; (while I had the chance!) and &lt;em&gt;Nectar&lt;/em&gt; off &lt;em&gt;ESCM&lt;/em&gt;. I also listened to the whole of &lt;em&gt;Emotional Technology&lt;/em&gt; while debugging some code at work the other day and it was much better than I remembered. Nevertheless,  &lt;em&gt;Movement In Still-Life&lt;/em&gt; remains my favourite of his albums for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have &lt;em&gt;Wounded Rhymes&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Lykke Li&lt;/strong&gt;, which I have been after ever since I caught her on Later With Jools Holland alongside &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-february-2011/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PJ Harvey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ed Sheeran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I really like this album because it satisfies at least two of my major criteria: it’s short and it has attitude. I’m loathe to tease out a whole load of comparisons because there’s so many that I could make that it starts to feel redundant to do so. Here she sounds like Marina Topley-Bird, there she sounds like Nina from the Cardigans (yes, that is lazy swede-on-swede comparison at work) and elsewhere she sounds like the most amazing torch singer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs themselves rock from side to side, all bluster and dynamism one minute (&lt;em&gt;Youth Knows No Pain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Get Some&lt;/em&gt;), then insistent introspection (&lt;em&gt;I Follow Rivers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sadness Is A Blessing&lt;/em&gt;) and on to outright emoting (&lt;em&gt;Love Out Of Lust&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I Know Places&lt;/em&gt;). All the while the rhythm section (when required) is tight and together, making everything sound like the work of a band rather than that of a bunch of session musicians surrounding a solo artist. Meanwhile, no song overstays its welcome - even the six minute &lt;em&gt;I Know Places&lt;/em&gt;  actually finishes in four and plays out with a gentle ambient coda. This makes for an intense and varied forty minutes that makes me want to put it on over and over again. I rarely ask for more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Much like KT Tunstall’s appearance on &lt;em&gt;Later…&lt;/em&gt;, Ed Sheeran’s appears to have been a real breakout performance. I really like the song he performed, &lt;em&gt;The A-team&lt;/em&gt;, but I really did not expect it to break out in the way that it has. Perhaps an indicator that people do still recognise a good song when they hear one? Or at least that Later still reaches the tastemakers? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #10: Tubular Bells II by Mike Oldfield</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-10"/>
   <updated>2011-06-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-10</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I admit that it was the artwork that got interested in Tubular Bells II. Trevor Key’s wonderful icon of the twisted tubular bell is even more mysterious rendered in yellow and blue. It aroused my curiosity when I saw it one day in Woolworth’s in Leigh Park back in 1992. The huge display must have been part of WEA’s massive publicity drive for an album that represented huge potential for sales even though Mike Oldfield’s stock had then been dwindling for a long time. At that point Oldfield had not made a good album since his soundtrack to the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Killing Fields&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, the end of a hot streak (perhaps 1980’s &lt;em&gt;QE2&lt;/em&gt; aside) that had lasted since the original &lt;em&gt;Tubular Bells&lt;/em&gt; back in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some fans cite &lt;em&gt;Amorok&lt;/em&gt; in 1990 as a sign that his abilities were still intact. Indeed it was intended as “Ommadawn II” but for me, thinking of it as wilfully noodly, inconsistent and inpenetrable are not signs of “cloth ears” (as the artwork would have you believe) but the sign of a bored maestro in decline. However, it was certainly a spark of life - perhaps one that proved that a rejuvenation was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result Tubular Bells II was a game changer for Oldfield and it shows throughout. It might seem at the outset like a dull exercise in cash grabbing but it was in fact a chance to rejuvenate and revisit one of the best rock albums of the 1970s, a decade with its fair share of gems. The best decision was to draft in Trevor Horn in production: there are ideas bubbling under the surface that are not present in any of Mike Oldfield’s previous albums and not even in the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I believe the sequel is the understated classic and not the original? The first reason is that there is already a critical consensus that the first &lt;em&gt;Tubular Bells&lt;/em&gt; is a classic album and so there is nothing understated about its status, whereas its sequel is unfairly tarnished with being a money grabbing exercise as I have already said. The second reason is that it was the first &lt;em&gt;Tubular Bells&lt;/em&gt; album I encountered and so for me at least, it becomes the classic over and above the original. The third reason is that it is a perfect example of how to give an album well produced sheen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequel follows its parent closely for most of the running time though there are various flourishes that extend the running time by about ten minutes compared to the original. Some of this extra running time comes at the start with the famous windchime-like figure supplanted by a solo piano intro, an important feature for setting the two albums apart. The piano sound is strong, clear and strident in a way that the original never was (even on the many remasters that have appeared since). The false step that results from not using the main theme immediately does take away that feeling of being out in the elements - when you put on the original album you instantly feel as though you have been taken outside to some windy hillside. The effect on the sequel is more spacey, one of stars coming out, which given that the opening section/track is named after an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_(short_story)&quot;&gt;Arthur C. Clarke short story&lt;/a&gt;, it is quite appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst Tubular Bells II is split into individual tracks, it’s probably best to focus on the two halves as part one and part two as per the original. Back then, part one (or side one if you like) had been developed for much longer while the second half was much more ramshackle, having been completed as the album was recorded. As a result the original &lt;em&gt;Tubular Bells&lt;/em&gt; was uneven. &lt;em&gt;Tubular Bells II&lt;/em&gt; does a lot to redress this imbalance. The second half is now as polished as the first. It is also given a new intro which winds into the more familiar theme but with a much more insistent pulse. This is particularly good when you listen to the album in one sitting as provides connective tissue between the acoustic outro of part one and the panpipes of part two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless the second half inherits the flaws of the original. &lt;em&gt;Altered State&lt;/em&gt; attempts to update of the original’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://tubular.net/forums/?s=fdbc51f35d0e57215d01623c95609cec&amp;act;=ST;f=19;t=805&quot;&gt;infamous “Piltdown Man” section&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a brave stab at revising something that was originally raw and improvised. It is interesting and kooky but draws so much attention to itself that falls flat. Meanwhile, the decision to update the section of the original that featured “guitars that sound like bagpipes” with &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; bagpipes has limited replay value. Especially when guitars-that-sounds-like-bagpipes are used anyway: the moment when a coruscating riff from the same enters the fray is the only moment where overproduction smears and rather than polishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one of the best bits of &lt;em&gt;Tubular Bells II&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Maya Gold&lt;/em&gt;, the next to last section of side two that has a succession of shimmering guitar riffs that overlap and overtake one another in slow waves, like a reflection of the moon in the ripples of a lake. Best of all is a bass guitar line that gives me the shivers every time that I hear it, one of the best bass guitar sounds ever committed to tape. There is a moment of silence as the track ends before &lt;em&gt;Moonshine&lt;/em&gt; lurches to life as the hooch-laced bluegrass inbred cousin of the original’s &lt;em&gt;Sailor’s Hornpipe&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a strange bit of fun that ends what is largely a serious record (perhaps even more so than the original) and much like the Hornpipe it works even though it shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There is apparently a jungle version of &lt;em&gt;Moonshine&lt;/em&gt; with some extremely dodgy toasting on it, I urge you to check it out on YouTube but in all conscience cannot embed it here! There’s also a slightly less atrocious version that sounds like the middle ground between The Grid’s &lt;em&gt;Swamp Thing&lt;/em&gt; and Rednex’s &lt;em&gt;Cotton Eye Joe&lt;/em&gt; - this is why researching these posts is such fun!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll close with embeds of the video for the &lt;em&gt;Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; single and a fan video for &lt;em&gt;Maya Gold&lt;/em&gt; as these are my favourite bits.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What’s your favourite number?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was ambivalent on this issue until a few months ago until I came across the following quirky result: if you start with the prime number 41 and then add 2 you get 43, which is also prime and then if you add 4 to 43, you get 47: also prime. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=evaluate+x^2%E2%88%92x%2B41+for+x+from+0..40&quot;&gt;And this continues to produce prime numbers if you add successive multiples of two to your running total&lt;/a&gt;, UNTIL… you get to the 41st number in this sequence, which is 41 squared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is actually nothing magical about this, it’s just a freak result that probably arises from both the appeal to the human eye for this kind of neatness and the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/cyc/p/primeprf.htm&quot;&gt;there are infinitely many prime numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, 41 was the answer that I gave to Alex Bellos’s survey to find out people’s favourite numbers. If you want to participate, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.favouritenumber.net/&quot;&gt;you can do so here&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>J. G. Ballard, Concrete Island</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/concrete-island"/>
   <updated>2011-06-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/concrete-island</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-man-is-an-island-not-any-more&quot;&gt;No man is an island (not any more)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are tracked pretty much everywhere you go. CCTV, the GPS on your phone or the signals sent by your more primitive model to the masts to keep in touch with the network. Your cash withdrawals, your purchases in Tesco and your journeys on public transport all add to the picture of where you are. If you drive, your sat nav will hold clues to where you have been and, if you disappear, where you might have gone to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this then makes the premise of &lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt; (1974) rather redundant nearly forty years on. So while it is an altogether more seemly and precise read compared to &lt;a href=&quot;2011/02/crash/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1973), it is rather harder to suspend belief. The fraught tensions of our inner sexual lives may not have changed in that time (or rather we still hold to a collective belief that something darker may lurk within us, ready to be drawn out by all that chrome and speed) but our ability to turn Robinson Crusoe most certainly has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt;, a middle-aged man (once again Ballard-by-proxy, one assumes) crashes his silver Jaguar over the embankment of the newly built Westway interchange. Injured, he tries and fails to attract the attention of passing traffic before being rescued by a community that live on “the island”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the introduction, Ballard compares the novel to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robinson Crusoe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and while the comparison must hold some water, the novelty of the tropical island setting is to this day what captivates the reader. It may have been possible in 1974 to believe that someone could be ‘shipwrecked’ on a large interchange but in 2011 it is not so convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;a href=&quot;the-drowned-world&quot;&gt;we have been here before&lt;/a&gt; and advances in technology sometimes outstrip science fiction, even though we could argue that &lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt; does not set out to be science fiction any more than &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt; does. At least &lt;em&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/em&gt; contained a sufficient number of outré creatures, characters and scenarios so that the reader can take the mistakes with a pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;the-drowned-world&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ballard wrote a follow-up in &lt;a href=&quot;the-drought&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drought&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was less surreal and more grounded in reality. It seems that &lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;crash&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are similarly designed to be two sides of the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, we have &lt;em&gt;High-Rise&lt;/em&gt;, the last of a loose trilogy that contends that modern life is rubbish!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Four albums this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kate Bush &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Africa Hitech &lt;em&gt;93 Million Miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fleet Foxes &lt;em&gt;Helplessness Blues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TV On The Radio &lt;em&gt;Nine Types of Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a pleasing red hue to all the covers this month. I had time to write four full reviews of the major albums I listened to. Like last month I have included a video at the foot of each review. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kate-bush-directors-cut&quot;&gt;Kate Bush &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is not a new album from Kate Bush but a collection of re-visits to old songs, four from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sensual_World&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sensual World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1989) and seven from [&lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(album) (1993). It is certainly an interesting idea to re-examine old songs with hindsight, something usually only done with live albums or dodgy remixes. It is rare to have an artist to even admit flaws in their earlier material, let alone for them to go back and attempt to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the project depends on how much you buy into whether the rehashing of old material is value for money and whether you believe that the songs need alteration in the first place. For me, I can buy into the first thing - I am always curious to hear multiple versions and re-interpretations. On the second issue I am more ambivalent because I happen to really like &lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt; and yet have never felt that much of a connection to &lt;em&gt;The Sensual World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we tackle the songs from &lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt; first, I feel a bit cheated that she didn’t do all twelve songs. I would preferred for new versions of the tracks that weren’t so strong. Because &lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt; was an album that I enjoyed as I was really starting to love music (age 13 onwards), I am very attached to the songs and particularly the ones that have been re-recorded. I would have loved a new version of &lt;em&gt;You’re The One&lt;/em&gt;, a song that is rather painful for me to listen to for personal reasons, because it might have taken away my own personal context around the song. This is just selfish nit-picking of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes’&lt;/em&gt; songs are re-trod well, I particularly like the new version of &lt;em&gt;Lily&lt;/em&gt;, while the title track is brilliant in either version. I wasn’t sure about the new version of &lt;em&gt;Rubberband Girl&lt;/em&gt; at first simply because the original is such a pop delight (albeit an unconventional one) but the new arrangement does better suit what the song is actually about. Perhaps the one revelation is the new version of &lt;em&gt;Top Of The City&lt;/em&gt;, given that it now sits well with the songs around it, instead of passing me by as it did on the original album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs from &lt;em&gt;The Sensual World&lt;/em&gt; are less well-known to me. I remember listening to the original version of &lt;em&gt;Deeper Understanding&lt;/em&gt; on my way home to St Albans one cold evening before Christmas a few years ago, mainly because the subject of the song seemed so in tune with my situation back then. A man who is lonely turns to love at the screen of his computer - the new version has a video featuring Robbie Coltrane as me in 2009 (see below). The problem with the new version is that in eschewing the original’s vocodered computer voice for something constructed entirely in the machine, it has ended up sounding like Mr Burns in the X-Files episode of The Simpsons: “I bring you peeeeeeace!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like &lt;em&gt;Flower of the Mountain&lt;/em&gt;, it sounds a lot like &lt;em&gt;King of the Mountain&lt;/em&gt; off &lt;em&gt;Aerial&lt;/em&gt; and I am not sure the irish pipes over the end are that interesting probably because the words are different and I didn’t really have that great a connection to the original. A lack of connection to the original is also true for &lt;em&gt;Never Be Mine&lt;/em&gt; (perhaps a why not tackling &lt;em&gt;You’re The One&lt;/em&gt;) but I am going to have to re-listen to the original a lot in this case because it is a cracking song. Meanwhile, the reworking of &lt;em&gt;This Woman’s Work&lt;/em&gt; turns it into an amazing ambient ballad that just seems to hang around and coo into your ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I listened to &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; I was on a rare peak time tube journey, the combination of the intimate sonics and my new seal-out-the-world earphones completely transported from what is normally a very stressful scenario for me to a place of complete calm. For that reason and because &lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt; is so special to me, I really recommend this album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;africa-hitech-93-million-miles&quot;&gt;Africa Hitech &lt;em&gt;93 Million Miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t pretend to have an exhaustive knowledge of electronic music but when I saw that &lt;em&gt;93 Million Miles&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://africahitech.com/&quot;&gt;Africa Hitech&lt;/a&gt; was a collaboration between Mark Pritchard and Steve Spacek  released on &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Warp Records&lt;/a&gt;, my curiosity was well and truly piqued. To be honest, I didn’t have a clue who Steve Spacek was and I only really knew of Mark Pritchard from his remixes, he did a rather cracking one of &lt;em&gt;Once More&lt;/em&gt; by The Orb - no mean feat because the original was not one of the Orb’s finer tracks. It was a bit of a face-palm moment when I discovered he was also one half of Global Communication and so partly responsible for that awesome remix of Lamb’s &lt;em&gt;Gorecki&lt;/em&gt; - you know the one and if you don’t, call me and I will play it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;em&gt;93 Million Miles&lt;/em&gt; has a nice cover and a good pedigree so it was definitely worth a punt. I don’t think I am choosing one album over all the others this month because they are all so good but it probably trumps most of the albums I have written about in the digests up to now. This is mainly because, as I have often mentioned, I have been after a really good new electronic album for some time. &lt;em&gt;93 Million Miles&lt;/em&gt; meets this need easily, it sounds fresh and new and it sounds abstract while still being chunky and huggable enough to bounce along to on the way to work. The opening titular track sounds like a cross between Kraftwerk and dubstep (hey, there is a reason why I am not a professional music writer!), detailing various physical constants including the titular one - the distance from the earth to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that &lt;em&gt;Do You Wanna Fight?&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Out In The Street&lt;/em&gt; gradually raise the pace to frenetic, the latter starting to sound by the end like an afrobeat version of The Prodigy’s &lt;em&gt;Theme From Speedway&lt;/em&gt; off &lt;em&gt;Music For The Jilted Generation&lt;/em&gt;. There is a youtube capture of that track at the foot of this review. The next track &lt;em&gt;Future Moves&lt;/em&gt; is probably the most abstract and “Warp-like” track here, a commanding bass-squelch with a glassy synths making intricate patterns over the top. It’s also chocka with analogue (or analogue-sounding) synths, which are pretty much a direct link to the centre of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard_brain&quot;&gt;lizard brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall save you from my awkward descriptions of the remaining tracks but it is all very good. Of particular note is &lt;em&gt;Our Luv&lt;/em&gt;, a track that is probably even more Kraftwerkian than the title track - a big stomping tune with some warm chunky synth sounds and a disinterested vocodered vocal that means as much as any other element in the tune, and &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt;, which is a variation on the other tracks that features some big drum lines that the Afro-Celt Sound System would be proud of. Elsewhere the focus is almost entirely on a propulsive core layered over with interesting melodies and deep rich synth sounds, as though taking the best of electronic music’s gold age (1995 to 1997, as we’ll discuss in the understated classics series some time soon) and marrying it with some more modern rhythms. It sounds as good on headphones in the sunshine as it does coming out of laptop speakers in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fleet-foxes-helplessness-blues&quot;&gt;Fleet Foxes &lt;em&gt;Helplessness Blues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate having to say that I loved Fleet Foxes’ two EPs but not their début album. It makes me sound like one of those jerks who hates bands for becoming popular. Don’t fear though, I have resolutely populist tastes. In a way those tastes are responsible for my reaction to the début album, it seemed like a band with a demonstrable talent for writing great songs (see &lt;em&gt;Mykonos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;In The Hot Hot Rays&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Icicle Tusk&lt;/em&gt;) had got a bit too caught up in a folky sound. Worse still, the singer seemed to have equated bellowing his a capella lyrics with “really meaning it”. To my ears, the album soon grated and I really didn’t listen to all that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So listening to the NPR stream of Fleet Foxes’ second album &lt;em&gt;Helplessness Blues&lt;/em&gt; was a pleasant surprise. Listening to it through, it seems the excesses of the first album (as I perceived them) were really dialled back and it seemed that this was another great batch of songs like those on the EPs. I fear that typing out all the songs that I think are great would simply repeat the track list. Here is an attempt to mention the outstanding stuff: the bluegrass violin on &lt;em&gt;Bedouin Dress&lt;/em&gt; is a real delight; the delicate shadows in both the lyrics and arrangements of &lt;em&gt;Sim Sala Bim&lt;/em&gt;; the wise advice and strike-for-life that oozes out of the title track and the gentle emulation of Mike Oldfield’s great 1970s albums on &lt;em&gt;The Cascades&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it appears late on in the album, the epitome of the songs here is perhaps the double-header &lt;em&gt;The Shrine/An Argument&lt;/em&gt;. You do have to be wary of the old throw two songs together and put the show on here routine but in this case (and earlier on in the album) it kind of works. The first is a quiet and sinister trip “down to the dust and the pollen” to the old stones of the titular shrine, a tale that echoes many of those told on this album and the first. It’s sweet with plenty of the wonderful harmony vocals that make Fleet Foxes so compelling, it even has some of the vocal stylings that I found annoying on the first album but are forgivable here. It soon slips into &lt;em&gt;The Argument&lt;/em&gt;, which is longer with a more traditional structure (with more mentions of Innisfree) and it then breaks down into an extended instrumental jam at the end (via a reprise of the acoustic tune), complete with skronky sax and treated violins. It is a nice touch taking that song somewhere different; sometimes a wig out is a symptom of “difficult second album syndrome” but I think here it’s a legitimate direction, particularly when it is then followed up by the &lt;em&gt;Blue Spotted Tail&lt;/em&gt;, an acoustic number that sounds like something off Paul McCartney’s first solo album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really like &lt;em&gt;Grown Ocean&lt;/em&gt;, which is a great radio-friendly song that almost seems tacked on at the end. It means that the album pretty much closes with the feeling that it is just getting started again, perhaps it is a clever trick to make it all sound good on repeat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tv-on-the-radio-nine-types-of-light&quot;&gt;TV On The Radio &lt;em&gt;Nine Types Of Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel embarrassed for two things about &lt;em&gt;Nine Types Of Light&lt;/em&gt;, the new album by TV On The Radio. The first is that I have only just got around to hearing it and the second is that my only reference point for how they sound on the chorus of the first song &lt;em&gt;Second Song&lt;/em&gt; is the Scissor Sisters. It’s a great tune though, definitely one for getting you up and moving in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am starting to really like TV On The Radio. I first noticed them after seeing the amazing video to the single &lt;em&gt;Wolf Like Me&lt;/em&gt; and even though I found its parent album &lt;em&gt;Return To Cookie Mountain&lt;/em&gt; to be a bit angular for my tastes, I persevered with &lt;em&gt;Dear Science&lt;/em&gt;, which was probably one of 2008’s best albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is funny how as I have got older I have begun to obsess over every aspect of a band less and less. Is this because I am not looking for influences for my identity, is it because I listen to so much more music now, is it because the information is easier to find on the internet? I am not sure. All I know is that I know next to nothing about this band even though I love their songs!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think this is a great album (it’s been a very good month). While there is nothing as good as &lt;em&gt;Halfway Home&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Golden Age&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Family Tree&lt;/em&gt; off &lt;em&gt;Dear Science&lt;/em&gt;, it’s very solid collection once again. From that Scissor Sister chorus on &lt;em&gt;Second Song&lt;/em&gt; to the gorgeous crooning on &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; to the clever and topical lyric of &lt;em&gt;Repetition&lt;/em&gt;: “What’s the matter with your next door neighbour? / I heard he had sex, drugs and danger / but you can kick it with a complete stranger / I think I hear him calling”. Actually the good bit is the stuff about the bankers: “I can choose my victims and I can shed my skin / and if the world keeps turning I can do it again”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s a good solid album that I need to listen to a bit more. My main emotional connections at the moment are to &lt;em&gt;Second Song&lt;/em&gt;, the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Repetition&lt;/em&gt; and the wonderful post-apocalyptic dreamscape of &lt;em&gt;Forgotten&lt;/em&gt;. I remember writing rather odd praise of PJ Harvey’s &lt;em&gt;Let England Shake&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;2011/02/album-digest-february-2011/&quot;&gt;back in February&lt;/a&gt; and not realising how utterly fantastic it was until I’d really got to know all the songs some time later. I think there’s a similar situation. In the mean time, &lt;em&gt;Nine Types Of Light&lt;/em&gt; has my heartfelt recommendation, as with the other albums I’ve talked about this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why is it important to know stuff about bands anyway? Well, later on when you are old and lonely you can write about the albums you love on your own website. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #9: Tiger Bay by Saint Etienne</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-09"/>
   <updated>2011-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-09</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt; is Saint Etienne’s third album and I think it is among their best. It was released in June 1994 on Heavenly records. I first owned a copy in 1998 when I picked it up while living in halls as an undergraduate. The reason for including this album in the understated classics series is the same as for &lt;a href=&quot;uc8&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Dreadzone: it marries traditional forms to newer electronic music&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; melds classical music and sea shanties to house and dub reggae to evoke the rolling hills and mystic caves of England. &lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt; grafts folk structures on to Balearic pop songs and electronic experiments in order to visit motorway verges, windswept seashores, and Mediterranean holidays. There is even a ghost story (&lt;em&gt;Boy Scouts of America&lt;/em&gt;) for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overture&quot;&gt;Overture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album opens sprightly with &lt;em&gt;Urban Clearaway&lt;/em&gt;, an instrumental that evokes a drive out along the motorway into the countryside. A motorik beat underpins to give it that road trip vibe. String pads weave outwards as the track concludes making it into a pretty little journey of a song. You could describe it as “Neu! on the M25”, but that would hide just how cinematic and velvety the string arrangement is. If Kraftwerk and Neu! were good at showing us the aesthetics and the kinetics of the autobahn, Saint Etienne reproduce it together with the expectation and excitement of travelling to somewhere new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;songs-and-singles-instrumentals-and-demos&quot;&gt;Songs and singles, instrumentals and demos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next track &lt;em&gt;Former Lover&lt;/em&gt; is a wonderfully wistful song that plays out over a lush folksy acoustic guitar motif, which makes an obvious contrast to the next track &lt;em&gt;Hug My Soul&lt;/em&gt;. Throughout the of the album there is a clear distinction between songs written by Bob Stanley and Ian Wiggs2, and those written by Sarah Cracknell and her collaborators3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two singles off the album were &lt;em&gt;Hug My Soul&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pale Movie&lt;/em&gt;. These are among two of the finest pop songs that Saint Etienne ever produced. It is a shame that Bob Stanley is a bit snooty about them in the liner notes of the recent reissue. In particular he did not like how &lt;em&gt;Pale Movie&lt;/em&gt; was chosen as the first single over &lt;em&gt;Like A Motorway&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Like A Motorway&lt;/em&gt; is a fine song, with some cracking remixes4, and it may have been better at tempting to listeners to the album than a throwaway pop song. In some ways the band are a victim of their own considerable production skills as the demo of &lt;em&gt;Pale Movie&lt;/em&gt; included in the reissue is more in keeping with the rest of &lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt;. At the same time it also manages to sound a bit like &lt;em&gt;Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood&lt;/em&gt; by Santa Esmerelda. Dig out the soundtrack to &lt;em&gt;Kill Bill vol. 1&lt;/em&gt; to see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On The Shore&lt;/em&gt; has some burbling synth and a superb windswept vocal from Shara Nelson. It also has perhaps the most annoying frog-like sound on a record before &lt;em&gt;The Crazy Frog_5, a sort of mechanised ribbit that repeats throughout the track. I would dearly love to hear a version of this track without that noise. Perhaps there is a frog-free demo somewhere? Talking of demos, four are included with the reissue. These are _Western Wind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hug My Soul&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pale Movie&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Urban Clearaway&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a nice selection from the album’s broad pallete of styles. Most of the demos are darker and more forceful. If this is also the case with early versions of &lt;em&gt;On The Shore&lt;/em&gt; then its demo would be worth a listen even if the frog noise is still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-spooky-suite&quot;&gt;The spooky suite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three tracks form a suite of superb spooky tunes. It starts with &lt;em&gt;Cool Kids Of Death&lt;/em&gt;, a skanking instrumental that is quite sinister, particularly in the Underworld remix that features on &lt;em&gt;Casino Classics&lt;/em&gt;. I like the repeated melodica figure, the dub bass, the snares, and the keyboard stabs throughout: pretty much all of it really. I like the fact that something this simple can get you up and moving and yet still fit into the overall tone of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the reissue, three tracks have been fused into one - the instrumental &lt;em&gt;Tankerville&lt;/em&gt;, bookended by two versions of the folk song &lt;em&gt;Western Wind&lt;/em&gt;. One version is sung by Sarah Cracknell and the other by guest vocalist Stephen Duffy. In between, Tankerville uses the same mixture of beats, guitar and strings that works so well throughout the rest of the album to create a soundcape. Judging by the fact that the demo of &lt;em&gt;Western Wind&lt;/em&gt; is four minutes long and features some interesting &lt;em&gt;Tankerville&lt;/em&gt;-esque sonics in the middle, it is likely that the whole ensemble originally came together like that. What I like is how right at the centre of it, as the strings and the synths burble away, you get completely lost in the mental pictures that the music creates. In this way, the instrumentals on &lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt; are like &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/09/understated-classics-4/&quot;&gt;other music&lt;/a&gt; that I have &lt;a href=&quot;uc6&quot;&gt;covered before&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;these posts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we reach &lt;em&gt;Boy Scouts Of America&lt;/em&gt;. I said earlier that it was a ghost story. I am not totally sure that this is true but it is indeed spooky. It is one of those wonderfully open-ended story-songs that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858692814/&quot;&gt;in three verses and twenty-four lines&lt;/a&gt; manages to tell a story that would take a film much longer to navigate. From the opening line (“Like a birthday card from a previous year”) to the last (“The Boy Scouts of America taught him all that he knows”), the characters are amorphous and their roles are uncertain. Why is the man guarding the woman? Why does she hug the sheets? What is the hidden heartache that causes the man’s veil of coolness to slip? There are so many questions and yet the song just shifts into focus and out again without overstaying its welcome. After just three minutes the strings fade into the noises of passing trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-tiger-bay&quot;&gt;Beyond Tiger Bay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saint Etienne are among my favourite bands. I think the blend of great pop songs, great stories and great arrangements lead me back to them time and time again. Whether it is the crazy nonlinear stories inside of nine-minute dance tracks like &lt;em&gt;How We Used To Live&lt;/em&gt; (from &lt;em&gt;Sound Of Water&lt;/em&gt;) or the wonderful slice-of-life duet &lt;em&gt;Relocate&lt;/em&gt; (from &lt;em&gt;Tales From Turnpike House&lt;/em&gt;), there is always plenty to enjoy. However, when it comes to a whole album experience, whether by Saint Etienne or by anyone else, you can’t beat &lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I use relative terms here, dance music is very new compared to the folk music that is referenced throughout &lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt;). However electronic music is not really new. It has infiltrated popular music for over thirty years, so why do I keep doing referring to it as new?! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Five Superheroes We Can Live Without</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/five-superheroes-we-can-live-without"/>
   <updated>2011-05-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/five-superheroes-we-can-live-without</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day while writing some rather self-pitying notes in my blog book (yes, I handwrite all this rubbish before I go to bed at night!) I came up with some useless superheroes, or rather the only superheroes that a washed-up guy in his early thirties could hope to be. Because I haven’t got any ideas for “five things on the fifth” this month, I decided to flesh out a few of these. Last month I began the five on the fifth meme with &lt;a href=&quot;five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep&quot;&gt;five things to try if you can’t sleep&lt;/a&gt; and so this is a rather forced attempt to keep it going. I promise that I will try and think of more interesting posts on these lines for months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that this idea is not particularly new, there’s that film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132347/&quot;&gt;Mystery Men&lt;/a&gt; (complete with inspired turn from Tom Waits) about a bunch of superheroes who really have no powers at all and of course in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen&quot;&gt;Watchmen&lt;/a&gt; the superheroes are merely vigilantes. Of course these characters started from me being self-deprecating about myself and my flaws, growing up from there. Without further I introduce you to my washed-up coterie of superhero has-beens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Groundhog&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA &lt;em&gt;Revision man&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Mr. Hindsight&lt;/em&gt;). Special powers: is able to learn from his mistakes; does things over and over again until he gets them right; understands whatever the hell it is that is going on. Cape colour: Royal blue. Weaknesses: A bit boring in bed; highly susceptible to arch nemesis Professor Temptron’s Impulse-o-matic ray.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Confidence&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA &lt;em&gt;Quite-nice-man&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Purple Deserveling&lt;/em&gt;). Special powers: aces job interviews and first dates; is able to explain job title and role to strangers without embarassment; can remember names, faces and birthdays of others; doesn’t envy the infinitely more interesting love lives of others; has innate sense of self-worth. Colour of tight superhero spandex leggings: Black. Weaknesses: Can’t drive; somewhat prone to simple traps when Walnut cake is used as bait; fondness for colour purple.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bosun Higgs&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA &lt;em&gt;Cap’n Puntacular&lt;/em&gt;). Special powers: shock and awe puns; up to the minute topical levity; great ideas for hashtags on twitter; chat up lines that end with a punch in the face; ability to resist chocolate hobnob biscuits at four thirty on a warm Thursday afternoon; always has a fantastic plastic cutlass ready for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html&quot;&gt;International Talk Like A Pirate Day&lt;/a&gt;. Colour of superhero helmet: Purple (shush now!). Weaknesses: Funerals; the burning desire to be despicably inappropriate around people in authority; utter lack of knowledge about particle physics that, ironically, would help him understand the puns behind the names of his unknown nemeses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Conditioning Tolerance Man&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA &lt;em&gt;Jack Frost Esq.&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Freezle Weasel&lt;/em&gt;). Special powers: Able to tolerate air conditioning in a British summer even longer than a sweaty American; has rainbows for flatulence; underarm deodorant is effective for up to seven years after application; can withstand dry nostrils for up to six hours without attempting to extract brain through nose with own index finger. Colour of slightly glittery superhero shoulder pads: Silver. Weaknesses: Begins to melt at temperatures greater than eight degrees centigrade; regards all people who don’t want the air conditioner on as being from a primitive civilisation and tends to patronise them; a little bit withdrawn at parties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Centre&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA &lt;em&gt;Bobby The Balance&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Middletron&lt;/em&gt;). Special powers: Remains calm in the face of rhetoric and propaganda; able to detect someone’s agenda from over fifty paces; can construct life saving devices from office equipment like a health and safety McGuyver. Colour of superhero gloves: Berry red. Weaknesses: Can be weakened by the Daily Mail much in the way that Clark Kent is weakened by Kryptonite; actually not that good at things involving hand-eye co-ordination; terribly ambivalent in relationships and never gets into cathartic arguments; not very good at smiling sincerely in photographs; lightweight when it comes to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that’s all. For some of them I did have a back story worked out. For example, Bosun Higgs gained his powers when he was accidentally hit by a pun accelerator on “Dress down as a pirate day” while working at CERN, although I am not actually sure what one of those would be for.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, April 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-april-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-april-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-of-the-month-mirrorwriting-by-jamie-woon&quot;&gt;Album of the month: &lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; by Jamie Woon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Woon was brought to my attention late last year by Pitchfork who wrote an article about the video for lead single &lt;em&gt;Night Air&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve put that video down below because I think that it is very good, a simple well executed and the tune itself is brilliant, probably my favourite individual track of 2010. It’s a downtempo tune full of dark spaces and empty beats, full of nocturnal promise and mystery. Hungry for more, I also bought the &lt;em&gt;Wayfaring Stranger&lt;/em&gt; EP and pre-ordered &lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; as soon as it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that got Pitchfork so excited was that Burial had provided a remix of &lt;em&gt;Wayfaring Stranger&lt;/em&gt; and had also provided co-production on &lt;em&gt;Night Air&lt;/em&gt;. The first impression was of a young pop star (actually he’s 27) under the influence of one of the most exciting producers of recent times, suddenly it seemed as though there was a potential for 2011 to be an interesting year for pop music and that Jamie Woon would be at the forefront of it. Naturally, that isn’t really the case and he has been at pains in interviews to say that he sought out Will Bevan (Burial) for help on some aspects of production, and not to write songs or to decide their direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result &lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; is not the proxy Burial album that many may have expected. That said, the three tracks where Bevan adds production touches are easily the best on the album and it is unfortunate that these are also the first three tracks. Mind you, if you had asked me after my first listen to pick out which tracks had a Burial sound, I would have only got one right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the remaining tracks &lt;em&gt;Shoulda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spirits&lt;/em&gt; are lovely, if a bit boy band. It has that lovely melancholy quality and really brings out the quality of his voice, which is excellent throughout the album. His voice has an elastic quality that allows him produce a really smooth sound that really wraps around a tune without being too showy, no weird lung-busting fist clench moments here - the wine glass remains resolutely unshattered. Elsewhere,  tracks that are pretty much a capella to show off his pipes, the most successful being &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt;, which was the B-side of &lt;em&gt;Wayfaring Stranger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; is a very good début, even if it does sag in the middle a bit with &lt;em&gt;Echoes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spirals&lt;/em&gt; (though the latter is starting to grow on me). I think he has proved his point that he can write and produce, though  the first three tracks are head and shoulders above the others shows that he should probably be open to collaborations in future. I think the future is bright for him either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;young-knives-ornaments-from-the-silver-arcade&quot;&gt;Young Knives &lt;em&gt;Ornaments from the Silver Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of bands out there and no one is forcing you to listen to them all, no matter what record companies or music journalists might want you to think! It is understandable then that some bands go under the radar, while others get praised to high heaven and others still get savaged and pilloried. Sometimes critical and commercial indifference is down to sheer logistics and/or luck and not down to the quality of the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the case with Young Knives (AKA &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; Young Knives and I think it sounded better that way), a band that I really  like. &lt;em&gt;Ornaments From The Silver Arcade&lt;/em&gt; is their third album (worst title yet) and follows two strong previous efforts. As a band, they don’t really have a unique feature that makes them stand out from the crowd. The singer sounds quite posh but he’s so committed in his delivery that it can’t really be mocked and the band  is a tight three-piece that (for the most part) delivers some powerful post-punk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ornaments…&lt;/em&gt; is a little more mellow than &lt;em&gt;Of Animals And Men&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Superabundance&lt;/em&gt;, so it is a bit mundane by comparison. Nevertheless, it is good sunny day music for jumping around in the sunshine. Tracks like &lt;em&gt;Human Again&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Love My Name&lt;/em&gt; (video below) and &lt;em&gt;Go To Ground&lt;/em&gt; are well worth seeking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;katy-b-on-a-mission&quot;&gt;Katy B &lt;em&gt;On A Mission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katy B is a singer who has come through the Brits school (the second of two in this month’s posts, see Jamie Woon above) and had appeared on several underground hits before making her own record with some top dubstep producers. Given that one of the tracks that she appeared on has even made into to my collection, I guess it was inevitable that she would make her own album because things have to be pretty mainstream to reach me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure I would have bought this album if I still listened to the radio and had heard the singles. That is not to say that the singles (&lt;em&gt;Katy On A Mission&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lights Out&lt;/em&gt;) are bad&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, just that I would probably would have dismissed them as throwaway pop. While there is a lot of that on this album and some of it comes complete with cringeworthy dust-lust variety rhymes, there is also a lot to enjoy. This comes courtesy of the guest producers, though I am obviously so out of touch that I only recognise a few names in the booklet&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Why You Always Here&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Broken Record&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Easy Please Me&lt;/em&gt;. The latter sets its scene in a club with some sleaze latching on to our narrator who proceeds to reel off a list of demands for a potential amour, it’s an entertaining and empowering song with a nice elastic beat underpinning. Of all the stuff here, it is probably the most likely to make it to my playlists. In the end though, it is a pop album and it usually isn’t long before I move on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elbow-build-a-rocket-boys&quot;&gt;Elbow &lt;em&gt;Build A Rocket Boys!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha, the long-awaited Elbow album (in my house anyway). &lt;em&gt;The Seldom-Seen Kid&lt;/em&gt; was introduced to us with low expectations and rewarded repeat listens, thoroughly deserving its slow-burner status. The previous album &lt;em&gt;Leaders Of The Free World&lt;/em&gt; arrived to similar hype, following their excellent early albums and despite a strong start, faded into a suite of similar songs. A worrying precedent then for this album, which arrives as a sequel to an album that has, like those first two, built itself into the fabric of my life (and that of a lot of people, given the ubiquity of &lt;em&gt;One Day Like This&lt;/em&gt; at cup finals and weddings since).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It as well then that &lt;em&gt;Build a Rocket Boys!&lt;/em&gt; begins slowly with &lt;em&gt;The Birds&lt;/em&gt;, a song that now stands as Elbow’s longest and so naturally burdens it with comparisons to &lt;em&gt;Newborn&lt;/em&gt;, the glorious extended song-suite that was the tortured pulsating heart of &lt;em&gt;Asleep In The Back&lt;/em&gt;. Not only that but Elbow are masters of the opening track so &lt;em&gt;The Birds&lt;/em&gt; has to also stand alongside &lt;em&gt;Any Day Now&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ribcage&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Station Approach&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Starlings&lt;/em&gt;! The relief is that they managed it, I am not sure how they did it but they somehow amalgamated those songs into one - adding a touch of &lt;em&gt;Security&lt;/em&gt;-era Peter Gabriel in the process. It squirms and soars in equal measure over its eight minutes and Guy Garvey’s vocal detonates into an anthemic burst of sunshine at precisely the right point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this comes &lt;em&gt;Lippy Kids&lt;/em&gt;, which is the other album standout, a beautiful song with a strong kinship to &lt;em&gt;Scattered Black And Whites&lt;/em&gt; off &lt;em&gt;Asleep In The Back&lt;/em&gt; (perhaps that album was the start point for the songwriting here). It has a wonderful sense of nostalgia building on that realisation that not only is your childhood gone and locked in memory but that also no one else can relive that experience, no matter how much you might want them to. That refrain of “Nobody knew me at home” is a killer too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me about the rest of the album has been said in other reviews: many of the songs could sit nicely on Peter Gabriel’s mid-period solo work, I’m thinking &lt;em&gt;Peter Gabriel 3&lt;/em&gt; and the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Security&lt;/em&gt; here. These songs are punctuated with sweet near-acoustic numbers like &lt;em&gt;Jesus Was a Rochdale Girl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Night Will Always Win&lt;/em&gt; (a lovely little lament that falls over itself). However, irrespective of the arrangements and their historical touchstones, the over-riding qualities of these songs are the voice of Guy Garvey, an excellent band behind him that rarely intrudes and those aching lived-in lyrics. When all is said and done, &lt;em&gt;Build a Rocket Boys!&lt;/em&gt; is another solid album and if you shuffled up all the Elbow songs on iTunes you wouldn’t skip over a single one of them. “We’ve got open arms for broken hearts like yours my boy” indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fabric-57--agoria&quot;&gt;Fabric 57 : Agoria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to only mention the fabric mixes in passing each month, which is a shame because they often form a significant part of what I listen to, particularly when it’s a nice straight-up house/techno mix like this month’s one from Agoria. I had never heard of Agoria before listening to this mix and I still don’t know much. For example, my first google search brought up a Belgian technology company. They do seem to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/agoriagoria&quot;&gt;a MySpace&lt;/a&gt; so I guess that works as a starting point to learning a bit more about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mix itself is really good, probably the most enjoyable Fabric mix since the one by Surgeon (though I did find the Shackleton one very admirable technically) and definitely one to keep coming back to. Whereas Surgeon delivered (I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-september-2010/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) a hypnotic full-on pound-the-dancefloor mix, this one by Agoria is a different beast altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at the track list shows the difference, there are lots of double and triple tracks&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the there is also the credit to tracks that “feature throughout the mix”. The result is a relentless (but at points gentle) mix that layers on bits and pieces, sometimes doubling back on itself and revisiting various vocal loops. It helps that there are a lot of vocal tracks, in these mixes the vocals can sometimes disappear for large sections and more often than not leave you mired in repetitive and boring beats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed by this mix and I particularly liked the fact that they ended with a classic Ella Fitzgerald track. This was a classy touch and it sent me off to look for some of her songs online. I even found a version of “Ten Cents A Dance”, a song I have grown to love due to it being heavily featured in Bioshock 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I heard &lt;em&gt;Lights On&lt;/em&gt;, I realised I had heard it before. I’d seen on a music channel that my housemate had on one afternoon, my typically gruff response was “This is sh*t!”. Either I am becoming a reactionary jerk or I am starting to reject all music that hasn’t been through my own headphones. Or both. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Speaking of the booklet, there is an unintentionally hilarious minute or two at the end of &lt;em&gt;Hard To Get&lt;/em&gt; involving the shout-outs and such. This is actually quite sweet but the same words are in the booklet and so I got the sensation of pop album suddenly morphing into an audiobook! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By this I mean tracks that comprised two or three tracks that are either segued or mashed-up. They often sound great but are the bane of MP3 taggers everywhere! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I Love Betty Blue</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/why-i-love-betty-blue"/>
   <updated>2011-04-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/why-i-love-betty-blue</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090563/&quot;&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/a&gt; (original French title &lt;em&gt;37,2 Le Matin&lt;/em&gt;) for the first time in 1996 shortly after having read the book and it remains one of my favourite films to this day. Although there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1427&amp;amp;bih=1022&amp;amp;q=b%C3%A9atrice+dalle+betty+blue&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;uss=1&quot;&gt;many obvious reasons why&lt;/a&gt; a sixteen year old boy might like it, I think it does stand up to scrutiny beyond the sex and nudity. This post is a brief explanation of some of the obvious and not-so-obvious reasons why this is a film to be loved and cherished. (It was quite interesting to write this defence of a sexy film!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, it tells the story of Zorg (who narrates) and Betty, who have as the film starts known each other “for about a week”. The film follows events as their relationship develops and dark secrets from the past begin to emerge into their lives. Betty discovers Zorg’s novel and endeavours to get it published, while their adventures take them to Paris and then out to a piano shop in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that &lt;strong&gt;spoilers now follow&lt;/strong&gt; (if the previous paragraph wasn’t enough of a spoiler!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the first reason I love Betty Blue &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the obvious reason. Béatrice Dalle is a very sexy lady and as Betty, she continues to have the same effect on me fifteen years on. There is a lot of sex and nudity. It strikes me as very realistic and there are none of the coy “top half” shots you might expect from a Hollywood movie. The opening shot is a tour de force continuous take of “are they / aren’t they?” love-making and the cut to a euphoric Zorg rushing home to save his chili con carne&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later such scenes are not as intense, mirroring the developing relationship between Betty and Zorg and the role that sex plays as the mood darkens. Despite the film’s English title, not all of the sexy action revolves around the central character. In fact one of the last erotic scenes of the film is where Zorg robs a bank dressed as a woman&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it does not feature her at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear to me that Betty Blue is a sexy film rather than a sex film, its emphasis on female sexuality is not exploitative and not all the sexy scenes are explicit or involve Betty (see aforementioned robbery scene and also when Betty’s friend Lisa returns home after a night out to find Zorg at the kitchen table writing). Nor do the more explicit scenes focus solely on presenting unattainable unrealistic love-making, there are scenes confronting tiredness and another character Annie confides in Zorg about her husband’s loss of libido since she gave birth. I think all the sex is tackled maturely and the only sleazy character in the film is taken against in a tremendous scene where you will uncomfortable if you side with the sleaze and get titillated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already referred to “hilarious” scenes as I write and this is another reason why I love this film, there are a lot of incredibly funny moments. Perhaps the funniest is a scene (restored to the director’s cut on the DVD) in which a bin man with a hook for a hand savages a mattress left out on the street for collection. His colleague relates to Zorg that the man lost his hand as a result of feeding a similar mattress into a refuse truck and this lends the scene a little pathos, but the sight of the man hysterically (in both senses of the word) hacking away at the mattress in the background as this explanation is given makes for a perfectly bittersweet moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the biggest laughs throughout are generally bittersweet. Another example is the scene immediately after Eddy has been informed that his mother has died - there is an instant cut to Lisa helping him to tie a tie with a naked lady on it. The conclusion we are invited to come to is that this is the only black tie that he has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the film is very warm and genuine. It is, after all, a story of love and friendship. The tie scene immediately follows one where Zorg, Betty, Lisa and Eddy spend the evening getting drunk on tequila. The sense of friendship and community shines through both here and in the village where Betty and Zorg end up selling pianos in the shop Eddy inherits from his deceased mother. In a sense, these warm and cosy scenes serve to highlight the darkness and despair of Betty’s condition when it interjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere of the film is built up with great camera work and mysterious music. The shots are not just of sultry bedrooms where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_lisa&quot;&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/a&gt; smiles enigmatically on new lovers but also of the French countryside, of trains and their tracks, of sunsets and seaside. Sometimes the music feels a little like the wonky music we have come to expect in arty films that “mean something” (personally I would not want to own the soundtrack and listen to the music without the visuals) but most of the time it fits beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cinematic terms then, it is an aesthetically pleasing film and not just due to the skin on show. Personally I view this as an iconic piece of cinema, you can understand its scenes and remember them as a shorthand for the emotions they convey - just as you can with other great movies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/&quot;&gt;Metropolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050976/&quot;&gt;The Seventh Seal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/&quot;&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/a&gt;. For me, Betty Blue bears comparison with those films even if it may be because I was an impressionable teenager when I first saw it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would defend Betty Blue from accusations of being too overtly sexy (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19861225/REVIEWS/612250301/1023&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;). I would perhaps prefer a better “translation” of the original French title, as the English one does sound like it was suggested by someone from marketing with hairy palms and sweat issues. I don’t really think of it as a blue movie. I think it is a grown up film that deals with difficult subject matter (love, infertility, death, mental illness) in a very direct and engaging way. It confronts the difficult and dark aspects while reassuring us that there is comfort to be had in our time together with those we love, even though that time may be short. The ending is not a happy one but it is one that will you cause to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;further-information&quot;&gt;Further information:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a yet &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; French film starring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684500/&quot;&gt;Dominique Pinon&lt;/a&gt;! I swear the guy crops up in every French movie that I watch - and Alien Resurrection!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an interesting blog post about the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenbullets.com/blog/?p=87&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The book was given to me by my English teacher after I’d tried to loan her my copy of Iain M. Banks’ &lt;em&gt;Player of Games&lt;/em&gt;. I think she had decided to try to make me think about girls rather than spaceships. Or something. Actually the novel is kind of beatnik and she had previously fuelled my interest in the beat poets - I still have the photocopy of &lt;em&gt;Howl&lt;/em&gt; that she gave me. I have a feeling that she didn’t want &lt;em&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/em&gt; back but I returned it to her anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the English wikipedia article about the book’s author, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Djian&quot;&gt;Philippe Djian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why I have always assumed it is chili con carne, perhaps it is because it is about the only thing I would cook slowly on the hob like that, cookery naif that I am. Somehow if it were simply a lamb stew or a spag bol, it would seem too boring to drive home at such a speed for! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this comically convincing disguise is used again in a tragic scene towards the end of the film. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five Things To Try When You Can't Sleep</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep"/>
   <updated>2011-04-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Facebook is wonderful for keeping in touch but I’ve noticed that quite a few of my friends tend to use it to tell the world that they can’t sleep. Here’s some advice for you if you find yourself unable to sleep one night. I’ve often had to try these out myself! Note that these are just things that work for me and your mileage may vary, particularly if you are fortunate enough to have a partner next to you! You may need to appease them if you wriggle around too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan to be awake for a reasonable time yet.&lt;/strong&gt; This may seem like a stupid and defeatist “thing to do” and certainly not the sort of thing to put as number one on the list. Think about it though, there will be a reason why you are awake: you are worried about something, or are excited about something, you have indigestion, or you otherwise have some sort of reason why you are not headed to the land of nod. You are going to have to distract yourself, tire yourself or prove to yourself in some other way that you really need to sleep. As with anything, it is best to put in the hours if you are serious. If you are sleeping with a partner, extricate yourself and head somewhere comfortable where you won’t disturb them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to some music you know really well.&lt;/strong&gt; This is usually my first resort because then I can turn the light back off. By “some music you know really well” I mean something that you have loved for ages and you know inside out, so that you can predict the words or chords or samples or beats that are coming next. Sometimes you can just kick back and be asleep again before you know it. Meanwhile, if your playlist choice is something you really enjoy, you can at least make being kept awake a little nicer for yourself. Of course, this doesn’t really work if you have a partner who might be disturbed by noise leakage or who expects details next morning of what they talked about in their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do a jigsaw puzzle.&lt;/strong&gt; I must admit that I have never done this but I have boosted it up the list a bit because I certainly intend to do it in future. I even rescued a jigsaw from my parents’ house in order to have one at hand! The idea is that the simple problem solving activity will relax and tire you in equal measure and leave you ready to sleep after a little while. Of course, you should heed the piece of advice from higher up the list and prepare to take a little while over it. That said, it shouldn’t be too taxing. If it’s too cold or there’s some other reason you can’t get out of bed (those first sleepless nights with your leg in a cast for example), you could &lt;strong&gt;try to do a reasonably hard su doku&lt;/strong&gt; as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab a pen and paper and work out what is bothering you.&lt;/strong&gt; The reason this isn’t higher up the list is that I used to do this a lot and it can help sometimes if you haven’t had a wide awake night in quite a while. However, there are only so many times you can write out lists of things that trouble you or intricately planned out itineraries for the day ahead. That said, if you are going to write a list of things that bother you, it doesn’t matter what time of day it is, you are going to need to come up with solutions to the problems that you identify. Well, you are if you want to get some sleep anyway. The solutions you come up with don’t have to be the ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything, just some point of movement that you can make tomorrow. If you’re stuck on something at work, think of who you will ask for help and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, sometimes you can just be too worried about there not being time to do things when the morning comes. In this situation it is probably best to make a plan for how the morning will go, just something between best and worse case scenario, just so that you can convince yourself that it can be done. I can sometimes feel overwhelmed by the number of things that have to be done so I find that a mental run through is of great use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, even if you are not worried, excited or overwhelmed, the pen and paper can be a great ally. Perhaps there are just thoughts worming in and out of your head and you just need to do something other than lie there, perhaps the jigsaw, the iPod and the su doku are not an option. Then doodling and sketching and outlining imagined pieces of dialogue are a great way to settle yourself down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get up and eat something.&lt;/strong&gt; You heard me. And this is no time for rabbit food either, get going on that comfort food. My preference is for toast with lashings of butter and honey, though something simple like a raspberry yogurt is also good on a hot night. I also find that instant coffee sometimes works if you want to try out-psyching the body that is determined to keep you awake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Favourite Culture Ship Names</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/favourite-culture-ship-names"/>
   <updated>2011-04-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/favourite-culture-ship-names</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before &lt;a href=&quot;more-books&quot;&gt;I am re-reading the novels of Iain Banks&lt;/a&gt; and this weekend I managed to finish &lt;em&gt;Consider Phlebas&lt;/em&gt;. A little post about it will be coming up soon. One of my favourite things about the Culture novels is how the ships are named and having found &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ships_(The_Culture)&quot;&gt;a list on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I would share ten of my favourites with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll Clean That Up Before You Leave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ravished By The Sheer Implausibility Of That Last Statement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Through With This Niceness And Negotiation Stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prosthetic Conscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of Course I Still Love You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Size Isn’t Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hand Me The Gun And Ask Me Again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dramatic Exit, Or, Thank you And Goodnight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Haven’t Met But You’re A Great Fan Of Mine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anticipation Of A New Lover’s Arrival, The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great names all I am sure you would agree. Not all of them appear as fully developed characters. In fact (and I will mention this again later) the ships don’t get nearly enough time as characters in the novels apart from &lt;em&gt;Excession&lt;/em&gt;, which is almost entirely devoted to them. In that novel, one ship is central to the story and is probably my favourite, an eccentric GCU (General Contact Unit) called &lt;em&gt;Grey Area&lt;/em&gt; that has been shunned by the other machines for “non-consensual mind reading”. It turns out the ship is somewhat morbid and likes to confront the perpetrators of genocides with their crimes. It is known by the other ships as “the meatf***er” and is totally badass.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, March 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/this-is-not-an-album-digest-march-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-03-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/this-is-not-an-album-digest-march-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-is-not-an-album-digest-march-2011&quot;&gt;This is not an Album Digest March 2011&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well as I said at the end of &lt;a href=&quot;/album-digest-february-2011/&quot;&gt;last month’s album digest post&lt;/a&gt;, I took a bit of a break from pursuing new music quite as closely as I have been. As promised, I sidestepped the new R.E.M. and Elbow albums - although I had been promised the latter as a birthday present it is yet to show up, maybe I will look at in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, I’d intended to dig into the more obscure albums that have been recommended in recent months but it turns out that try to respond to music just because it has been well received critically is actually quite difficult. I often wonder if I just like albums because I am told to but I think this month’s experiments have proved that you do have to do a bit of research and think through your emotional responses to stuff, particularly if you have not heard anything before in that genre or by that artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things began well actually. The fabric release was &lt;strong&gt;Ramadanman&lt;/strong&gt;’s contribution to the Fabriclive series and was suitably moody stuff. I’d heard his remix of &lt;em&gt;Night Air&lt;/em&gt; by Jamie Woon (whose debut album has been pre-ordered for months chez mattischrome and will definitely be featured in next month’s update) and there were tracks by Burial and MJ Cole so some parts of had a fairly familiar sound. It was probably the most enjoyable installment since David Rodigan’s back in November last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was a pretty good month for electronic music as the first artist album I tried to catch up with was &lt;em&gt;Complex Housing&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Salva&lt;/strong&gt;, which was released back in February.  It is quite a surprising album in that the tracks are nice and short, everything is quite concise and nothing sticks around too long. It also flits between genres in quite a refreshing way, which is good because sometimes genre albums can be a little intimidating. For me the standout tracks are &lt;em&gt;Wake Ups&lt;/em&gt; - a beautifully frenetic piece with some awesome little sampled vocal stabs, &lt;em&gt;Baroque&lt;/em&gt; - more overtly dubstep (I guess) but with a pleasing techno feel, and a really good 2011 reworking of Robert Owens’ classic &lt;em&gt;I’ll be your friend&lt;/em&gt;, probably the best way to introduce old codgers like me to a new sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came &lt;em&gt;Space Is Only Noise&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Nicolas Jaar&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Magic Place&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Julianna Barwick&lt;/strong&gt;, two highly praised albums in which nothing much seems to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Nicolas Jaar album, I was hoping for something sleek and minimal like the albums I have loved recently by Gui Boratto, Anja Schneider, Mark Hemmann and Pantha Du Prince. Instead, I got wonky non-music somewhere between Matthew Herbert (who is often quite good) and Four Tet on the worst off day since Emperor Nero decided to do a bit of violin practice. I have a feeling that given enough time I might really like it but right now it just sounds like it is concentration music for ultra-pretentious gits (as I said, I might like it &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt;). Opener &lt;em&gt;Etre&lt;/em&gt; scratches around for an idea amid wonky jazz piano and found sound of children playing. Admittedly things improve for &lt;em&gt;Colomb&lt;/em&gt;, which is probably the best thing here - a sort of scratchy, bassy meditation with delicate vocoder vocals that builds very nicely. Elsewhere though, the jazzy inflections, found sounds and the sparse clicky instrumentation just left me cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar problem affects the album by Julianna Barwick - each track individually is very compelling to listen to, especially when cranked up loud, but collectively they sound a bit samey and don’t really provide a coherent whole. She clearly has a wonderful voice, which is layered and looped to magnificent effect over lush almost church-like instrumentation - see &lt;em&gt;White Flag&lt;/em&gt; for an example. Once the novelty wears off though the songs become annoyingly similar - on the first listen I was convinced that it was some postmodern joke and that all the songs were in fact the same. They aren’t, you can actually tell them apart but here is a very real case of homogeneity not working in an album’s favour. (Actually, listening back to some of this album as I write this post it is very good - I have definitely been a bit harsh and impatient, it is certainly very good in small doses!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All told then, I did not spend a lot of time listening to new music this month. I got reacquainted with some older material instead, including &lt;em&gt;Odd Blood&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Yeasayer&lt;/strong&gt; (mostly for &lt;em&gt;Ambling Alp&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;O.N.E.&lt;/em&gt;, which is on the FIFA 11 soundtrack), &lt;em&gt;This Is Happening&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;LCD Soundsystem&lt;/strong&gt; (bought a year ago and not listened to nearly enough) and &lt;em&gt;Tales From Turnpike House&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Saint Etienne&lt;/strong&gt; (seminal London band produce great concept album about a tower block).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month, &lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Woon&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ravedeath, 1972&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Tim Hecker&lt;/strong&gt; and (if it arrives) &lt;em&gt;Build A Rocket Boys!&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Elbow&lt;/strong&gt;. Beyond that we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;never-mind-the-ballards&quot;&gt;Never mind the Ballards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been writing about books by &lt;a href=&quot;j-g-ballard&quot;&gt;J.G. Ballard&lt;/a&gt; pretty much to the exclusion of all others. Gradually the posts have tricked out about four novels and ground to a halt. I’ve got a fair way through two other books but I am getting very tired of reading his novels all the time, much as I love them. The mistake I made was that I hadn’t read enough of them in the first place. The project for the site was get the books, read them and then write something. In terms of writing regular posts, this was a bad idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the remainder of my stuff out of my parents’ place recently has presented me with the oppurtunity to write another series of posts based on books that I have already read and loved. I’ve been reacquainted with the remainder of my beloved Iain M. Banks novels, which I read voraciously between the ages of 15 and 21. I still pick up the odd one now and then, the most recent being &lt;em&gt;Matter&lt;/em&gt;. I am also looking forward to reading &lt;em&gt;Surface Detail&lt;/em&gt; once it is out in paperback (I’m really not a fan of either hardbacks or of reading fiction on the Kindle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pretty much have all the science fiction novels apart from &lt;em&gt;Inversions&lt;/em&gt;, which I need to get a copy of in paperback. Those who have read them will know that they can pretty much be divided into the eight that feature the Culture - a society of technologically advanced atheist pleasure seekers - and those that don’t (&lt;em&gt;Against A Dark Background&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Feersum Endjinn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Algebraist&lt;/em&gt;). Dividing the Culture novels up into two chunks according to when they were written also provides a good indication of when their themes and timbre begin to change. This gives me three posts to write over the next few months based on books that I can gently re-read in the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-upcoming-posts&quot;&gt;Three upcoming posts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier Culture novels are probably the most removed from my memory apart from &lt;em&gt;The Player Of Games&lt;/em&gt;, which has stayed with me ever since I read it. (In fact, since I re-read it because it was the second time that its horrors began to trouble me, more of which later…) However, it shouldn’t take me too long to revisit them, especially as I am already most of the way through &lt;em&gt;Use Of Weapons&lt;/em&gt; (another horrifying tale but one that you truly glory in the gothic ramifications of rather than be shocked by) and I re-purchased and read &lt;em&gt;Excession&lt;/em&gt; very recently. Expect a post about these three and the humongous opening novel of the Culture sequence &lt;em&gt;Consider Phlebas&lt;/em&gt; in short order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the post on the later Culture novels may involve me reading and then writing about the newest novel &lt;em&gt;Surface Detail&lt;/em&gt;, I’ll make my second post about the mid-sequence non-Culture novels. In some ways all Banks’ science fiction references the Culture in some way and so these three books will lend themselves to discussion in context of the others despite their stand alone stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks in fact plays with this notion that the Culture is all pervasive in his work with “Inversions”, which is a Culture novel only because of the presence of the odd capitalised word and a knife missile. This sets the tone for the remaining novels, even if they are more explicit about the trappings of the Culture universe. Much of the fun comes from the Culture’s interventions on other worlds and the description of non-Culture societies - the later novels have to have this focus because the Culture always wins and so the stories require an outsider perspective in order to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so I have covered a fair bit of ground here. I hope I haven’t got too far ahead of myself and look forward to posting some deeper thoughts later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-note-on-spoilers&quot;&gt;A note on spoilers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of a final warning, &lt;strong&gt;the upcoming posts will feature plot spoilers&lt;/strong&gt; so beware of that. I will try to be responsible and not mention any spoilers until after the more tag of the next post (so you won’t see spoilers on the home page) but beyond that it will be your decision! If you interested in getting involved with the debate and reading ahead, the four novels of the first post will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Consider-Phlebas-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/1857231384/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consider Phlebas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Player-Games-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/1857231465/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Player Of Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Use-Weapons-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/185723135X/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use Of Weapons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Excession-Iain-M-Banks/dp/185723457X/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excession&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The post itself should appear in mid-to-late April.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #8: Second Light by Dreadzone</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-08"/>
   <updated>2011-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-08</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;understated-classics&quot;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; series, I try to alternate between pop/rock and electronic albums. Keeping with this trend number eight is the wonderful dub-infused album &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreadzone.com&quot;&gt;Dreadzone&lt;/a&gt;. Released in 1996 it was well-received critically and four of its tracks featured on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/&quot;&gt;John Peel&lt;/a&gt;’s best-of-year list that year. &lt;em&gt;Little Britain&lt;/em&gt; received a lot of radio play, a popular choice for that flag-waving period of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mojo4music.com/13834/the-story-of-britpop-in-60-albums/&quot;&gt;britpop&lt;/a&gt; and assorted other demons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strengths of &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; as an album is the anglicana&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of its first half and the subversion of it in the second half. I often talk of how albums are front-loaded with the best tracks to get you immersed in them. This is probably a hangover from vinyl where you could repeatedly play one side, making it necessary to make cohesive ‘sides’ of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having two distinct sides &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; is a coherent album. It starts with the gentle dub rumbler &lt;em&gt;Life, Love &amp;amp; Unity&lt;/em&gt;. The first sample you hear sets the tone: it’s from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monty_python_and_the_holy_grail/&quot;&gt;Monty Python &amp;amp; The Holy Grail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There’s a lovely wash of it and other samples (“The family that prays together, stays together”) as the track gets under way. This signifies the Englishness and cheekiness of what is to follow, while at the same time introducing a rumbling dub reggae beat. The album is filigreed with interesting samples and dialogue&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; akin to the best work of The Orb&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There aren’t many lyrical passages from the band itself, especially compared to later albums, there’s no more on the album until &lt;em&gt;Zion Youth&lt;/em&gt; over halfway in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes a wonderful trilogy of (mostly) instrumental tracks &lt;em&gt;Little Britain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Canterbury Tale&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Captain Dread&lt;/em&gt;. The first and the third of these use pastoral riffs and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel_(dance)&quot;&gt;reels&lt;/a&gt; to produce energetic dance music that intersects neatly with the folk heritage it seeks to appropriate. &lt;em&gt;A Canterbury Tale&lt;/em&gt; acts as a beautiful interlude between the two more upbeat tracks. It evolves slowly in a shimmer of sunshine and gorgeous choral vocals that may or may not be sampled from a more famous classical piece. It is probably my favourite track on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main feature of Dreadzone’s music is the dub reggae sound and obviously that does not feature as much on &lt;em&gt;Little Britain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Canterbury Tale&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Captain Dread&lt;/em&gt;. We start to go deeper into dub in the next few tracks. The bassline of &lt;em&gt;Captain Dread&lt;/em&gt; gives out into the burbling atmospherics of &lt;em&gt;Cave Of Angels&lt;/em&gt;, using some unknown movie dialogue (“In the cave we must be very careful not to offend the gods”) and a vocal sample that drives us underground toward subterranean levels of bass. As such we get closer to the dub sound but maintain the connection to England, in the form of a vision question to a mystic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatmystery.org/GMEmail/albionarthur.html&quot;&gt;Arthurian Albion&lt;/a&gt; - home of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur&quot;&gt;Excalibur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/mythical/grail.html&quot;&gt;the Holy Grail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then from &lt;em&gt;Zion Youth&lt;/em&gt; onward, anything goes. If by ‘anything’ you mean dub-centric house tunes. It has catchy vocals, actually the only other proper vocals by members of the group on the album after &lt;em&gt;Life, Love &amp;amp; Unity&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Zion Youth&lt;/em&gt; was also released as a single and there is a cracking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.underworldlive.com&quot;&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt; remix about. It is one of the mixes in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/darren-emerson&quot;&gt;Darren Emerson&lt;/a&gt; had more input; it dispenses with the reggae lilt and replaces it with some steely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=progressive%20house&quot;&gt;progressive house&lt;/a&gt;. There are enough references to the original to make it work brilliantly&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the second best track on the album is &lt;em&gt;One Way&lt;/em&gt; and it is almost the opposite of &lt;em&gt;A Canterbury Tale&lt;/em&gt;. It’s still pretty laid back but is much more fluid and dispenses with vocal samples altogether. Meanwhile, a wonderful bass line lopes up along with what sound like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/303.php&quot;&gt;303s&lt;/a&gt;, and it builds into something that you can’t help but dance to. I fear for my neighbours each time that I have it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shining Path&lt;/em&gt; revisits the &lt;em&gt;Cave Of Angels&lt;/em&gt; territory, another laid back eastern-influenced track with chimes and flutes. It’s pinned together with what sounds like samples from a self-hypnosis tape. It is the track I was listening to when I took a picture of the sun while walking home from work - one of those moments where the music you are listening to and the world around you combine to produce a transcendent moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close the album, &lt;em&gt;Out Of Heaven&lt;/em&gt; surfs down on a piano riff and a gentle bassline brings everything back to earth. The bass gets more strident in the middle but the track is all downtempo. Delicate female vocals and male choirs echo around, synths burble, and slowed down disco strings strut their stuff. A disembodied voice occasionally repeats “Maybe I was lucky that way”. It’s beautiful and makes me think of what it must be like walking along the sea shore staring at the full moon on a balmy summer night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fantastic album proves a number of things. First, John Peel really knew his stuff. Second, if there is such a thing as a ‘difficult second album’ (&lt;a href=&quot;uc5&quot;&gt;I have discussed this before&lt;/a&gt;) then this is one of those exceptions that proves the rule. Third, it is possible to make a dance album with long tracks that doesn’t feel like a grueling experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, Dreadzone never again made as complete an album as this one. There have been some stand-out tracks though: &lt;em&gt;Earth Angel&lt;/em&gt; from their next album &lt;em&gt;Biological Radio&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;American Dread&lt;/em&gt; from their most recent album &lt;em&gt;Eye On The Horizon&lt;/em&gt; spring to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Think of ‘Americana’ but English, anything that evokes bowling greens, radiant sunshine, birdsong and church spires. Though if you google it, you’ll find that Anglicana is the spanish word for Anglican. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The chorus of “Hello!” from the girls that torment Sir Galahad the Pure while he is held prisoner at Castle Anthrax. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the use of interesting dialogue and sound effects in electronic music is decreasing. This is mostly due to clearance issues and large media companies attempting using cleared samples as a new form of income. (In realistic language, the owners of samples are money grabbing gits!) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me personally may be wondering why there is no album by The Orb in this series. Please be assured that one is coming. The difficulty is deciding which album to choose and then whether it was suitably understated for this series. In the end, the resulting article may be a bit &lt;a href=&quot;/uc6/&quot;&gt;UC6 and The Shamen&lt;/a&gt;, where I also wote more generally about the rest of their back catalogue as well the album in question. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As another spoiler for things to come, search youtube for the Underworld mix of &lt;em&gt;Zion Youth&lt;/em&gt; and then compare it to the &lt;em&gt;Carp dreams… Koi&lt;/em&gt; remix of their own track &lt;em&gt;Pearl’s Girl&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, February 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-february-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;February, the shortest month, harbinger of such delights as Groundhog Day and Valentine’s Day. Could it possibly produce any good albums? Well the candidates are the eponymous début album by &lt;strong&gt;James Blake&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Zonoscope&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Cut/Copy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Let England Shake&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;PJ Harvey&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smart Flesh&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;The Low Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, there was an unexpected bonus when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiohead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced that their new album would be out and available to listen to this month too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got your ears on? Let’s go…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-of-the-month-james-blake-by-james-blake&quot;&gt;Album of the month: &lt;em&gt;James Blake&lt;/em&gt; by James Blake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, when I closed the January digest with a desire to listen to more dance music this month, I ordered the debut album by James Blake expecting that it would sate my desire for some more electronics this month. I did this based on some reviews of his EPs that I hadn’t had time to track down. I was in no way expecting such an experimental and spacious album, nor one that was so vocally centred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really quite gorgeous. Even after many many listens it is still surprising and amazing. It is really great when you get hold of an album that is accomplished and experimental in equal measure. It takes such twists and turns, and yet also manages to also be centred on either the space around your speakers or the space between your ears. Some of it - &lt;em&gt;I Never Learned To Share&lt;/em&gt; - goes a little bit too far but it is a small price to pay for tracks like &lt;em&gt;The Wilhelm Scream&lt;/em&gt; (song of the year so far for me), &lt;em&gt;Lindisfarne II&lt;/em&gt; and his excellent cover of Feist’s &lt;em&gt;The Limit To Your Love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That cover is pretty much the centrepiece of the album. It is quite a clever idea to take a (relatively) well-known song and translate it to his style, providing a Rosetta stone to link his sound world and the one that we are more used to. The fact that he has managed to take an original that I would consider to be the epitome of sparse and then make it &lt;em&gt;sparser still&lt;/em&gt; is a complete triumph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few listens, I did wonder whether I would perhaps end up forgetting about this album in a few months time, that it might be a flash in the pan and now a few weeks later I am still not one hundred percent sure. Nevertheless, even if it ends up being something derided as a pretentious ELO rip-off in years to come, it remains for now a thrilling and vital album, a grab-bag of ideas and trends that we might see in the best records of the months and years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;return-to-oz&quot;&gt;Return to Oz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From New Zealand’s The Phoenix Foundation last month to Australian’s &lt;strong&gt;Cut/Copy&lt;/strong&gt; this month. These guys released the highly acclaimed album &lt;em&gt;In Ghost Colours&lt;/em&gt; back in March/April 2008, it was on heavy rotation as I finished writing up my PhD thesis. This is a lesser work in my opinion and hasn’t made quite as much of an impression on me. Nevertheless it is an accomplished dancey-indie hybrid if you like that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particular tracks of note are the Klaxon-y &lt;em&gt;Pharaohs and Pyramids&lt;/em&gt;, a lovely little song called &lt;em&gt;Alyssa&lt;/em&gt; and the long and burbling closer &lt;em&gt;Sun God&lt;/em&gt;. However it is all very pleasant, sunny and Antipodean. This album was perhaps a more straightforward way to indulge me need for more electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-of-the-month-2-let-england-shake-by-pj-harvey&quot;&gt;Album of the Month 2: &lt;em&gt;Let England Shake&lt;/em&gt; by PJ Harvey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much was made of the fact that by awarding gongs to Laura Marlin, Mumford &amp;amp; Sons (“The Michael McIntyre of Folk” - Dave Quantick) and (to some extent) The Arcade Fire, the BRIT awards has gone some way to better acknowledging the importance of indie music. However, if the industry allows this album by PJ Harvey to slip into obscurity by next year then we will know that it is definitely an irrelevance. It is a truly amazing work of art that will definitely be among the best albums of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main triumph of &lt;em&gt;Let England Shake&lt;/em&gt; is its ability to tackle dark material head on and yet at the same time mould those themes into excellent songs that are a pleasure to listen to. In some respects this album is on a par with Tom Waits’ &lt;em&gt;Blood Money&lt;/em&gt; or Radiohead’s &lt;em&gt;Kid A&lt;/em&gt;, though she manages to trump both of these because her voice on this record is beautiful and certainly less divisive than that of either of the T(h)oms. Meanwhile, the subject matter of the album - the first world war and its effect on the very notion of England - is expertly handled. Unfortunately, we live in a time when “England” as a national identity has been hijacked by the far right and the Daily Mail (why am I even treating them as separate things?!) for nefarious purposes, this album takes a strong stride towards offering us an alternative to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other PJ Harvey album I own is &lt;em&gt;Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea&lt;/em&gt;, which won the Mercury Music Prize in 2001 - the announcement was rather snuck out on September 12 following the events of the day before. That album was a rather loose collection of songs (as its title suggests), it had some lovely songs including a rather sensuous duet with Thom Yorke and &lt;em&gt;No Exit&lt;/em&gt;, which was fabulously punky and was further evidence of the world having been enthused by the Strokes and The White Stripes. I have skipped a few records in between and now this seems like a quantum leap onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly acoustic and delivered with a totally different vocal style to STFCSTFS, these songs are really beautiful and they have a timeless quality about them that makes hope that they might be learned by people and played - despite the dark subject matter and elegiacal tone, they also have a campfire feel to them. After all, it is often therapeutic to make art out of terrible events, folk songs have been about this from pretty much day one. This is not to denigrate the songs with a sort of Kumbaya association but rather to say that these songs are successful in being elegiac rather morose (there is a difference!) because they celebrate the fallen as much as they mourn them - there are stories of friendships here as well as lives lost. Moreover, the presence of additional vocalists and the arrangement of her own vocals throughout are also suggestive of the fact that these songs should be sung in groups together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album stands as a coherent whole and I think the theme holds up throughout. If I had to pick the best songs I would say &lt;em&gt;Let England Shake&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Glorious Land&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Words That Maketh Murder&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Written On The Forehead&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Colour Of The Earth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oh-my-god-its-no-charlie-darwin&quot;&gt;Oh my God, it’s no Charlie Darwin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always remember the albums that come along just when you need them, even if you have no idea how they came into your possession. &lt;strong&gt;The Low Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;’s previous album &lt;em&gt;Oh My God Charlie Darwin&lt;/em&gt; happens to be one of those records, one that I came across (several months after its release) at just the point when I needed a mournful and reflective album to help me ponder my mistakes and choices. Its slightly upbeat undertones make it a very good album for being in a funk, mainly because it will help to lift you out of it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, its follow-up &lt;em&gt;Smart Flesh&lt;/em&gt; is an early candidate for the most disappointing album of the year. It has many problems, the chief of which is a plodding homogeneity throughout. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing. There are all manner of worthy adjectives and epithets that can be attached to homogeneity like “consistent”, “coherent” and “on form”. Unfortunately, the great strength of &lt;em&gt;Oh My God Charlie Darwin&lt;/em&gt; was its heterogeneity - it veered from tender ballads (&lt;em&gt;Charlie Darwin&lt;/em&gt;) to belters (&lt;em&gt;The Horizon is a Beltway&lt;/em&gt;) delivered in a Waits-esque growl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Smart Flesh&lt;/em&gt; though, the songs have almost all become dreary leaden ballads delivered in a reedy sub-Dylan drawl that may have got the singer laid but will fail to excite all but the most cretinous listener. Musically, there’s nothing of interest except the weird synth-y noises that underpin the title track; unfortunately the same track is undermined by lasting FOREVER (well 7 and a half of the longest minutes you will ever experience) and the addition of a lisp to that horrible faux Dylan voice (I’m not mocking speech affliction here, it sounds more like an artefact of amateurish production).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel cheated for having bought this record. It pales in comparison to something similar like &lt;em&gt;The King Is Dead&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;The Decemberists&lt;/strong&gt;. Avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Of course, if you’ve heard this album and love it, you can probably dismiss my comments as a result of my - hopefully temporary - deafness this month. I will be listening a couple more times just to see whether it does actually improve on repeat listens.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;valentines-day-surprise&quot;&gt;Valentine’s Day Surprise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Valentine’s Day, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/&quot;&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt; announced that they would be releasing their new album online at the end of that week - it ended up coming out a day early on the 18th and so a very happy Friday morning at work was spent trying to concentrate on programming while picking apart the new songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an album, it runs for 37 minutes and consists of 8 tracks. It seems that 37 minutes is the new 76 minutes, all but one of this month’s albums is under forty minutes. As CDs have got cheaper (or dispensed with altogether in Radiohead’s case), bands have stopped trying to fill them up with every last studio sketch and this is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The King of Limbs&lt;/em&gt; (named for a famous old tree) sounds like &lt;em&gt;In Rainbows&lt;/em&gt; in having that very loose spacious sound and relative ease with itself. Like &lt;em&gt;In Rainbows&lt;/em&gt; it is much more mellow than the preceeding four albums, that golden run from &lt;em&gt;OK Computer&lt;/em&gt; onward. However, this time the songs seem more immersed in the music. I found &lt;em&gt;In Rainbows&lt;/em&gt; to be quite spare in the main (think &lt;em&gt;15 Step&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;All I Need&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;House Of Cards&lt;/em&gt;) but here bits and pieces from the mix drift in and out, over and under the lyrics. It is much more impressionistic and so you have goosebumpy moments when the lyrics soar out over the music on &lt;em&gt;Lotus Flower&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Codex&lt;/em&gt;) but you get an equally shivery sensation when the vocals are sebaceous and hidden like on &lt;em&gt;Giving Up The Ghost&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The run of &lt;em&gt;Lotus Flower&lt;/em&gt; (be sure to check out the video!), &lt;em&gt;Codex&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Giving Up The Ghost&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Separator&lt;/em&gt; is probably their best sequence of tracks since the second side of &lt;em&gt;Kid A&lt;/em&gt; over a decade ago (though the fact that they messed up the track listing of &lt;em&gt;Hail To The Thief&lt;/em&gt; also has a lot to do with this!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, “world’s best band makes yet another lovely album” isn’t much of a story but I don’t care: now if I am having a terrible day I just have to put on that bit about three minutes into &lt;em&gt;Giving Up The Ghost&lt;/em&gt; that goes “In you arm” over and over and my day will be fixed. That is good enough news for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-digest-february-2011---summary&quot;&gt;Album Digest February 2011 - Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the Radiohead album was a pleasant surprise addition to this month’s collection. I think that as a result I had to write more reviews than I was intending for such a short month! Next month I will be avoiding the big releases by &lt;strong&gt;R.E.M.&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Elbow&lt;/strong&gt;, settling instead to play catch up with some recommended albums from January and February that I have managed to miss.&lt;/p&gt;

   <link href="http://localhost:4000/out-there-somewhere"/>
   <updated>2011-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/out-there-somewhere</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hurrah for more exoplanets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/feb/02/new-planets-solar-system&quot;&gt;making the news&lt;/a&gt; this week. This time it is a star with a whole bunch of small planets very close to the star, usually they tend to be single gas giants larger even than &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter&quot;&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; as this &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanetary_host_stars&quot;&gt;list of stars with exoplanets&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these stars are all so far away! The closest star with an exoplanet found in orbit around it so far is 10 light years away (Epsilon Eridani) and this week’s system was found over 2000 light years away. To put this in perspective, Voyager 2 is &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/Voyager2/status/32589239199731713&quot;&gt;currently 11 hours 13 minutes and 52 seconds of light travel from Earth&lt;/a&gt; just over 33 years after launch. It hasn’t really left our solar system yet - it is twice as far from the sun as Pluto but not as far as planet X - and according to current calculations it will next encounter a star (Sirius) in 290,000 years time, by which time it will be 8.6 light years from Earth and its instruments will be long dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we don’t tend to talk about stars that &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have planets orbiting them. I presume that we would know by now if our nearest stars like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solstation.com/stars/alp-cent3.htm&quot;&gt;Proxima Centauri&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glyphweb.com/esky/stars/alphacentauri.html&quot;&gt;Alpha Centauri&lt;/a&gt; definitely do not have stars orbiting them, so we definitely know that Epsilon Eridani is the star nearest to us with a planuc8et. It would be good to know that you definitely have to go that far to see more planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How on earth would you get there? You can’t travel faster than light and you can only send telemetry back fast as the speed of light so it is mostly the time that any such mission would take that ruins most notions of knowing anything about these planets any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our best hope lies with artificial intelligence applied to two different problem domains. One is the exploration of the known universe with a set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft&quot;&gt;Von Neumann probes&lt;/a&gt;. This is a device that replicates itself in order to complete its mission. It is quite a popular theme of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berserkerfan.org/&quot;&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt; to involve such devices as berserk swarms of robots intent on destroying all life but realistically if human endeavour is to amount to anything, the creation of these machines to explore the universe and to conduct the experiments using the data collected is our best bet at outlasting our rapidly dwindling natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If artificial life beamed out into space to replicate itself forever is a bit too weird to countenance, how about the use of artificial intelligence to perform and guide research right here on earth? At the moment machines cannot really play &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article2002699.ece&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; and can only really &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/&quot;&gt;beat humans at chess&lt;/a&gt; by being able to perform analysis of more future moves from each configuration of the board than his fleshbound opponent. However, life produces Chess Grandmasters and Go players so computer programs will eventually be able to too. Perhaps a philosopher, a computer science or a better mathematician than I would care to disagree. However, it is my belief that we will eventually be able to program our computers to make similar leaps of faith and connections between disparate elements as made by humans. At that point, ending the disconnect between the logic and the brute force work will greatly speed up many research processes. Some might feel that this is a monstrous relegation of humanity to the fringes of science but I personally believe that the removal of human bias and error will be of great benefit, not to mention the many discoveries that could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough of the speculative stuff for now. I think I might try and learn a bit more about astrophysics in the future, if I get any insights I will be sure to share them here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Programming an UNO game, part 2</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/programming-an-uno-game-part-2"/>
   <updated>2011-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/programming-an-uno-game-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It turns out that programming the UNO game is not that complicated once you start designing the thing. This post will get the rules and game elements clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-deck&quot;&gt;The deck&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An UNO deck consists of four sets of coloured cards (red, yellow, green and blue) together with eight wild cards. The non-wild cards are marked with either numbers or special symbols. The numbers range from zero to nine with two of each number except for the zero, which is unique. For each colour there are also two each of three kinds of special card: SKIP, SWAP and DRAW. The eight wild cards are divided into four each of two types: WILD and WILDFOUR. The wild cards are usually black in UNO decks so we may refer to them as black cards on occasion. There are one hundred and eight cards in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gameplay&quot;&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is recommended that there be between two and ten players. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt seven cards from the deck and a starting player selected. This selection can be done in a number of ways, a good way is for the players to cut the deck before dealing and to choose the person who turns up the highest value card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the deal, the remainder of the deck is set aside face down and the top card turned up and placed on the table in the middle of the circle created by the players. The starting player then attempts to match either the colour or number that is on this card. Note that if a special coloured card or a wild card is turned up initially, it is placed to the back of the deck and another chosen until a number card is revealed. For example, if a red seven is turned up then the first player can lay any red card or a seven of any colour. If she cannot do this but has a wild card, she can lay this instead - we will explain the wild cards in a moment. Failing that, she must pick up another card from the remainder of the deck. After any of these actions, the play moves on to the next player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play proceeds clockwise in this fashion with each player aiming to get rid of all their cards. When laying their penultimate card, a player must say “UNO!”. If they do not, then they may be required to take two cards from the deck if another player manages to say “UNO!” before the next player lays a card. A player cannot lay a special or wild card as their last card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scoring&quot;&gt;Scoring&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a player has successfully discarded all of their cards, they are declared the winner of the round and the values of the cards remaining in the hands of the other players are added to give that player’s score for the round (the winner scores zero). Numbers are taken at face value, special cards have a value of 20 and wild cards a value of 50. If over the course of several rounds a player’s score exceeds a pre-determined threshold (say 250) they are eliminated from future rounds and the ultimate winner of the game is the last person standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;behaviour-of-the-special-cards&quot;&gt;Behaviour of the special cards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SKIP card is usually marked with a “null” symbol. It causes the play to skip over the next player, who misses a turn. In two player games this card will have no effect so it can either be discarded or treated as a zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SWITCH card is usually marked with arrows. It causes the play to change direction from clockwise to anti-clockwise, or vice versa. In two player games this card will also have no effect so it can either be discarded or treated as a zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DRAW card is usually marked “+2” in some fashion. It forces the next player to draw two cards from the deck and miss their turn. There are unofficial rule variations in which the next player may not have to pick up a card and miss their turn (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WILD card is marked with an oval cut into four segments coloured red, yellow, green and blue. The player laying this card can nominate a new colour that subsequent players must lay. In addition the next player must pick up a card from the deck and miss their turn. As stated above, this can only be laid if there is no legal alternative. As with the DRAW card, there are unofficial variations in which the next player may not have to pick up a card and miss their turn (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WILDFOUR card also features all four colours and is usually marked with “+4” in some fashion. It allows the player laying the card to nominate a new colour for the deck. Meanwhile, the next player is forced to pick up four cards from the deck and miss their turn. Again, there are unofficial rule variation that may prevent a player from picking up additional cards (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unofficial-rule-variation&quot;&gt;Unofficial rule variation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some unofficial rule variations, in a situation where the next player is required to pick up cards as the result of a DRAW, WILD or WILDFOUR card being played, they do not have to do so if they themselves have a DRAW, WILD or WILDFOUR card. The player after them would then have to pick up the number of cards corresponding to the sum of the cards played. For example, a DRAW followed by a WILD would lead to the next player picking up three cards. This can continue with the number of cards that the subsequent player is required to pick up increasing accordingly. It is to be noted that a DRAW card cannot be played &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; either of the wild cards and a WILD card cannot be played &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; a WILDFOUR card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This variation is not consistent with the remainder of the rules though as it does not preserve the unique nature of the wild cards, which must be played only when there is no alternative - not to avoid picking up cards! Initially we will not include it in the program, though we may return to it later as a way of investigating how to create different gameplay options for the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moving-on-to-the-code&quot;&gt;Moving on to the code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for part three, where I will discuss how I program the game and will also give some screenshots of the console based version.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. G. Ballard, Crash</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/crash"/>
   <updated>2011-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/crash</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;form-and-function-deformation-and-dysfunction&quot;&gt;Form and function, deformation and dysfunction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we should get one thing out of the way first. For me, there is nothing erotic about a car or a motorway. The place in popular culture of the car in particular as sexual icon has always bemused me. In fact, I’m really rather ambivalent about cars. This matters when discussing &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;, the 1973 novel by JG Ballard that resumes this strand of posts about his novels. (You can read about &lt;em&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/the-drowned-world/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Drought&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/the-drought/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Crystal World&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/the-crystal-world/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genius of &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt; is that premise of people deriving sexual gratification from cars and car crashes. Anyone you talk to about it will give a response in between one of “oh that’s weird” and “oh that’s gross”. My own response was something like that too, a sort of morbid curiosity (it was the first Ballard novel that I read) and the true art of the novel is how the writing really draws you in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussion of &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt; much is made of how Ballard’s medical training supposedly contributes to the detached style in which events are recited and how this is done in very anatomical detail. It has to be said that Ballard also spent time as an erotic writer and it is the echoes of pornography that contribute more to the prose style in &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;. He knows precisely how to present his scenes so that the perverse and the terrifying become fascinating and engrossing, he understands how to transmit the sensation of sexual fascination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say most of this with a fourteen year remove from the direct sensation of reading it for the first time. That was a hot summer between my two years in sixth form college where all that seemed to exist was this novel and the hot sun. It was a guilty pleasure that I now feel the same way about as most people who have read &lt;em&gt;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&lt;/em&gt; and its sequels. &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt; grips you in a metallic vice of crushed automobile and takes advantage of you being trapped there, reciting its litany of sexual horrors while you are unable to look away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballard’s skill is to allow almost every aspect of the narrative to be infused with this moto-eroticism such as the descriptions of landscape: “the flyovers overlaid one another like copulating giants, immense legs straddling each other’s backs” (p. 59). It is a touch overwritten in places, sometimes things leap out and strike me as being a bit too wry for their own good and reading it now I found it harder to be convinced by the characters and their motives than when I was seventeen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I wasn’t really able to re-read it to write this post and that is why it has taken so long for me to get anything out of it to write about. I read isolated pieces from the book, some of which I remembered from the first time and some of which seemed unfamiliar. As an exercise in gauging the change in my responses over time it was certainly amusing and valuable, though I shall have to try again later with a novel that I will actually be able to read again in full. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;Hard-boiled Wonderland And The Edge Of The World&lt;/em&gt; by Haruki Murakami would be a good choice, I read it seven years ago while spending a week in bed having submitted my MSc dissertation and I still remember it fondly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two novels in the Ballard sequence will also be fairly tough, &lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a man marooned on a motorway intersection and &lt;em&gt;High Rise&lt;/em&gt; relates the descent into anarchy of the residents of a luxury tower block. Of course I shall have to persevere with reading these. I’ll begin with &lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt; as soon as I’ve dispatched &lt;em&gt;Kraken&lt;/em&gt; by China Mieville - expect a review of that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Album Digest, January 2011</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2011"/>
   <updated>2011-01-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/album-digest-january-2011</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s to 2011 and the start of a monthly album digest. I want it to be a brief trot through some of the albums I have listened to each month. Sometimes January can bring a few quiet releases by big name bands. This happens if the previous album did not do as well as the record company hoped or if it is the kind of artist who would get lost under the hype of all the Christmas releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two big releases this month were &lt;em&gt;The King Is Dead&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;The Decemberists&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kiss Each Other Clean&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Iron &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/strong&gt;. I guess you could count &lt;em&gt;Valhalla Dancehall&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;British Sea Power&lt;/strong&gt; as a fairly big release too. Beyond those three I have only really managed to listen to &lt;em&gt;The Deep Field&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Joan As Policewoman&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Buffalo&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;The Phoenix Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;, so the main meat of the digest consists of these five albums. I’d never heard anything by either of these last two bands before I bought them - a leap into the unknown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, there are also the Fabric mixes to consider. &lt;em&gt;FabricLive 55&lt;/em&gt; sees &lt;strong&gt;DJ Marky&lt;/strong&gt; deliver a kinetic drum-n-bass mix. I don’t tend to buy d-n-b but I do like it when one comes along in the Fabric series. It’s perfect for genre daytrippers like me, I thought it was pretty good and may even get some repeat listens when I fancy something frenetic. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Fabric 55&lt;/em&gt; was another of their occasional single artist affairs, this time by &lt;strong&gt;Shackleton&lt;/strong&gt;. I found it washed over me a little too easily, though there was a really spooky scripture-quoting track toward the end that I really liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to listen to the new &lt;strong&gt;White Lies&lt;/strong&gt; album &lt;em&gt;Ritual&lt;/em&gt; because it has been getting hilariously bad reviews (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://thequietus.com/articles/05510-white-lies-ritual-review&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) but I’ve given up on Spotify now as I was not using it enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you sitting comfortably? Are your musical antennae all a-twitch? Then let us begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-king-is-dead-long-live-the-kings&quot;&gt;The King Is Dead, long live the kings!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The received wisdom is that &lt;em&gt;Hazards of Love&lt;/em&gt;, the previous full length by The Decemberists was a little below their high standards. I think that might be a little harsh, I think it is more the case that an hour long concept album is not always the first thing you think of putting on when you come home from work. I think that you could say the same of their previous song suites such as &lt;em&gt;The Island&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The Crane Wife&lt;/em&gt; or the epic 18 minute single &lt;em&gt;The Tain&lt;/em&gt;. These are very easy to admire but hard to love, though if The Decemberists did not make these kinds of tunes it is likely that no one would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;em&gt;The King Is Dead&lt;/em&gt; plays into the hands of that received wisdom by being almost as much the opposite of “Hazards of Love” as any recognisable Decemberists album could be. It is often trite to compare an album to a hybrid of two or more classics but in this case imagining the love child of &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt; by R.E.M. and Bruce Springsteen’s &lt;em&gt;We Shall Overcome&lt;/em&gt; album of Bob Seeger covers will probably serve you well. The extra that the Decemberists bring to that combination is that modern sense of melody and even though the instrumentation is quite retro – all fiddles and banjos – the songs themselves feel modern and warm, which is what created their fanbase in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a real boon to get an album that makes you feel so happy in mid-January, almost certainly the most depressing time of the year. My favourites are the opener &lt;em&gt;Don’t Carry It All&lt;/em&gt; (imagine &lt;em&gt;Sons and Daughters&lt;/em&gt; for the following generation), the folky &lt;em&gt;Rox In The Box&lt;/em&gt; (haven’t we heard that tune somewhere before?) and the sweet yet melancholy &lt;em&gt;June Hymn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rusting-or-improving-with-age&quot;&gt;Rusting, or improving with age?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had heard that &lt;em&gt;Kiss Each Other Clean&lt;/em&gt; was quite an experimental album with Iron &amp;amp; Wine taking a new direction, so when I first listened to it I did what any geek would do and made notes. Looking back over those notes later having living with the album for a bit (i.e. having had it blared into my ears as I walked to and from work) most of the notes look rather alien to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that when I first sat down with the songs I was biased towards picking out the novelty: I was deliberately listening out for how different it would be and what the newer elements to the sound were. There were some strange things for sure, a few scratchy beats here and the odd saxophone there. Some tracks are awash with synthesizer and the vocal production is different too: the sound is much more pared back and there are less layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time wore on it struck me though how much the new songs are very much from the same lineage as older ones. This is probably a function of the fact that Iron &amp;amp; Wine have always done the essentials really well. These songs come from the same vein of good song writing, hook-laden melodies and a dedication to really get the most out of every song. That maximalism is really there on this record, to the point of allowing tracks like &lt;em&gt;Rabbit Will Run&lt;/em&gt; to first skate over a weird cavalcade of digitally processed flutes in the bridge and then slide into a coda consisting of a “jazz flute” that Ron Burgandy would be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, their knack for transforming the mundane to the magical (and vice versa) remains defiantly in place (&lt;em&gt;Me and Lazarus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tree By The River&lt;/em&gt;), along with a glorious inability (most of the time) to take things seriously. On &lt;em&gt;Your Fake Name Is Good Enough For Me&lt;/em&gt;, the big proggy closing track we get seven minutes that begin with a folksy lilt before churning into a dirge built around lyrics of the format “We will become / become the X and the -not X or sort of similar to X-“ where you can insert your own choices of X, examples are “the fruit and the fall”, “the bandage and the blade”. However, the final lines completely cut away from this cod philosophy: “we will become an ice cream cone” and then “a disco ball”. It’s a really nice change of tone, a winking aside to the listener seven minutes into the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite track is the opener &lt;em&gt;Walking Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;, which like &lt;em&gt;Your Fake Name…&lt;/em&gt; has a list based structure. It doesn’t last as long as the latter song and builds slowly on surreal imagery: “I saw sickness, blooming fruit trees / I saw blood and some of it was mine / I saw children in a river / But their lips were still dry”. I will let you find out where it builds to but it is very satisfying indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief then, another quality album from Iron &amp;amp; Wine, greatly enriched by the fact that they haven’t rested on their laurels and made something similar to previous albums. As I said about the Decemberists, it is really great to have bands that move on with their sounds and continue to push the envelope rather than just sticking to what made them popular. Personally I am now very excited about seeing I&amp;amp;W in March, obviously I will let you know how that goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thor-t-you-liked-rock-music&quot;&gt;Thor-t you liked rock music?!?!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth album by British Sea Power begins with &lt;em&gt;Who’s In Control?&lt;/em&gt;, a promising retread of the shoutier bits of previous album &lt;em&gt;Do you like rock music?&lt;/em&gt;. A song about protesting, it is very zeitgeist and is pretty much the spunkiest thing on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything has to be spunky of course and BSP do delicate as well as anyone. Here &lt;em&gt;Clearing Out The Rooms&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Once More Now&lt;/em&gt; (also the two longest tracks) fulfil these duties very well, both beautiful sweeps of soft vocals and washes of lush instrumentation - the former has a wonderfully longing string refrain throughout. There is also a nice bit of CAN style fuzziness halfway through in the shape of &lt;em&gt;Mongk II&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Valhalla Dancehall&lt;/em&gt; is a good album that sits well with their previous efforts and I think that just like with the previous albums it may take a while for some of the songs to work their way under my skin. Apart from those I have already mentioned, I think that &lt;em&gt;Georgie Ray&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Living Is So Easy&lt;/em&gt; probably stand a good chance of becoming well loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;Do you like rock music?&lt;/em&gt; is slightly more varied than the new one and I think it is unlikely to be usurped as my favourite BSP album. However, it is great to know that they remain as vital and interesting as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-the-mammal-you-adore&quot;&gt;I am the mammal you adore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Phoenix Foundation are big in New Zealand and are now making a belated bid to reach the UK and the states. &lt;em&gt;Buffalo&lt;/em&gt;, their fourth album was released last year in NZ and now makes it here on the same label as The Go! Team. The CD also comes bundled with a digital download of their second album &lt;em&gt;Pegasus&lt;/em&gt; so I shall say a few words about that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buffalo&lt;/em&gt; has ten tracks, which consist of two bona fide hits (&lt;em&gt;Buffalo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Orange &amp;amp; Mango&lt;/em&gt;) and eight growers. You can tell that they are a band who must be pretty tight live as the weaker tracks here are quite jam based and sometimes the lyrics can be a little weak when they aren’t really the focus of the song. There’s some really good stuff here though, the title track is gentle natured pulsating track that navigates its way to the dancefloor - a few tweaks could produce a monster of a remix. The opening track &lt;em&gt;Eventually&lt;/em&gt; has wonderful surf/Hawaiian vibe and shimmers in an an early morning erotic haze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general tone is very mellow, &lt;em&gt;Flock Of Hearts&lt;/em&gt; wanders around in a daze perhaps recalling a scene from &lt;em&gt;Alice In Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. The lead single &lt;em&gt;Pot&lt;/em&gt; again has a kind of luau sound with lyrics that don’t go anywhere, again perfect for a Sunday lie-in or a summer evening drive. In recent listens I have come to realise that &lt;em&gt;Bitte Bitte&lt;/em&gt; is probably the best song here, the singer’s voice sounds a bit like Ian Drury here and the chorus is a bitte of fun, being a pun (see what I did there). It glides by pretty effortlessly and makes me very curious about what an uptempo album by this band would sound like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an album wouldn’t sound like &lt;em&gt;Pegasus&lt;/em&gt;, their second album. It is also quite slow but much more stripped back than &lt;em&gt;Buffalo&lt;/em&gt;. I enjoyed it a lot and getting it for free was a really good deal, sometimes music you get for free is pretty poor but this was genuinely a bargain. I think I will go and see them live if they play in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-of-the-month-the-deep-field-by-joan-as-police-woman&quot;&gt;Album of the month: &lt;em&gt;The Deep Field&lt;/em&gt; by Joan As Police Woman&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to getting this CD from amazon, I had no idea what this would sound like at all. Joan As Police Woman is the name that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Wasser&quot;&gt;Joan Wasser&lt;/a&gt; gives to her recorded output, her biography is quite interesting but, as I now know, her music is even more so. After all, four songs into this album I knew it was the best thing I would hear this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that I am not exactly sure why. I think only one track really stands out in the sense that I can remember it after the CD has finished (that track, is &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt;, by the way). I guess it is because there is a whole stack of female vocalists that I love to listen to: Kate Bush, Bjork, Tracey Thorn, Feist et al, and this album is a pretty gorgeous fusion of those references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music throughout is very polished and smooth, in a luxurious rather than boring way. There are touches of what you might call a modern sound but it is mostly very traditional throughout, it’s not as experimental as &lt;em&gt;The Reminder&lt;/em&gt; by Feist - though that album’s more sedate moments are a good reference for &lt;em&gt;The Deep Field&lt;/em&gt;. In other places it goes pretty easy listening, &lt;em&gt;Kiss The Specifics&lt;/em&gt; sounds like it could sit very nice on Norah Jones’ first album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I think I like the album so much because it does sound a lot like Prince; &lt;em&gt;Chemmie&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant example of this, aided by soft cooing backing vocals and lyrics about “an untamed animal attraction” and having “reached the eighth dimension”. Basically a funky arrangement and some kooky lyrics is always going to win you a Prince comparison in my book. Elsewhere on the track, she sounds a lot like Kate Bush - someone who is no stranger to this sound, having collaborated with Prince (and, on the same track, Lenny Henry!) on her album &lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;album-digest-january-2011-summary&quot;&gt;Album Digest January 2011 Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January has been rather good this year, with five solid enjoyable albums added to my collection. As I said at the start, it is usually the time for burying stinkers or trying to rejuvenate a flagging act. I think it is very interesting that the Iron &amp;amp; Wine album was given a release at a time of year when people might be less willing to try something out that has been reported as being a bit more difficult than previous work, then again perhaps the timing is to help get some traction through word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February will see new albums by &lt;strong&gt;PJ Harvey&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;The Low Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;, both of which I am quite excited by. Unfortunately, it looks like the shortage of quality electronic or dance releases continues. I listen to a lot of electronic stuff but there doesn’t seem to be much on the horizon at the moment apart from the &lt;strong&gt;James Blake&lt;/strong&gt; album that is out next week. If you know of anything electronic coming soon, or in any genre, feel free to suggest it in the comments! I’d be particularly interested to know if the &lt;strong&gt;Chase &amp;amp; Status&lt;/strong&gt; album is worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>In Defence Of Tolerance</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/in-defence-of-tolerance"/>
   <updated>2011-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/in-defence-of-tolerance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve found twitter to be a bit boring lately but today a perfect storm brew up and once again the Daily Mail and one of its odious columnists was at its centre. Melanie Phillips’ opinion piece was a perfectly constructed piece of trolling that implied that since the repeal of section 28, schools have been flooded with an influx of gay propaganda in subjects like maths, history and geography. Well I’m all for it, Alan Turing &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a genius brutally mistreated by his country despite turning the second world war in favour of the allies - that story is maths and history is combined. Meanwhile, if you can spice up geography a bit go for it. I am not sure what you would do, discuss routes for pride marches? After all, the subject is hideously out of date now that we all have google maps on our phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Melanie Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, she probably does not have google maps on her phone. It is probably old school, like her views. And just like that hypothetical phone, her views are out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to get incredibly angry about homophobia. I speak here as a nominally bisexual man (I’d say one or two notches off straight on the Kinsey scale), so I do view it as a personal attack when such views are spouted. I see her views as a slur not on gay people but everyone I regard as a friend, everyone that I love. You see, there is no gay agenda as she bleats about in her ridiculous tract, there is only the concern that one should treat others as they would expect to be treated. She is being intolerant about tolerant people, she is accusing tolerant people of being intolerant. She cannot see the forest for the trees. In fact, in desperately trying to ally herself with Christian values, she can no longer see Jesus, only the cross (I’m not very good at theology, so I may not return to this point - ask politely in the comments if you fancy a discussion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. I &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to get angry about this. Now I am just disappointed. On Saturday, I went to see a glorious film called &lt;em&gt;The Portuguese Nun&lt;/em&gt;. It really is brilliant, I cannot recommend it enough. Set in Lisbon, it recounts the adventures of an actress in the city to make a film about a nun who runs off with a soldier in the 17th century. It is about faith, family and living one’s life without passing judgement on others. Even the nun that the central character encounters, devout as she is, is possessed of tolerance and faith, not faith in place of tolerance or tolerance in place of faith. From this believable and touching representation of genuine religious faith, I know that faith is not incompatible with tolerance and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, central to this hissy fit of the Daily Mail columnist is the story about a Christian couple who owned a B&amp;amp;B; and refused to allow a gay couple to share a room. Apparently homosexuality was incompatible with their faith and they felt it was unnatural. I find this disturbing and hilarious in equal measure. I am disturbed by the fact that one couple who love each other very much could tell another couple that their love was wrong. This upsets me a lot. And moreover, this notion that homosexuality is unnatural - not for gay or bisexual people it isn’t! For them, pretending to be heterosexual would be. By that logic, I think that motorists are unnatural. We’re clearly designed to walk on two legs and that’s how God intended it. Everyone who drives a car is going to hell. It’s a shame, because I know some very nice people who drive cars. Sometimes they give me lifts to places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, someone wrote their opinion in a paper I hate and I disagreed. Whoop-de-doo. It’s disappointing because you would think that they would prefer to be crowing about the glorious demolition job that our hateful government is perpetrating against the society that they hate and clearly have no stake in preserving. This is why I had to write this post, to say that I read it anyway and I disagree with it. I believe there are plenty of decent and tolerant people out there who agree with me. They can’t be allowed to feed on our good will and optimism and love for the sake of their hatred and fear and their lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://istyosty.com/tmp/cache/88fc8b4882101bd82a14149dbbe752ac1a96a2cc.html#ixzz1BwxsZyYv&quot;&gt;Here is a link to the piece&lt;/a&gt; - if you use this, you won’t add to the hit count of their website and they won’t be able to claim to advertisers that their awful website gets your eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #7: 100 Broken Windows by Idlewild</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-07"/>
   <updated>2011-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-07</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Idewild are a solid band who have released four or five albums that I could consider for this series. I’m even in the sleeve credits of one: &lt;em&gt;Post-Electric Blues&lt;/em&gt;, if you’re asking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I went for &lt;em&gt;100 Broken Windows&lt;/em&gt; because it means a lot to me. It has more of a place in my life than the others. Usually I find that this happens if I can remember where I bought an album. In this case I bought a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22533522&quot;&gt;cassette&lt;/a&gt; in Bath HMV at Easter 2000. I can remember the first time that I listened to it too, it was as I marched home to Oldfield Park down Bathwick hill from the &lt;a href=&quot;www.bath.ac.uk&quot;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; that same afternoon. It took exactly the two sides of the tape to get from one door to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That period of time - from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-to-door&quot;&gt;door to door&lt;/a&gt; - is about the perfect length for an album. Starting with &lt;em&gt;Little Discourage&lt;/em&gt;, a wonderful little anthem about wanting the world and never getting it, the album tumbles and spits its way through side one. It pauses for breath with &lt;em&gt;Let Me Sleep (Next To The Mirror)&lt;/em&gt; (“I’m sure that you’ll be fine / ten more years of this it will nearly be time”) but it has to after the tracks that precede it. You have &lt;em&gt;I Don’t Have The Map&lt;/em&gt;, which re-tells the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crusoe/&quot;&gt;Robinson Crusoe&lt;/a&gt; tale while relocating it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://visit.shetland.org&quot;&gt;the Shetlands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Roseability&lt;/em&gt; is an anthem to philosopher &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/gertrude-stein&quot;&gt;Gertrude Stein&lt;/a&gt;: “Gertrude Stein says that’s enough / I know that it’s not enough now”. Then there is a plea to see the world afresh in &lt;em&gt;These Wooden Ideas&lt;/em&gt;: “You can’t keep waiting for progress / You can wait but I can’t accept at all”. It all rushes by in such a brash and energetic fashion that side one seems to end within a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention &lt;em&gt;Idea Track&lt;/em&gt; from side one. It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeform.org.uk&quot;&gt;freeform&lt;/a&gt; track, in keeping with its title, and it’s a song that taught me how to accept something unfinished-sounding. The “chorus”, such as it is, is wonderfully crunchy and shouty, the sort of thing that Roddy had to give up on as time went on and wore out his voice. &lt;em&gt;100 Broken Windows&lt;/em&gt; is the last of the Idlewild albums to feature shouty vocals. Many fans lament this but, the disastrous &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nme.com/reviews/7620&quot;&gt;Warnings/Promises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; aside, all their albums have been good - whether they are shouty or not. Oh and the coda of &lt;em&gt;Idea Track&lt;/em&gt; foreshadows some of the sounds that would come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side two launches with &lt;em&gt;Listen to what you’ve got&lt;/em&gt; (“What’s in these bad dreams / you might as well be talking backwards”) and then explodes straight into &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/62235/&quot;&gt;Actually its darkness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; before you notice the blisters. &lt;em&gt;Actually its darkness&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; minute pop song, albeit slightly more pyromaniac than you might be used to. It makes me incredibly happy, especially the first delivery of the line: “You’re scared to say I’m sorry I missed you” that then gets the rejoinder “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Cynic&quot;&gt;why can’t you be more cynical&lt;/a&gt;?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two songs &lt;em&gt;Rusty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mistake Pageant&lt;/em&gt; are also great, a pair that would have been singles on any other album not already stuffed to the gills with hooks. The former is an out-an-out rocker with more shouting, the lyrics deriding someone who hides in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croft&quot;&gt;croft&lt;/a&gt; in search of authenticity. The latter is beautiful little song about bad parties and the social awkwardness that goes with them. I think this was the song I most related to as an undergraduate: “I know what it feels to have bad luck”. It has wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hooksandharmony.com/20-great-r-e-m-songs/&quot;&gt;R.E.M.-style harmonies&lt;/a&gt;, which sets it apart nicely from the rest of the songs on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penultimate song &lt;em&gt;The Quiet Crown&lt;/em&gt; is one of my all-time favourite songs. On my MSc at &lt;a href=&quot;www.york.ac.uk&quot;&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;, I played this song at full volume on my walkman immediately before every exam for luck. A few years later, I would put the lyrics on my bedroom door. I am not sure if the lyrics were a message for me or someone else (that’s all I am prepared to say). It’s an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem&quot;&gt;anthem&lt;/a&gt; and it has the lines “Everything’s gone wrong”, “Everything’s broken now” and “Everything’s gone running without a sound” all delivered with the sense that the world is collapsing but somehow still fine. I think that’s what makes it suitable for exam tension and broken hearts in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album closes with the spare and strident &lt;em&gt;The Bronze Medal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/62240/&quot;&gt;a song I’ve never quite figured out&lt;/a&gt;. The chorus begins “Nothing but your eyes looking down on the third place” and there is a sense of impossible sadness running throughout. I guess to be third place in a relationship is to be the wrong side of a love triangle, but then there is all that stuff about throwing the radio on to the fire as well. It was probably because the album closes in such a spooky way just as I reached home that made it such a rewarding accompaniment to my walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this album, listening to it again has reminded me of people, places, and times that are simultaneously gone yet also preserved forever inside me. I could only ever regard it as a complete and utter classic.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Programming an UNO game</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/programming-an-uno-game"/>
   <updated>2010-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/programming-an-uno-game</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-new-year-a-new-hobby&quot;&gt;A new year, a new hobby&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t write about programming enough. This is a shame because it is a very interesting subject and I find that the problem solving aspects of programming are very satisfying. Keenly aware of the need to do more hobby programming and to get up to speed on areas of software development that I’ve been neglecting, I have decided to give myself the project of creating a computerised version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)&quot;&gt;UNO card game&lt;/a&gt;. I know that one already exists, for example there’s an official one that you can play on MSN messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first few posts I am going to describe the game and its rules, and then how I came to design their implementation in  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B&quot;&gt;C++ code&lt;/a&gt;. I have started with C++ because it is the closest that programming has to a &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt;, which will help in my attempts to take the code beyond the algorithms for representing the card deck and the game play. It is not the most difficult thing in the world to program but it will serve as a nice illustration of some standard library features. Card games like UNO are great for illustrating the behaviour of things like structs and the decks and hands used in the game play are a nice way to demonstrate the differences between the different generic containers in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beyond-just-implementing-the-game&quot;&gt;Beyond just implementing the game&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, the project is still in flux and what I will end up doing is still very much dependent on how much time I find myself with in the coming months, along with how successful (or otherwise) my code turns out to be. Nevertheless, there are several interesting platforms and arenas in which the resulting code may end up being used. At the moment this includes investigating how to package the code for installation with both Windows and one of the major Linux distributions (probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;), how to deliver it using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/air/&quot;&gt;Adobe AIR&lt;/a&gt; and/or Flash, and how to set up the game in-browser with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/&quot;&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that I will also need a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&quot;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt;, which is another aspect of programming that I have rarely touched save for a scientific calculator programmed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/developers/&quot;&gt;Cocoa&lt;/a&gt; - oh how I wish I had kept up my Cocoa programming post-iphone! I think I will start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://qt.nokia.com/&quot;&gt;Qt&lt;/a&gt; for the Linux implementation and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation&quot;&gt;Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF)&lt;/a&gt; for a Windows Vista/7 version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to think about than just the GUI and how to deliver the finished executable. I am really interested in trying to cover as many bases as possible, both in terms of languages used and software design. I hope I will be able to write posts like “Why programming language &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is really bad for programming an UNO game”, “How I implemented feature &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;” (there are lots of alternative rules in UNO, so it will be nice to configure the game to an individual’s particular taste) and “How to let the computer do Z without looking as though it is cheating”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hold-the-horses&quot;&gt;Hold the horses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. Let’s see how I do! There are obviously lots of exciting things to do but I have to actually take the baby steps forward first. In a couple of days, I will write a post where I work through the representation of the cards, the players and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)#Official_rules&quot;&gt;the game rules&lt;/a&gt; in C++ - or at least as far as I can get in a thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-question-of-identity&quot;&gt;A question of identity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three letters for Dad in the mail today, three variations on our surname including the aquatic &lt;em&gt;Dory&lt;/em&gt; version and the lesser-spotted &lt;em&gt;Dorny&lt;/em&gt;. It is perhaps best not to go back to the time he was accidentally listed in the Thompson directory as Mr. Dopey, bringing forth prank calls from all teenagers within a ten mile radius. Fortunately, Dr. Dorey doesn’t have this problem with his mail: he doesn’t get any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-visitor&quot;&gt;The visitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dad has a way with an ornithological yarn. He told the tale of how a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxwing&quot;&gt;waxwing&lt;/a&gt; caused a commotion in the garden last week. He claims that seventy or so tits (steady now!) were all up in the same tree as the waxwing, as though it had celebrity status. Waxwings are more common in Scandinavia and tend to travel in packs. They are remarkable for their crests and the bright flash of yellow on their wing tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waxwing was probably after the berries rather than adoration from the locals. Apparently they are voracious eaters, able to consume twice their mass in berries in one day. Perhaps this one was off course because of the recent bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad took lots of pictures and he’s let me use some here. I really like them even though you can only see the yellow wings in a couple of pictures, though that marvellous crest is prominent throughout. The pictures are a bit fuzzy because of the zoom but I think the colour of the sky, the branches and berries, together with the silhouette of the bird, certainly make them interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/Waxwing1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dad's pictures of Waxwings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/Waxwing2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dad's pictures of Waxwings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/Waxwing3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dad's pictures of Waxwings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-naked-prince&quot;&gt;The Naked Prince&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of being at home now is that I managed to get a lie-in. I slept like a log, probably due to the relief of getting back home without too much fuss and with presents intact. It might also have been the meditation and relaxation exercises I did before turning out the lights last night. When I woke up, I marvelled at how I had managed to wrap the headphones back around my iPod, until I realised I hadn’t listened to it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a long lie-in, revelling in being naked and warm under the covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-englishmans-home-is-his-castle&quot;&gt;An Englishman’s home is his castle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No sooner had my parents put the house up for sale, they only went and sold it. Here was me thinking “I’ve heard this before they won’t sell it” and they went and got a great offer after just three days. They aren’t staying in Emsworth so this may well be the last time I am able to spend Christmas in the area. I think I will miss it terribly as there is just something uniquely calming about the place. It is hard to imagine being able to come back if not to see Mum and Dad, perhaps I should have worked harder to maintain my friendships in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be strange to completely cut the connection to home in this way, I guess that I have never truly settled anywhere else because this bond with home remained so strong. It is also  a bond that had been strengthened recently - after all, I wrote most of my PhD thesis there in the spring of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a nice place to grow up. A decent sized garden that caught the sun in the afternoons. On hot days, our Labradors would lie and pant in the shade of the fence. Until about 2000, that fence would collapse in the first strong wind of Autumn. I think of the house itself as a place stuffed with books. It may be the root of my book fetish. Many of those tomes will likely go because parents are inevitably downsizing: there may not be room for the weird medical dictionary that I would obsess over while my parents were out, or the huge collection of vinyl that made me fall in love with music. Perhaps I shall be able to liberate &lt;a href=&quot;uc3&quot;&gt;The Circle &amp;amp; The Square&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shorn-of-the-winter-coat&quot;&gt;Shorn of the winter coat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went down to the train station and got my hair cut by the lady there. Again it might be the last time for that too. We exchanged jokes and I gave her a kiss under the mistletoe. Powerful stuff that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a grade three as per usual, it reduces the colour of my hair to a silky grey once again. I forget what having full coloured hair is like now. I did not forget so easily what it was like to have my head protected by three months of growth though. On the way home I was very grateful for my woolly hoodie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;im-going-out-and-i-may-be-some-time&quot;&gt;I’m going out, and I may be some time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had one more present that needed to be wrapped because I had run out of brown paper. I walked over to Havant after drawing a blank in both Emsworth and Westbourne. This meant a five mile walk in the snow, which for some reason I decided to do in just my hoodie: no scarf or coat. Not to mention that my shoes have holes in the soles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was bloody cold but I enjoyed the march aided by &lt;em&gt;High Violet&lt;/em&gt; by The National and &lt;em&gt;Body Talk&lt;/em&gt; by Robyn. These two count among my favourite albums of the year. If I get the time, I will do one of those annoying top ten lists on new year’s eve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapping Christmas presents in brown paper involves a rather strange constraint, you can only get rolls of the stuff that are half a metre wide. This made wrapping some of the gifts a bit tricky but it is worth it because they look nice in an austere, minimal way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #6: Arbor Bona Arbor Mala by The Shamen</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-06"/>
   <updated>2010-12-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask anyone into pop music between 1991 and 1993 about The Shamen, and you’ll either receive a flood of euphoric good will about excellent tracks like &lt;em&gt;Move Any Mountain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;LSI&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Phorever People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; or they will rant at you about the evils of &lt;em&gt;Ebeneezer Goode&lt;/em&gt;. The Shamen are either one of the pantheon of great acts from early 90’s dance and electronic music, or they are a shameless vaudeville novelty act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this post should imply where I stand on this. I think The Shamen were awesome, not awesomely cheesy but just awesome. They had a clear vision of what their music was supposed to be about, which in turn led to a definite blueprint for how it should sound. For radio, they allowed the record company to smooth the weirder edges of their songs by handing them over to remixers like The Beatmasters. In this they way their songs could be prepared for mass consumption without having to get too involved in it. Meanwhile, their albums featured a lot of deeper material that allowed them to indulge in more experimental ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outsourcing of their pop hits worked well for &lt;em&gt;En-tact&lt;/em&gt; (1990 and re-released in 1991)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Boss Drum&lt;/em&gt; (1992), these albums yielded four and six Top 40 singles respectively. All six singles from the latter reached the top 20. The sixth was “Re: Evolution” - a spoken word monologue that predicted the end of the world and extolled the virtues of psychedelic drugs! For eight minutes! In exactly the same version as on the album!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their new found success, the band expanded simultaneously outward and inward: outward onto the internet in pioneering fashion, giving away MP3 clips of songs and making available a MIDI version of one of their singles; and inward into the realms of the rainforest for a concept album about the jungle, the mind-altering experiences of shamanism, and the need for ecological balance in order to sustain the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;axis-mutatis&quot;&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting album, &lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt; (1995), was probably originally titled &lt;em&gt;Axis Mundi&lt;/em&gt; but another band released an album with that name in 1994. There is a great seven minute instrumental called &lt;em&gt;Axis Mundi&lt;/em&gt; on the second half of the album. &lt;em&gt;Axis Mundi&lt;/em&gt; refers to a ‘tree of the world’ and the album is set up as a quest to find this tree. Think of it as &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; re-done as techno-pop, though nowhere near as rubbish at that sounds. I get the feeling that the record company was initially offered a looser, more experimental version of &lt;em&gt;Axis…&lt;/em&gt; (whatever kind of tree it was at that stage) and that they sent it back. Hence &lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt;, ‘the changed tree’, eventually released after many delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt; is front loaded with Beatmasters versions of the two lead singles and another track &lt;em&gt;MK2A&lt;/em&gt; (probably the best pop song ever written about the astronomical telescopes on top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii). Almost every song with vocals has a production credit that implies that it has been remixed for radio. That is apart from &lt;em&gt;Prince of Popacatepetl&lt;/em&gt;, which does indeed feature the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popocatepetl&quot;&gt;Popacatepetl&lt;/a&gt; in the chorus and is presumably why the record company had it left alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair to the record company this partial remixing approach had worked rather well for &lt;em&gt;En-tact&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Boss Drum&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;En-tact&lt;/em&gt; is practically a &lt;em&gt;Who’s who&lt;/em&gt; of fashionable remixers active at that time; while on &lt;em&gt;Boss Drum&lt;/em&gt; the band were on a hot streak of songwriting form at the time, so the remixes weren’t as necessary&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unfortunately, the tunes deserted them when it came to making &lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt; or perhaps they felt self-conscious about the poppier side of things. It is probably this rather than evil record company machinations that make &lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt; somewhat uneven&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good-the-bad-and-the-tree&quot;&gt;The Good, The Bad and The Tree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, The Shamen actually released a better album than &lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt; at exactly the same time. Called &lt;em&gt;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&lt;/em&gt; (“Good Tree, Bad Tree”), it was bundled with a limited number of copies of &lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, the Friday before its release was my last day on a work experience placement at HMV in Portsmouth - I unpacked all the copies of &lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt; that arrived and I can tell you that about a third of the copies had &lt;em&gt;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&lt;/em&gt; attached to it! Naturally, I was in first thing the following Monday to get my copy!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&lt;/em&gt; is an ambient techno album that is almost entirely instrumental and is mixed into one continuous track. I was used to long form ambient music at that time, albeit stuff that varied quite quickly in the thematic sense (like albums by Mike Oldfield) or crammed with (often humorous) vocal samples that helped to tell the story (like albums by The Orb). &lt;em&gt;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&lt;/em&gt; was much more subtle and actually scared me a bit. It shifts between its moods slowly and surely, from a beautiful ambient opening to a rather dark middle to a pulsating ending. A younger me would often fall asleep at night during the dreamier parts of &lt;em&gt;Sefirotic Axis&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Entraterrestial&lt;/em&gt;, only to be woken up by the woozy gales of found sound in &lt;em&gt;Beneath the Underworld&lt;/em&gt; or failing that, later on during the pounding beats of the similarly titled &lt;em&gt;West of the Underworld&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I find it easier to pick out the individual elements within the tracks and it makes for an amazing sound journey. It sounds great when played in surround sound. The credits in the inlay imply that some tracks were specifically programmed with stereospatial effects. There is certainly a satisfying sense of space within the music in 5.1, as though the different musical elements are separate entities moving within space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&lt;/em&gt; is compelling not just because of the style of music but also the nature of the sounds themselves. The Shamen had some good kit and there are some really wonderfully physical sounds here that have been built with analogue synths rather than existing as digital shadows within a computer. It is this physicality of the sound that makes &lt;em&gt;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&lt;/em&gt; so enjoyable to listen to: when the music drifts you really feel the sounds drifting; when the music becomes propulsive you get knocked off your feet (or woken up in the case of my 15 year old self); when synth lines drift from left to right, you to turn to look at where they are going. Ambient music isn’t any good if it is inert, it needs to provide something for the listener to interact with - I’ve provided &lt;a href=&quot;uc4&quot;&gt;an example of excellent and engaging ambient music&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it is not all bloops and bleeps. &lt;em&gt;Xochipili’s Return&lt;/em&gt; features a wonderful acoustic guitar line that plays out through a languid ambient background. You can almost imagine striding through the long grasses in the moonlight6. Guitars feature again on the following track &lt;em&gt;Rio Negro&lt;/em&gt; but this time as twangs that accompany bird like whistles and insect chirps - at this point the mix begins to pick up the pace a little. It reminds me of the &lt;em&gt;Comin’ Unsung&lt;/em&gt; version of &lt;em&gt;Comin’ On&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Boss Drum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album closes with three upbeat tunes: &lt;em&gt;A Moment In Dub&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pizarro In Paradise&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;West of the Underworld&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Pizarro In Paradise&lt;/em&gt; is as poppy as &lt;em&gt;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&lt;/em&gt; gets and draws from the same lineage as &lt;em&gt;Conquistador&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Axis Mutatis&lt;/em&gt; (it’s not just the names!). An interesting game is to think of &lt;em&gt;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&lt;/em&gt; as a remixed version of its parent album, though if that is the case it is a radical collection of remixes. There are few recognisable hooks from the &lt;em&gt;Axis&lt;/em&gt; tracks - and a few from the band’s own remixes taken from the singles. One example is the &lt;em&gt;Escacid&lt;/em&gt; remix of &lt;em&gt;Destination Eschaton&lt;/em&gt; that underpins &lt;em&gt;Be Ready for the Storm&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final track, &lt;em&gt;Out in the Styx&lt;/em&gt;, returns the listener to the outside world on shanty boat sailing along a river of silt. At least that’s how it has always sounded to me! The ambient sounds of earlier tracks return, but it’s much faster and harsher, like the end of a bad dream. Or indeed, the voyage back from a world beyond. Why on earth did I listen to this album in bed at night half a lifetime ago?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phorever People&lt;/em&gt; was so awesome that my Dad would play the cassette single over and over in the car. Either that or I made him. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The two versions of En-Tact side-by-side is an interesting window into this process. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Listen to the album versions of &lt;em&gt;Space Time&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Comin’ On&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Phorever People&lt;/em&gt; for proof. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of course there is demonstrable evidence for the “evil record company” theory. The Shamen’s next album &lt;em&gt;Hempton Manor&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; instrumental and the tracklist spelled out “FUCK BIRKET” as an acrostic. Derek Birket was the founder of One Little Indian, their record company at the time. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I now own two copies of the Axis/Arbor double: one on CD and one on vinyl. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>The Setback</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-setback"/>
   <updated>2010-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-setback</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since the run there has been a bit of a hiatus in this blog. I wrote about how running was making me feel better. In fact, I should have said more. I recently stopped taking the antidepressants that I had been taking for eighteen months. This has been my longest period taking such medication but the running made me feel sufficiently good to decide that I could stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not easy at first. In fact, after the first two weeks I went back to my GP to complain about being anxious and unable to sleep. It seemed weird to not be able to sleep at that time given how tiring my running schedule had become by that point. I was told that I should persevere because being better without the medication would be better than feeling better on the medication. I believed him and was grateful for the advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-do-it-to-yourself-just-you&quot;&gt;You do it to yourself, just you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, since the run I have suffered a bit of a setback. I decided to try and write about it here in order to explain what has been going on in my head and how I have been feeling. I freely admit that the person I most want to explain all of this to is myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to previous experiences, this time it has been a minor experience - I would guess that many people may not have noticed at all but it has been quite bad from the inside. Not as bad as when I was first diagnosed, back then there were mornings when I couldn’t get out of bed. My experience has been one of a marked absence of pleasure: no enjoyment of food, no libido, too much swearing, inability to relax, dark thoughts. The experience of listlessness has been particularly frustrating. For example, I might think up an idea for a blog post and then find that an hour has passed with not so much as a pencil lifted or a character typed. My thoughts have felt very disconnected from my actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a visual metaphor for depression, the two balls of blu-tak in the photo below. They are meant to be identical but blu-tak turns out to be less malleable than plasticine or modelling clay. That’s ok though, we are all different after all. Well, there is one more obvious difference between the two balls: one has a depression. It looks glib on the surface but I do not mean that the depression in the ball is meant to describe depression, rather the feeling of external deformation of what might be perceived to be normal. Some people have it worse: they don’t have the reference point, just the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/balls2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ahhh-look-at-all-the-lonely-people&quot;&gt;Ahhh, look at all the lonely people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully within the next few days I will finish watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/&quot;&gt;“Moon”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1315981/&quot;&gt;“A Single Man”&lt;/a&gt;, two films that I bought last weekend and realised would make a good entry in my somewhat neglected great movie double bills series. When that article is live, you will be able to reach it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not want to say too much about the two films now as I will end up making that future post redundant. However, I did find it amusing to ponder how out of all the DVDs in HMV Oxford Street, I managed to pick out two about men experiencing difficulties due to loneliness. I guess it says something for my state of mind: perhaps even that it is improving slightly if I am willing to explore these things. I am yet to watch either film so I may be a bit wrong about their intent, especially as trailers seem to be increasingly deceptive these days about the nature of the films they are advertising. Full disclosure, I started watching “Moon” on Saturday night and got a bit creeped out by the first twenty minutes, not uncomfortable just scared!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loneliness seems to be a particular fetish of mine. Or rather a fetish of my depression, which I tend to regard as another part of me, some other creature. I’m rarely alone (in London, how could you be?) but I often feel lonely (in London, how could you not be?). There are many times when I feel like a cipher, as though I am a token presence that the world can live without. I hope that this is not the case but I don’t really have any evidence to rule it out. It is my own fault really, I still can’t help but withdraw in situations where I feel uncomfortable or out of my depth and that tends to include a lot of personal and professional situations. I am often painfully slow or overly hasty in attempting to express myself. Even in intimate relationships and friendships, I have found myself feeling isolated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that I often have more people to talk to these days and I do tend to find that when I discuss these sorts of feelings with people, a lot of them feel the same way though perhaps they are better apt to dealing with them or they project that better at least. I am very grateful for this. At a time of greater difficulty back in St Albans, I did tend to find myself sealed off from friends and colleagues in London. Now that I have two exceedingly nice flatmates, I don’t have this problem so much. It is not that our living room is a seething confessional in which the world is put to rights, it can just be a haven of crap TV of an evening! I’m very lucky, even if I have ended up watching far too much X Factor this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;despite-all-my-rage-i-am-still-just-a-rat-in-a-cage&quot;&gt;Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not being very emotionally articulate, I am learning more about myself as I get older. I am learning that it is better to not hold on to negative emotions and self-perceptions if you can help it. This is not the same as a sunny mantra of “accentuate the positive” as we obviously need to be aware of when things are going wrong: there’s no point looking on the bright side about bugs in your computer program, you need to be annoyed that they are there until they are gone! Likewise, I can be very prickly about criticism but I have learned that although you have to try and keep that prickliness under control (My new mantra: “Prickliness is for pricks”) you cannot throw the baby out with the bath water and not act upon what people tell you. Unless they are idiots trying to get you down of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of this as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_mindfulness&quot;&gt;attempting to live in the present moment as much as possible&lt;/a&gt;. I have been thinking a lot about how depression relates to our self-image and how it can be built up not only from our relationships to the outside world but also from things that are iterations of that relationship: not only the outside world itself but our expectations and sense of responsibility towards it. I’ll admit that with my interior life, egocentrism is never too far away. I’m acutely aware that if you filter out the common english words from this blog post, you will be left with quite a few “myself”s!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_LSD&quot;&gt;Early (pseudo-)scientific experiments with LSD&lt;/a&gt; were concerned with using the drug to take apart the self and to explore the unconscious mind, with Timothy Leary’s book about the Tibetan Book of The Dead informing John Lennon’s lyric for the acid sound painting “Tomorrow Never Knows”: “Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream”. Unfortunately the experiments of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary&quot;&gt;Leary&lt;/a&gt; and his followers did not lead to new psychiatric treatments, at least not in the way that they had prophesied or hoped; the doors that opened were not ones to perception but often to madness and psychosis instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these notions of abdicating from the self were not simply posited as an excuse to take a shed load of drugs. It was a genuine attempt to find a western response to both the mysticism of the east and the role played by shamanism and vision quests in many of the aboriginal cultures of the American continent. I think the way that popular culture has incorporated “flower power” into our mythos and how we continue to regard many illicit drugs as potential avenues of personal revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am driving at here, in an admittedly cack-handed way, is that I believe that a lot of peoples’ unhappiness - mine included - is down to the overdeveloped sense of self that seems to be required of us by the modern world. Required for what? Advertising, social status, career, fashion, capitalism… all the things that make me go “yuck!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is based solely on my own experiences and I am not about to suggest that anyone else take all this as gospel, this is just what makes sense to me. Note the presence of the tag “Pretending I know what I’m talking about” (NB: there are no tags now that I have stopped using WordPress), it appears with some frequency on this blog. However, I think that the way forward is to journey outward into the world and engage with it. My experiences with the run are proof that it works (again, for me, I can’t generalise) and the subsequent setback afterwards indicates the need to maintain this engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-one-bird-in-my-house&quot;&gt;There is one bird in my house&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that’s the situation. Obviously I have to keep running but also to keep my brain flowing I have decided to take up a hobby or three. This blog gives me the opportunity to keep my hand in with the facets of web design that interest me, not to mention the chance to write. Obviously, it is much more interesting when I go out and do things worth writing about, I definitely look forward to doing that in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in December 2006 when my PhD was really stressing me out, I decided to make handmade Christmas cards and send them out to people I knew. There were twenty of them, each with a unique photo (there are some really good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=christmas&amp;amp;w=commons&amp;amp;s=int&quot;&gt;creative commons images on flickr that are tagged with Christmas&lt;/a&gt;) and a unique shorty story inside. This year I was going to expand each of those stories and write four more; unfortunately there has not been enough time so it will have to be next year, five years on. I cite those cards now, as a teaser for the creative stuff I intend to dig into in the next few months. Here’s to an end to setbacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And an end to blog posts like this one, which are about miserable things and take four evenings to write!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, Saturday. Finally. The big day. Would I a) be able to get to Greenwich in time for the registration? and b) be able to make it all the way around the course without collapsing and crying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/movember01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily the answer to both questions was a resounding “Yes!” and I really enjoyed it. The weather was really good, especially compared to the two days before hand, and Marc came along to take some brilliant photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/movember02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time was 62 minutes according to the Mo’ Running website. This was 3 minutes less than the target I set myself back in August when I didn’t even have a clue what ten kilometres was like to walk, let alone run! It’s also about ten minutes faster than my previous attempts at 10K but some of those previous runs may have been over a slightly greater distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/movember03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was more hilly than expected (despite a previous scouting mission!) but I found that most of the hills were at agreeable inclines that made it more comfortable to run. I’ve since been told that this can be the case if you have bad knees. I think this might be the case for me because my knees have been what have hurt the most during my training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/movember04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found running in a group of over a thousand people to be a very fun experience and would recommend it! I did feel a bit gutted that some people in very silly costumes finished ages ahead of me - it is for this reason that I have redacted a picture of me crossing the finish line because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=15657264&amp;amp;l=d25a8ce551&amp;amp;id=666555246&quot;&gt;someone clearly dressed as Albert Einstein is relaxing against the railings obviously having long finished&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/movember05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the way around I was comfortable, though at times I was a little incredulous at how little of the total distance I had done. It was  a fair course though because although the initial circuits were rather dull, they at least weren’t too hilly and moreover, the final 2.5 kilometres back down from the top of the long hill was pretty easy, save for the last hill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/movember06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had raised £557.50 prior to the race from 34 sponsors, so I added another £34 myself. I originally had a target of £1000 but I am glad to have made 99% of my revised £600 target - given that this represents 60% of the original target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/movember07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have said already, the training has been a very worthwhile experience and I definitely intend to keep going with the training. I am still in two minds as to whether I will do another proper race but I definitely have at least two more charities that I would like to raise money for. Don’t be surprised if you see a new justgiving widget on the site in a few months time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/movember08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I obviously owe a great thanks to the people who ran with me: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marcbaguelin.eu&quot;&gt;Marc (who also took some nice photos)&lt;/a&gt;, Sarah, Stefano and Ruth. Thanks are also due to Yoon, who got me out into Silkstream Park for a run in the first place. I’d also like to thank Emilia and AJ for advice on running. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ajinthegambia.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;AJ’s tip from the Gambia&lt;/a&gt; to rest after Tuesday’s run was particularly appreciated!) If you sponsored me then I am really grateful as despite the personal benefits to me of all the training, raising the money was really the point. Obviously it is difficult in these times for charities to raise funds and for you all to have been so generous has been genuinely staggering. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #5: A Weekend In The City by Bloc Party</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-05"/>
   <updated>2010-11-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-05</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-weekend-in-the-city-background&quot;&gt;A Weekend In The City: Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the youngest album I have chosen for this series. I try to pick albums that are at least ten years old but every now and then, I will think of an album that matches the sort of things I want to write about. That’s the case here. &lt;em&gt;A Weekend in the City&lt;/em&gt; is an unusual album that, in a reversal of the old adage, is “easy to love but hard to admire”. Nevertheless I do love and admire it, and I would like to share my thoughts about it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Weekend in the City&lt;/em&gt; is the difficult second album from Bloc Party. It followed hard on the heels of their debut &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt;. For many, &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt; is the superior album and perhaps for sheer visceral thrills and exuberance it is. However, what &lt;em&gt;A Weekend in the City&lt;/em&gt; has that its predecessor lacks is a sense of scale and life experience. If you are a rock star, you can get agitated and vent in three-minute squally post-punk guitar songs. If you are an ordinary human being, you’re going to need a little bit more. With &lt;em&gt;A Weekend in the City&lt;/em&gt;, Bloc Party give us a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt; rocks out with its bleached white artwork and its manifesto of solving the world’s problems one three-minute blast at a time (War? &lt;em&gt;Helicopter&lt;/em&gt;; Doomed Romance? &lt;em&gt;So Here We Are&lt;/em&gt;; Global Warming? &lt;em&gt;Price of Gas&lt;/em&gt;; etc, etc); &lt;em&gt;A Weekend in the City&lt;/em&gt; instead sets its sights deeper and darker, evoking in its artwork the dark chill of driving at night in cities – lonely but not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;towards-the-dark-heart-of-saturday-night&quot;&gt;Towards The Dark Heart Of Saturday Night&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first this appears to be ‘second album syndrome’ writ large. The story is usually this. An energetic band gets saddled with touring a successful snappy debut album. They become introspective and pretentious, and release a dark and downbeat second album. The record company tries to market with adjectives like “brave” and “challenging”. The fans go looking for another successful snappy debut album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs on &lt;em&gt;A Weekend in the City&lt;/em&gt; are deeper and more three-dimensional than you’d expect from a band with second-album blues. Opener &lt;em&gt;Song for Clay&lt;/em&gt; is a corker, going from weedy falsetto to a full-on rock-out in the space of three and a half minutes. Once up and running it barely pauses for breath. This means that it could be any given song on &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Song for Clay&lt;/em&gt; has emotion packed in too. It is creepy, angry, and resigned all in one. The line “East London is a vampire / it sucks the joy right out of me” is delivered in such a cathartic way that it transcends whatever it might actually refer to or mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next track &lt;em&gt;Hunting for Witches&lt;/em&gt; is a tour-de-force track that updates &lt;em&gt;Helicopter&lt;/em&gt; with samplers, war on terror paranoia, and includes a brilliant swipe at the Daily Mail. While it does not pack as much of a punch as &lt;em&gt;Song for Clay&lt;/em&gt;, it does something that pop music often does not do: take difficult events and try to make sense of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waiting for the 7.18&lt;/em&gt; name checks Su Doku and the northern line. It also features a great line about wanting to “get the sadness out of those molars”. I find that the way that the chorus of “give me moments / not hours or days” bursts into the middle eight of “let’s drive to Brighton on the weekend” is really affecting and masterfully done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-b-sides-are-brilliant-too&quot;&gt;The B-sides Are Brilliant Too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit &lt;em&gt;The Prayer&lt;/em&gt; is not my favourite Bloc Party track. Spoilt and over the top, it too would sit well amid the earworms of &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt;. When issued as a single it had some great B-sides. One is one of the best songs that Bloc Party has ever made: &lt;em&gt;England&lt;/em&gt;. It is about a gay man who was kicked to death in a London Park. Sample lyric: “they kicked the back of his head like a ball… they filmed the beating on their mobile phones”. It is not cheery material but allayed to a delicate mournful guitar chime, it packs a powerful emotional punch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the album, &lt;em&gt;Uniform&lt;/em&gt; is its cerebral and emotional core. Sprawling over five and a half minutes, it decries the emptiness of modern life. Sample lyrics include: “you can be happy just play dumb”, “we tell ourselves we’re different” etc. For a while this song was my own personal anthem. This song is not that dark or difficult at all, nor is it a million miles from anything on &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt;, but its structure and subject matter make it feel a million years on from that first collection of songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that a song about the highs and lows of cocaine is something of a letdown. Nevertheless, &lt;em&gt;On&lt;/em&gt; manages to combine the dramatic subject matter with an interesting musical arrangement. The drums are excellent. Even better is how a cascade of guitar drones emerges out of the middle eight then into a string section underpinning a last repeat of the chorus. That whole section is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where is home?&lt;/em&gt; is about racism and is the most uncomfortable song on the album. Musically, it follows the pattern set by &lt;em&gt;Hunting for Witches&lt;/em&gt;, but at a slower pace. There’s a fantastic remix of it by Burial on the &lt;em&gt;Flux&lt;/em&gt; 12”. That remix that was my introduction to the wonders of dubstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unconventional-love-songs&quot;&gt;Unconventional Love Songs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes a brace of love songs. &lt;em&gt;Kreuzberg&lt;/em&gt; could easily have sat on &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt;, though it would have raised a few eyebrows with its tales of the emotional dangers of casual sex (“After sex / the bitter taste / been fooled again / the search continues”). I think it’s a gay love song (the hauptbanhof area of Berlin mentioned in the song is a well known cruising ground) but the message that casual sex is not edifying is universal for people of all sexual orientations. Also universal is the tale of teenage regret outlined in &lt;em&gt;I Still Remember&lt;/em&gt; with its tale of gallivanting along the canal in the school holidays – all done to a wonderfully cheesy 80s guitar figure. It tantalises with its recounting of fingers almost touching, heavy heartbeats and that kept tie. It is a shame that the most upbeat and playful on the album has to be shot through with such regret and nostalgia. Sometimes the worst thing to be told is “I’d have let you if you asked me”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some editions of the album have &lt;em&gt;Flux&lt;/em&gt; next. As it foreshadows the misstep of their third album &lt;em&gt;Intimacy&lt;/em&gt;, I choose to ignore it. Instead we have &lt;em&gt;Sunday&lt;/em&gt;, a sweet song that promises to “love you in the morning” when we’re “still hung-over and still strung out”. It is about the joys of just going out and having fun despite the problems in the world. Of enjoying the comfort of simply having someone to be there with. It provides some relief, but after the earlier darkness it doesn’t quite ring true. It’s a light to shine above the gloom but it’s too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rumoured that the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;England&lt;/em&gt; was going to be the final track. &lt;em&gt;SRXT&lt;/em&gt; is almost as melancholy as that would have been. The title refers to Seroxat, an antidepressant alleged to cause suicidal thoughts in teenagers that it was prescribed to. The song is not just about depression in young people but also the awkwardness of those years between child and adult. It is hard to tell whether the suicide related is successful or not (or is it something else? Is the narrator running away?) so the album ends on a weird ambivalent note. It’s simultaneously melancholy, disturbing, and quite brilliant, albeit in a despondent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Weekend in the City&lt;/em&gt; is truly an understated classic – an affecting and tumultuous emotional journey through the darker side of modern life. I listen to it and become thankful for the things I have, it makes me resolve to do better and be happier. What more could you ask for from an album?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. G. Ballard, The Crystal World</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-crystal-world"/>
   <updated>2010-09-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-crystal-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;crystallising-the-world-the-body-or-the-mind&quot;&gt;Crystallising the world, the body, or the mind?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, Ballard in full flow. The Crystal World (TCW) is definitely the most enjoyable of the triumvirate of apocalypse novels, taking successful elements of the first two and embellishing them with new details and ideas. For now, TCW is definitely the best Ballard novel that I have read in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action begins with a steamer travelling up a river in Cameroon carrying the novel’s main protagonist Edward Sanders, a doctor at a hospital for lepers. He is hoping to meet some friends, Max and Suzanne Clair, who are also doctors and run another leprosy hospital in a town named Mount Royal (also the name of the main city in “The Drought”). His motives are not entirely clear, he doubts his reasons for making the journey and the inference is that he had an affair with Suzanne Clair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, something is definitely up. Attention is drawn to the unnatural darkness of the forest, there is discussion of an eclipse (“Surely the duration would be a maximum of eight minutes”) and later it is mentioned that the forest also shines at night. The letter from Suzanne Clair inviting Sanders to Mount Royal states: “The forest is the most beautiful in Africa, a house of jewels… The light touches everything with diamonds and sapphires”. It appears to Sanders that her description of the forest is consistent with having contracted leprosy herself: “in maculoanaesthetic leprosy there was an involvement of nervous tissue”. The motive for Sanders going up the river may be sentimental as well as sexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accompanying Sanders is a sinister man named Ventress who is described as having a “skull-like” face. He is the only passenger who will travel with the doctor as the remaining passengers believe that they may catch leprosy from him. This is a fear that Ventress dispels with a grim sense of humour in this bon mot: “What our timorous fellow passengers fail to realise is that outside of your colony there is merely a larger one.” These discussions are a clever device for framing Sanders within events and between communities. Whereas in the previous two books, the protagonist is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other principal characters are a Jesuit priest, Father Balthaus, and a young journalist Louise Perec. Balthaus causes a commotion in the market place by shaking  crystals from a bejewelled crucifix that has been offered to him for sale. He calls it obscene and whirls the crucifix around his head, thus establishing Balthaus as the de facto ‘crazy religious guy’. In this episode, Ballard takes the time to establish the rules for his crystals. They attach themselves to ordinary objects encasing them in crystals and jewels. However, when agitated the crystals can be shaken off the objects and they disappear in a flash of light. An overused word throughout the book is “deliquesce”, which means for a solid to disappear into the air. I can see the attraction of the word; before I looked it up I presumed that it meant to emit light – I think the sound of the word is suggestive of the emission of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst temporarily prevented from going on to Mount Royal by the army, Sanders meets Louise Perec, a journalist who suspects that something odd is going on. He photographer has gone missing up river in Mount Royal. It doesn’t end well for the guy, his partially crystallised corpse floats down the river and catalyses the plot. The opening exchange between Louise and Sanders is quite funny and shows that despite the detached nature of Ballard’s characters he does often imbue them with a wry sense of humour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Do you want to go to Mount Royal, Doctor?’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sanders began to walk off, the young woman following him. ‘Are you a police spy?’ he asked. ‘Or running an underground bus service? Or both, perhaps?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, our heroes travel up the river where Sanders finds that his status as a doctor gains him access to events in the affected zone. In short, he ends up in the crystallised forest - the crystal world of the title. The language up to this point (almost the entirety of part one) is very restrained and clinical but with the introduction of the crystallised zone, the vocabulary changes dramatically to convey the majesty and terror of the crystal world. The language used to describe the forest is ecstatic, with a great emphasis on how the change of the natural world into a crystalline one impacts upon the senses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall not provide (m)any more plot spoilers and will instead wrap up with how clever I thought this novel was in comparison with the previous two. In “The Drowned World” both the world and the protagonist are, to some extent, lost forever. In “The Drought” world and protagonist are saved from the brink of madness by the drops of rain that start to fall at the end. In TCW, we cannot be sure how the ending is to be interpreted. I think this ambiguity is intended to mirror the prismatic nature of the crystals, that the plot lends itself to the same mirroring and reflection as the jewels themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In crystal, Ballard seems to have found the ideal apocalyptic substance, especially when he invents the rules for time and existence when people are crystallised. The central idea is that due to a leakage of time from the universe, all possible configurations of matter are being superimposed upon smaller and smaller amounts of physical space. (Let me have another hit on that bong now…) Ballard plays around with this superposition a lot, alongside the contrasts and comparisons that result as the refractions are observed. Relationships play out in love triangles (prisms, again!) and motives of individuals are replicated, mirrored and echoed throughout the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reading experience, TCW is the best from my Ballard list that I have read so far. It is well paced and provided you can get through rather the clinical and mundane opening half, you’ll be rewarded with a whole pile of batshit craziness that gets rattled off in part two. Ballard takes us into the crystal world, where we can watch in wonder as with words he makes prisms of our skins, our forests and or minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: I think I am going to take a bit of a Ballard break now. Next up is “Crash”. I have read it before, back when I was seventeen. I remember that I loved it (for salacious teenage reasons and with little knowledge back then of what the world is really like) but I am still a bit apprehensive about it. I may skip on to “Concrete Island”, I just haven’t quite made up my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #4: Substrata by Biosphere</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-04"/>
   <updated>2010-09-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-04</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/UC4add1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this album in the summer between my two years at college. I remember listening to this music under skies glowering with clouds so 1997 must have been a poor summer. I’d just bought a book of photography too, which placed photos from the north and south poles on opposite pages. I bought it mainly for the penguins that were, of course, on pretty much every other page. The pictures of snow and ice soon became the ideal companions to this album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1997, I was still finding my feet in terms of taste, so when I bought Substrata I knew that it would be aligned to my emerging thirst for all things ambient and electronic, but it was nonetheless something of a risk. This was before you could stream something off the internet, a time when you bought music out of curiosity because you thought you might like it, not out of guilt after you’ve pirated it because it turns out that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think with Substrata I had a good hunch. I grew to like it more and more as time went on. It is a splendid ambient album that, as you can infer from the pictures of icy mountain ranges plastered all over this post, has a distinctly Arctic theme&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It contains some lovely found sound too. I am a big fan of ambient music, but I find that found sound rarely works for me. I think that Substrata is the exception that proves my rule. I think that found sound tends to tip ambient music into somewhere a bit cheesy, into something not unlike those CDs of babbling brooks or jungle atmospheres that gather dust at the checkouts of health food stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-found-sound&quot;&gt;Beyond found sound&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioning found sound helps in the discussion of the music on the album, because it is only with the waterfall sound (anywhere else this would be cheesy) at the start of the third track “Chukhung” that you realise that something interesting is happening. The first two tracks set the scene with basic soundtrack work and lift-off is only happens once “Chukhung” starts to establish the mood: and I mean real, emotional mood. It’s not just glaciers and ice, polar bears and fir trees: you get a real sensation of being out in the wintry wastes and permanent darkness north of the Arctic circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is largely foreboding and darkness that looms over the initial tracks: “Chukhung” evolves over a strange corkscrew rhythm that seems to suggest looming grey clouds pregnant with snow; “The Things I Tell You” iterates over a sparse synth line that seems to emulate a mountain ridge, alternately bathed in light and obscured by mist; “Times When I Know You’ll Be Sad” seems to be a paean to seasonal affective disorder, though with jokey vocals and tongue firmly in cheek. The latter is perhaps the closest that Substrata gets to a song, but this is definitely an album of moods and impressions rather than a collection of songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/UC4add2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the album, tracks are built upon synth lines that pan left to right and back again, creating the impression of large flat circular landscapes. This minimalism is perfect for evoking polar scenery in the mind’s eye - one definitely imagines snowy wastes, ice sheets and dark pine forests, even if these are somewhat stereotypical ‘film stock’ images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-icy-heart-of-substrata&quot;&gt;The icy heart of Substrata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Substrata are two tracks that rely on killer spoken word samples&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Ambient music can often stand or fall on the choice of such extracts used to set the scene. As “Substrata” is largely instrumental, the use of samples in tracks about half way through the album provides a way-point for listeners that might get lost in largely instrumental pieces - just as my younger self did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sample features in the track “Hyperborea” and is from “Twin Peaks”. In it a man discusses a dream and before I looked it up on wikipedia, I was convinced that this was part of a hypnosis tape. It helps flesh out a minimal backing that, for me, evokes a pine forest: all the things described by the speaker emerge from the imaginary forest as though part of a shared dream. The second major sample underpins “Kobresia”, a track that hangs around your speakers like misty winter drizzle while a Russian psychic attempts to identify what is on a table in a room upstairs. Psychic viewing is brilliantly absurd, I remember watching a totally bat-shit movie at the Hayward gallery once in which large structures on the surface of Mars were described by such an individual. Is it delusion or simply someone with a brass neck? Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;out-into-the-wild-white-yonder&quot;&gt;Out into the wild white yonder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album drifts off into the snow and ice quite beautifully, though the final track “Silene” is of particular note. Found sound appears again and the track ends with some disturbing sounds of ice being broken up, melting, and cracking. It is difficult to tell whether it is a small amount of ice breaking up with a lot of force, or a whole vista of the stuff melting and slowly cracking up without any intervention at all. Either way it is a weird and fitting end to the album, indicating the release of the listener from the album’s icy grip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/other/UC4add3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I suppose I am distinguishing between found sound and vocal samples here. Perhaps there is very little difference, or that one is the other? When is a vocal snippet something more than found sound? Is it the fact that one has meaning? Isn’t a “meaningless” sample - like the ones here in Russian that I can’t understand - little more than found sound anyway? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. G. Ballard, The Drought</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-drought"/>
   <updated>2010-09-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-created-by-nature-versus-the-world-constructed-by-humans&quot;&gt;The world created by nature versus the world constructed by humans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to The Drought by J. G. Ballard in &lt;a href=&quot;/j-g-ballard/&quot;&gt;my ongoing quest to read and review all of his novels&lt;/a&gt;. This is his second novel, if we assume his convention of never acknowledging “The Wind From Nowhere” as being his first novel. “The Drought” itself was renamed from “The Burning World” and additional content added later on. This was quite common practice in SF in the 50s and 60s where novels were serialised in magazines like &lt;a href=&quot;http://philsp.com/mags/amazing_stories.html&quot;&gt;Amazing SF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttapress.com/interzone/about/&quot;&gt;Interzone&lt;/a&gt;. It is evidence though of Ballard finding his voice as he wrote and from The Drought it is easy to see that he is iterating his thought processes and subject matter with each novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Drought” is marvellous in a way that “The Drowned World” is not. Here Ballard has cut away much of the ropy science of that novel and left us with a much more realistic scenario of global drought without having to worry about all the outré trappings of giant iguanas and dragonflies the size of your head. Instead, all the magnetic and mesmerising elements of Ballard’s work are beginning to take form: the eccentric recluse with possible sinister intent, the confused and detached protagonist, the ambivalently regarded woman of standing, the encroachment of nature and the human tendency to defile pretty much all it touches, including all that it has constructed and lived alongside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action begins in the painful death throes of a drought that has caused those living further inland to escape to the sea. There is no rain and only some water, all mention of water assumes that there is a finite supply that will eventually be exhausted. The water cycle has been disrupted due to the sea being covered by a skin of monomeric compound that prevents evaporation, its presence due to industrial pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario is much more prescient than that presented in “The Drowned World” but it does not make “The Drought” any more of an ecological novel. It even blurs the line as to whether it is science fiction, instead it is more of a hallucinatory mirror held up to a suburban life that is left to quiver as though it were a mirage. There are a number of almost mythical characters and signifiers strung throughout the narrative. Quilter, the sinister autistic boy; Philip Jackson - a young boy who is a sort of cross between Peter Pan and Mowgli living alone and unsupported on the river; the mad Reverend; the madder millionaire Lomax, who sets off fireworks as an attention seeking gesture during fireworks; the widow who runs the zoo; a headless peacock; the Christian fish symbol scrawled into dust; a dead aquarium; fishermen who capture people with nets led by a man who dreams of a new river. (This will probably tie in with “Day of Creation” later on, so watch this space…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the takes place in a setting that might be familiar to us, a well-heeled suburb by a river. The church community, the zoo and the mansion belonging to Lomax all paint a picture of somewhere that would perhaps be idyllic in other circumstances. However, in the unrelenting sunlight and under the cloudless sky, with the soil turned to dust and the taps run dry, it is not the green-lawned and white-picked-fenced utopia we would like to imagine: it is instead abandoned and dusty and faded. Traditional roles have been skewed and everyone has a new agenda (p. 31):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Johnstone drummed a fist on the wheel. ‘That’s not for us to decide! There are too many people now living out their own failures, that’s the secret appeal of this drought. I was going to give the fellow some water Charles, but I wanted him to show some courage first.’
‘Of course’ Ransom said noncommittally. Five minutes earlier he had been glad to see Johnstone, but he realized that the clergyman was imposing his own fantasies on the landscape, as he himself had done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, packs of vigilantes move in, calling themselves “fishers of men” who are press-ganging people into a trip inland to find a river that they are convinced exists. Ransom comes to realise that the city must be abandoned (p. 60):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…he had realized that the role of the recluse and solitary, meditating on his past sins of omission like a hermit on the fringes of an abandoned city, would not be viable. The blighted landscape and its empty violence, its loss of time, would provide its own motives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In advance of the characters’ journey to the beach. Ballard foreshadows a description of what awaits them there with a description of what has happened to the fish that lived in the aquarium at the zoo. The description is marvellous and really captures the horror of the situation. The contrast between the terrible scene described and the beauty of the language used is really quite clever (p. 66):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Suspended in the dim air above him, their pearly bodies rotating like the vanes of elaborate mobiles, were the corpses of hundreds of fish. Poisoned by their own wastes, they hung in the gloomy water, their blank eyes glowing like phosphorous, mouths agape. In the smaller tanks the tropical fish effervesced like putrid jewels, their coloured tissue dissolving into threads of gossamer. Gazing at them, Ransom had a sudden vision of the sea by the coastal beaches, as clouded and corpse-strewn as the water in the tanks, the faces of the drowned eddying past each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, when reached, the beach is not the salvation it was thought to be (p. 115):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“He had expected the beach to be crowded, but not the vast concourse below, a meaningless replication of identity in which an infinite number of doubles of himself were being generated by a cancerous division of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially like that quote because I think it really sums up how difficult it is to feel empathy for others when part of a large crowd. In one sentence Ballard sums up the psychological basis for hatred of large crowds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the arrival at the beach, the story skips forward ten years with the main characters established on the beach, living out a harsh existence of harvesting water from the sea and living only on kelp and fish. The salt driven out of the sea has formed its own landscape and the sea itself has retreated further and further from the dunes. Ransom is isolated from the rest of the community, on the grounds that his negativity about the future is preventing him from working hard. However, when the corpse of one of the lions released from Mount Royal zoo is found dead, Ransom and friends realise that there must still be water inland and set off back to find it. Ballard uses the journey to explore what is a common theme in his books, that of whether our perception of the physical world around us is influenced by the mental world that we inhabit (p. 181):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The unvarying light and absence of all movement made Ransom feel that he was advancing across an inner landscape where the elements of the future stood around him like the objects in a still life, formless and without association.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall not say any more, as I do not want to spoil the ending. I really enjoyed “The Drought” probably as much as any other JG Ballard novel I’ve read. It’s “The Crystal World” next, but probably after a break to read something different, all this Ballard is making me thirsty for other writing!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #3: The Circle &amp; The Square by Red Box</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-03"/>
   <updated>2010-08-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-03</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-is-understated-not-understated&quot;&gt;When is understated not understated?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble with writing a series of articles all themed somehow is that eventually you might find something that sits naturally in the sequence but at the same time goes against the grain a little. Et voila, I give you “The Circle &amp;amp; The Square” by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redboxmusic.net/htm/home.htm&quot;&gt;Red Box&lt;/a&gt;. An album that hardly anyone has heard containing two top 10 UK singles that probably everyone has heard. Don’t get me wrong, it is a complete and utter classic - but it is definitely not understated: it is pompous, pretentious, ornate, artistic, all-encompassing, weird and awesome. I could continue but some innate inner law prevents me from using any more adjectives than that in one sentence. It is a chimeral entity standing way apart from its time, timeless and beautiful. The fact that it sold sod-all copies means that holding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cherryred.co.uk/cherrypop-exd.asp?id=873&quot;&gt;a CD remaster&lt;/a&gt; makes you feel as if you were clutching a cuddly dodo and thinking “if only, if only…”. So this barking, bonkers, beautiful album gets its “&lt;a href=&quot;/tags#understated-classics/&quot;&gt;understated classic&lt;/a&gt;” status because it just isn’t stated often enough just what an amazing record it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly, TC&amp;amp;TS is a wonderful object to hold in your hands. My parents own the original gatefold vinyl that folds out in all its glory in which each song is represented by some artwork and the lyrics are incorporated too. As with all great albums of the past you only have to examine the LP in its sleeve to realise that there is something else about this particular record, something special; think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/20/how-we-made-tubular-bells&quot;&gt;“Tubular Bells”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/what-is-dark-side-of-the-moon-about-15266894&quot;&gt;“Dark Side of The Moon”&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-led-zeppelin-four/&quot;&gt;“Led Zeppelin IV”&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that is unfortunately getting lost in the progression to CDs and downloads: the quality increases but the surrounding mystique is evaporating. The other nice bit of “recordness” with TC&amp;amp;TS is that it is structured as two sides - five songs and a short snippet on each side - about a forty-six minute runtime. The sides are obviously labelled “the circle side” and “the square side”; if I were pushed I would say that the “squarer” songs are on the square side but I am sure that was not their intention. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lewisslade.com/redbox/STC_INTERVIEW2003.html&quot;&gt;Note: Band leader Simon Toulson-Clarke said in an interview that there were a tribe of native Americans who symbolised their people as circles; when the Europeans came along with their square paddocks and square houses and (then) square money, they were represented by squares.&lt;/a&gt; This does actually make more sense in terms of the themes of the songs on each side of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;circle-side&quot;&gt;Circle side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album begins with the top 10 single “For America” (1986), apparently written as a sardonic reply to the record company who did not believe that the album was commercial enough. It certainly wears a smile with a tongue in its cheek and is an incredible earworm. I still hear it on commercial radio occasionally and it brightens up the room with its swirling drum beats and majorette backing vocals. This is followed by “Heart of the Sun”, essentially the title track and hardest for me to get when I was nine or ten years old. It does that pop lyric trick of inventing something philosophical and meaningful in searching for words that rhyme. If that sounds flippant, it isn’t, the lyric has obviously been slaved over in order to give it its proper due but every time I tried to reproduce a snippet of the lyric it looked incredibly pretentious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes “Billy’s Line” which always creeped me out and upset me when I was younger. I loved the keyboards and effects. The lyrics kind of touched me too: “Born in nineteen seventy seven / Will die in ninety five / A modern day statistic in collateral damage / Billy prays not to survive”. As someone born in 1980 and all too aware that 1995 was not far away, even though it seemed like the future, I think that really hit home.When I was younger, I used to want to meet a version of myself from the future (a bit like that Flaming Lips track) and learn about what life was really going to be like, to be told that every thing was going to be alright. All those things that I was supposed to do with my life: leave home, go to university, get married, get a job, have children and nurture them to adulthood. All of that seemed so far away and scary back then, some of it still does now. Those echoing synthpads, skeletal rhythms and haunting lyrics always accentuated that feeling of otherness within me, and when I listened to this song I always felt sad, but also special and different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing out that first side are “Bantu” and “Living In Domes”, two completely different tracks and yet somehow of a piece. I don’t how you would describe this kind of music really - it just seems to complex and intense to be mere pop music. These songs are immense and lovingly constructed, as much akin to a three minute pop single as a Ferrari is to a Kia hatchback. You can tell that both are cars, but the fact that one is so much better than the other does not necessarily mean that it can be universal. The songs on TC&amp;amp;TS don’t do whatever the musical equivalent of a trip to Tesco Express is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;square-side&quot;&gt;Square side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point is the first song on side two “Chenka Tenka (Io)”, which is accompanied on the reissue by the version issued on an independent label recorded about two years before TC&amp;amp;TS. The album version is full of chants, dreamy piano lines and violin across a break towards the end of the song that is genuinely (and not sentimentally) tear jerking. On the other hand, the single version is very much more energetic and is very much how you would imagine the song performed live, there’s slightly less of an elegiac tone but it definitely gets to the shops and back in its shorter span. The next song is their biggest hit “Lean On Me (ah-li-ayo)”, which you almost certainly have heard. It’s an awesome pop song (but maybe a dependable Golf rather than a Kia, to further stretch that ropey car metaphor) and appeals to that football chant mentality that makes you remember the words, with a chorus that’s as sticky as velcro. This probably succeeds better than any other on the album the sheer joy of singing in a group together that the so-called Box Vox must have felt while making this album. After that there’s a breathy near acapella rendition of “Saskatchewan”, a song originally recorded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://buffysainte-marie.com&quot;&gt;Buffy Saint-Marie&lt;/a&gt;, who I keep meaning to track down more music by. This was the one song I don’t like when I was younger but it has definitely grown on me over the course of 22 odd years. I think there might be a Cherry Red version of this too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into the final straight there are two great closing songs, it must have been hard to choose the order to put them in on the record. It is the classic mix-tape dilemma to my mind: sinister, then elegiac; or elegiac then sinister? They chose, wisely, to plump for the latter. The first of the couplet “Leaders In Seventh Heaven” has a brass band marching through it and is filled with a sadness for the passing of I don’t know what, it is quite beautiful and probably the most English of all the tunes on album. Perhaps it is the soundtrack of a wake for the empire, which would be beautifully ironic and bitter-sweet given the other songs on the album. That wonderful wavering line of “Aaaaand in between, all the things we might have been, oh let me, oh get me, thro-ooo-ough” - I dare you not to shiver! And so then, as the brass band and their snare drums trail away, we come to “Walk Walk”, a part sinister, part life-affirming choral plus synthesizer track. This is probably the one track with a real pulse and sense of the future within it. It definitely tries to rouse the listener and point the way towards walking and breaking into a run, that no matter what terrible things we might do, there is always some small decent part that prevails and survives: “We sing and we dance and we kiss each other!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amen&quot;&gt;Amen…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time that I have taken to write the praises of this album, I’ve tried to think about why it is so good, but also why you as a reader may not have heard of it. Was it simply a case of injustice, the record company unable to properly promote an album that was maybe a little ahead of its time? This might be the case, record companies have a history of chasing the lowest common denominator, while ignoring the highbrow and the slow burning. These days in the age of the internet (piracy aside), it is probably easier to make money from niches than it was back then. In the end though, there are no love songs on TC&amp;amp;TS - at least not love songs that describe love on a personal one to one level - and maybe that leaves it a little cold, perhaps a shade more brain than heart. All that can be said for certain is that even after the rush has ended and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador&quot;&gt;conquistadors&lt;/a&gt; are gone, in the dust and under the stones, some gold remains.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. G. Ballard, The Drowned World</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-drowned-world"/>
   <updated>2010-08-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-drowned-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-science-fiction-have-to-be-believable-to-be-meaningful&quot;&gt;Does Science Fiction have to be believable to be meaningful?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should science fiction have predictive power? In plotting the vast unknowns of the future, should authors aim for prescience? Will people be able to say of the best SF novels in five hundred years time that some novels were right about some things and that these novels are better than the ones that didn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say no, otherwise we would be remarkably unfair on an awful lot of good writing. That said, I doubt that SF is read for the futurology. As with all literature, SF is at it is best when it has something to say about the world around us now, no matter when it may be set. And if SF has any kind of predictive record, it does better when the psychological issues arising from continued technological development are considered over the mere technology of that advancement. In the long run, a fictional account of space dog Laika (does one exist?) that rings true emotionally will probably endure longer than a pulp novel entitled “Dogs In Space!” (though that is a great title!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, our very perception of the future is influenced by events as they happen. As a philosophical concept, the future has specific meaning to any given person or group of people at any given time. As a result, a ‘good’ prediction for the future is often grounded in a realistic description of the world as it is now or some universality of the human condition. “War of the Worlds” still has something to say today despite all of the wonky science precisely because it speaks to our innate fears of invasion and our fear that what lies beyond us may also lie beyond our capability to resist it. Asimov’s “Foundation” is interesting reading because the desire to present a way of reading the future and controlling political chaos emerges from the time that it was written with the cold war powers facing off, what better escapism than to a society of the future that shaking free from the various caprices of political ideology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does Ballard fare with &lt;em&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/em&gt;? Well, if you made a film of it, it would be full of Harryhausen claymation monsters, dodgy models of swamped metropolises and wooden acting performed on wobbly sound stages. It is a fantastic story but utterly utterly of its time. For a novel that sets time in amber with an apocalypse, the problem for the modern reader is that the wrong time is set in amber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have said, it is a ripping yarn and Ballard’s writing is excellent despite some rather dated tropes concerning societal mores and such. The science too is rather quaint, an increase in solar radiation has made the sun warmer, causing the ice caps to melt and the oceans to rise along with the temperatures. The resulting effect on flora and fauna is the rapid (re)establishment of Cretaceous era species, including giant iguanas and the like. This is rather risible but at this point, Ballard’s second novel, he is still thrashing out the means by which he will discuss the matters that are important to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the plot takes off only once a suitable human antagonist has been found for the character that Ballard has the reader invest in. It is only once the apocalypse has been swallowed up into the psyche that it starts to take on meaning (I’d say ‘to take on water’ but, dear reader, it’s a deadly pun) and so any attempt to posit “The Drowned World” as some sort of description or prediction of ecological disaster doesn’t really work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might save a discussion of the Strangman character until a bit later on, perhaps until after I’ve re-read “Crash”, and I would like to deal with the three apocalypses together in their own post once I have finished “The Drought” and re-read “The Crystal World”. I have a feeling that we’ll re-visit Kerans’ tropical haze over and over again too, there’s the stillness and inertia that I remember from the short stories, not to mention that euphoric conclusion. We will have to discuss at a later date too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #2: Sinking by The Aloof</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-02"/>
   <updated>2010-08-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-02</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-discovered-the-aloof-while-listening-to-the-top-40&quot;&gt;I discovered The Aloof while listening to the Top 40&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I used to listen to the Top 40 every Sunday. To begin with, this was partly an endurance thing and partly an obsession with one day seeing Roxette top the charts - alas, they never did, though for one thrilling spring “Joyride” did flirt with the upper reaches of the chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to the charts is probably the best way to become a lover of music. Nearly all my musical loves stem from listening to the top 40 chart, either directly from crouching next to my static-y radio on Sunday evening, or as something that evolving beyond those initial tastes later on. I soon realised that listening to music at the lower end of the chart was more rewarding and not just because this was where all &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Your_Heart&quot;&gt;the later Roxette singles ended up&lt;/a&gt;. It was where all the oddities washed in, sometimes there one week and never to be heard again - sometimes growing up into something big. I remember first hearing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prideofmanchester.com/music/ucc.htm&quot;&gt;“The Key The Secret” by the Urban Cookie Collective&lt;/a&gt; entering the chart at number 40, it eventually climbed to number 2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2004/11/20/entertainment_music_local_bands_kws_feature.shtml&quot;&gt;Also “Please Don’t Go” by KWS which crept all the way up to number 1&lt;/a&gt; - these were great dance records that grew by word of mouth at a time when great dance records were weird and new and meant something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I have a great story about listening to the nether regions of the top 40 on a Sunday evening. This is the hilarious tale of Bruno Brookes (or was it Mark Goodier?) &lt;a href=&quot;http://same-old-story.blogspot.co.uk/2004/05/literature_26.html&quot;&gt;playing the entirety of “Closer” by Nine Inch Nails&lt;/a&gt; - complete with coda consisting of the mantra “I want to fuck you like an animal” repeated for at least a minute. If Brookes (Goodier) was listening, one presumes that he wanted to curl up into a ball. It was the first time anyone at Radio 1 had bothered to listen to the record. People often wonder about whether records like this influence young children: well it totally corrupted me and I have loved swearing ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-night-stand&quot;&gt;One Night Stand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another track I found at the lower end of the charts (there must have been hundreds over the years) was “One Night Stand” by The Aloof. This is a magnificent record on which a swooping vocal describes the sordid fizzling out of an affair over glorious soundtrack strings and a crunching menacing bass loop. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/roasted_strawberry_and_82071&quot;&gt;Like strawberries and black pepper&lt;/a&gt;, it never seems like it should all gel together and yet somehow it does. Enter The Aloof then, a band of big ideas, sweeping vistas and, legend has it, insatiable appetites. Magnificently, the whole of “Sinking” is a post-party record that a) actually sounds as though there was one hell of a party the night before, and b) makes the after-party torture of hangover and regret seem more palatable than the party itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tracks&quot;&gt;The Tracks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sinking” starts with a rush of drums on “Bittersweet”, it’s either the sound of trains rushing past as you sit there in the bleached grey morning on the night before waiting for the train home, or the swirl of something in your stomach as you come down. Or both. The lyric tells tales of addiction and lust gone too far: “He stands rejected. He stands alone. She wants to break him: like he broke her happy home”. All the while those drums pound like nothing else and a piano line bleeds through, it’s a beautiful start to the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes the nine-minute slow burner “Stuck on the Shelf” in which a finger wagging narrator teases the listener that “you’ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan&quot;&gt;a mortgage on your back&lt;/a&gt;”. It sinuously weaves around telling the tale of a clubbing legend who has been saddled with a kid and responsibilities. The vocal is relentless, settling into a circling and seductive repetition of “Come on over here and have some fun”. It’s a real heartbreaker, thoughtfully constructed and most importantly, there are some excellent beats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is “Abuse”, which uses “Bittersweet” as a template but this time revels in self-abuse and self-destruction: “I drink until I drop and take whatever and whoever comes my way”. Two of the band were members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://warp.net/records/releases/the-sabres-of-paradise&quot;&gt;Sabres of Paradise&lt;/a&gt; and the Weatherall influence really comes through here, it has a very Two Lone Swordsmen vibe to it. The predominant beat sounds as though a helicopter’s thrum has been sped up, chopped up with rusty scissors and fed into a blender. It is the perfect counterpoint to a lyric obsessed with the “daily diet of abuse” and “not living for the future, just living for today”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this are “Wish You Were Here” and the title track. “Wish You Were Here” has a magnificent dub sound that undermines the treacly glockenspiel figure that repeats as the tune starts before settling into a wonderful groove pinned down by Portishead-esque spy soundtrack guitar. Trip-hop has become a dirty word but this track is pretty much the ne plus ultra of how to combine the elements associated with this sound in a compelling un-clichéd way. “Sinking” is a kinetic soundtrack piece with dark sub-vocalised whispers of malcontent “I wanted you to leave… the attraction had gone cold”. I don’t think it’s damning it with faint praise to say that it could effortlessly soundtrack a trailer for a gritty crime drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After “One Night Stand” (which is a glorious 8:57 in album form) are a couple of instrumentals: “Space Dust”, an upbeat kraftwerk-esque beat-fest with a lively little bass line that keeps everything going, and “Hot Knives At Teatime”, which perhaps shows off the Sabres lineage of the band most effectively. It’s a wonderfully moody piece with wonderful mirages of spaghetti western sounds. It somehow manages to match its title well and there’s something there in the middle that definitely makes me think of knives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album rounds off with “Losing It”, essentially “Bittersweet” told from the other angle as the world melts within your speakers, along with an instrumental version of “Sinking” (“Sunk”) and a wonderful instrumental version of “One Night Stand” (retitled as “The Last Stand”). When Lady Diana died, “The Last Stand” was the sweeping instrumental music that Radio 1 played on repeat for the best part of a week. It made the band more money than they had ever made, or have since. Their response: “When the Queen Mother dies, we’ll release it as a single… an orange 12” with a scratch and sniff smell of piss”. This tells you everything you need to know about this rather brusque and brutal band who with “Sinking” probably made one of dance music’s most beautiful and cohesive albums.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understated Classics #1: Together Alone by Crowded House</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/understated-classics-01"/>
   <updated>2010-08-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week Arcade Fire released their hotly anticipated third album “The Suburbs”.  I loved “Neon Bible” but critics found it preachy, as overbearing as the religious folk it sought to satirise. I do not agree and think that it was an impressive continuation from an exciting debut. “The Suburbs” steps on from their previous two albums, both in subject matter and tone. It’s sad, thoughtful, resigned, angry and tetchy - among other things. “The Suburbs” isn’t the understated classic that I want to discuss though: with all the praise and plaudits, it may never suit this new thread of posts. I want to write about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_Alone&quot;&gt;Together Alone by Crowded House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard The Suburbs, and especially the title track, I immediately thought of Neil Finn’s voice and Crowded House’s Together Alone album from 1993. Together Alone was the first Crowded House albums to work as a whole. It contributes a large number of tracks to their “best of”s for good reason. I think it deserves wider praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On re-listening, I realise that it bears no resemblance to the Arcade Fire album but I won’t let that deter me from my nostalgia trip. When we hear a really good new album, it drives us back to something as brilliant that we have lived in. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/music/Crowded+House/Together+Alone&quot;&gt;Together Alone&lt;/a&gt; supports this theory because I can’t think of an album that I have ‘lived in’ more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I believe that this album’s a classic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s full of singles. They released six and had at least three more to choose from. It’s easier to pick out the obvious non-singles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Together Alone” hangs together as a whole in a way that no other of their albums does. The production by Youth and Greg Hunter helps. It’s unfussy and uncomplicated for the most part (For a good example listen to “Locked Out”) but it’s also deep and delicate when it needs to be - for example the magnificent and creepy intro to “Private Universe”. The songs flow together one and the sounds used throughout feel consistent, it sounds great on headphones even seventeen years later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The content: dark and sexy. At this point the band were best known for “Don’t Dream It’s Over” and “Weather With You”, songs that tread a line between earnestness and whimsy. “Private Universe” at the start of its journey to a strange inner place even states: “no time no place to talk about the weather”. Everywhere oddness abounds: “we spilled a little dust on his Persian rug”, the entire lyric of “Pineapple Head” and “Walking On The Spot”. And what’s “Skin Feeling” all about? Your guess is as good as mine! Singles, spot-on production, sexiness, and darkness: that’s a recipe for a classic to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered the album when I borrowed the cassette version (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/08/tape-delay-after-years-in-the-musical-margins-cass.html&quot;&gt;remember those?&lt;/a&gt;) from the library (remember those?). I’d listen to it while wheeling around my village on my paper round (Newspapers? Remember those?). I can’t say I felt the same way about it then as I do now. I think its qualities and hidden depths have slowly revealed themselves to me over time. I know (a little) more about life than I did back then and life courses through the veins of these songs. And isn’t an album that grows with you the &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of an understated classic?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>J. G. Ballard</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/j-g-ballard"/>
   <updated>2010-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/j-g-ballard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading “Crash” at 17 left me in a state of numb shock. It got me hooked and left me with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard&quot;&gt;J. G. Ballard&lt;/a&gt; as one of my favourite authors. I then devoured a short story collection called “Myths of the Near Future” around the same time. You may recognise it because the Klaxons appropriated the title for their debut album. Those stories captured my imagination, in particular the eponymous story of a world gone to run amid “space sickness”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I tried “Concrete Island” and “High Rise” but couldn’t  willget into them. But I found “The Crystal World” much easier to follow. I’ve not read much of his long form fiction but I have waded through the complete collection of short stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though you can’t read books to order, I bought ten of his novels last week. They’re cheap on Amazon and Waterstone’s extended their three-for-two offer to all fiction paperbacks. I was keen to take on a range of books that cover Ballard’s career. I decided on these novels. The list links to the wikipedia page for each book but beware, those links will contain plot spoilers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Drought (AKA The Burning World)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Crystal World&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High-Rise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Unlimited Dream Company&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hello America&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Day of Creation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rushing To Paradise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I also bought the following later novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cocaine Nights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super-Cannes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kingdom Come&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can group the novels in different ways. I do this because I would like to write about the novels individually and collectively. I can’t offer deep textual analysis, just a gut reaction to the characters, scenarios and writing in these books. That, and how each novel relates to previous ones. My classification of the novels goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The apocalyptic novels&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Drought&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Crystal World&lt;/em&gt;. In these novels, the world undergoes a massive ecological change. Ballard casts us in the role of dispassionate observer, like Kerans in &lt;em&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/em&gt; and Sanders in &lt;em&gt;The Crystal World&lt;/em&gt;. Despite portraying a collapse of the physical world, the psychological effects of the events drive the story.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The concrete novels&lt;/strong&gt;: This sequence from the mid-70s (&lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;High-Rise&lt;/em&gt;) forms a loose trilogy. It sketches out a response to the concrete architecture and the motoring golden age of the late 60s and early 70s. As ever, a dark psychology lurks beneath. The protagonist of &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt; pursues Vaughan: a lunatic hell-bent on crashing his car into the limousine of Elizabeth Taylor. A car accident maroons a modern-day Robinson Cruse on that novel’s &lt;em&gt;Concrete Island&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;High-Rise&lt;/em&gt; begins with the central character’s contemplations “as he sat on balcony eating the dog”. In this trilogy, apocalypse does not ruin the world, rather people, celebrity, cars, and sex do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The euphoric novels&lt;/strong&gt;: You can sum up the remaining four as beginning with a euphoric act of creation setting events in motion. A plane crash in &lt;em&gt;The Unlimited Dream Company&lt;/em&gt;, an excursion to the ruined America (the apocalypse again, after the fact) in &lt;em&gt;Hello America&lt;/em&gt;, a third African river spontaneously forming in &lt;em&gt;The Day of Creation&lt;/em&gt; or the quest for ecological salvation in &lt;em&gt;Rushing To Paradise&lt;/em&gt;. The apocalypse resurfaces often but these novels also blend in elements of Ballard’s later writing: things like celebrity and exploring sexual psychoses arise again within this quartet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The divisions I impose between the novels may be artificial, but I hope they uncover plenty of stuff to write about. I will post about each novel as I read it.&lt;/p&gt;
