Humans have wanted to know the future for as long as there have been humans. As such, there has been a market for predicting the future for almost as long. This market grows more in times of uncertainty, at least when risk is perceived. In the present moment of global uncertainty there is a high demand for knowledge of what the future will bring.

This is the first in a series of posts about forecasting. The series as a whole will focus on the tools available to us, how to interpret the ways in which predictions and forecasts depend upon assumptions and data, and on how we might be able to scale back our dependence on predictions in the first place.

I say at the outset that my credentials are meagre. I have a PhD in mathematical biology, which had a focus on mathematical models for disease transmission, and yet I would still say that I am about as qualified to talk about our current situation as most other people. I have some experience in making predictions for a living, but if they were that good I would most likely be on a superyacht somewhere sunny rather than writing this post. That said, I hope I can explain the process of forecasting to an audience that might never have encountered it before.

Please note that I will not focus my examples wholly on epidemics. Understanding the forecasting process requires us to look at many different examples of where we might need a forecast, so that we can assess what data are available to us and begin to ask questions of that data. We will also need to ask questions about what we are forecasting that go beyond the data such as the purpose of the forecast and what we might do in possession of an accurate forecast.

Of course, “accurate forecast” is an oxymoron: the more that accuracy is critical to achieving success (or avoiding failure), the more likely it is you are going to be disappointed. This is one of those beautiful meta-facts about forecasting: the more wrong you can be, the better your prediction is likely to be. Forecasters use caveats the way artisans use detailing, as a demonstration of skill and craftsmanship. For ages my imposter syndrome made me think of caveats as bluster, that I was frantic Oz behind the screen. In fact, the caveats are often the most important aspect of the forecast.
