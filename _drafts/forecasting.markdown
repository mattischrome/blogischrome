Humans have wanted to know the future for as long as there have been humans. As such, there has been a market for predicting the future for almost as long. This market grows more in times of uncertainty, at least when risk is perceived. In the present moment of global uncertainty there is a high demand for knowledge of what the future will bring.

This is the first in a series of posts about forecasting. The series as a whole will focus on the tools available to us, how to interpret the ways in which predictions and forecasts depend upon assumptions and data, and on how we might be able to scale back our dependence on predictions in the first place.

I have some experience in making predictions for a living, but if my predictions were that good I might not be writing this post. That said, I hope I can explain the process of forecasting to an audience that might never have encountered it before. These posts are also about helping me to make predictions when called upon to do so. As a result, I may skip over some topics that I feel confident in, but you can get in touch with me if I've skimmed over something that you want a better explanation for. I'm easy to find. 

I will not focus all my examples on epidemics. Understanding forecasting requires us to look at many examples of where we might need a forecast, so we can assess what data are available to us and begin to ask questions of that data. We also need to ask questions that go beyond simply what we are forecasting: such as the purpose of the forecast and what we would do in possession of an accurate forecast.

Of course, “accurate forecast” is an oxymoron: the more that accuracy is critical to achieving success (or avoiding failure), the more likely it is you are going to be disappointed. This is one of those beautiful meta-facts about forecasting: the more wrong you can be, the better your prediction is likely to be. 

Caveats are essential to forecasts. Forecasters use caveats the way artisans use detailing, as a demonstration of skill and craftsmanship. At first they can seem like excuses for why your forecast won't ring true, but they will in fact allow you to highlight the areas where the forecast does work. Caveats are an important element of the dialogues that exist in production of forecasts.
