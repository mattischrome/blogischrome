Washington Black is Esi Edugyan's third novel and her second to be shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. It's about a young slave - the eponymous Washington Black - who lives on a Barbados sugar plantation run by a dysfunctional English familiy. Washington, nicknamed Wash, is taken on as an assistant by Titch the younger brother of Erasmus Wilde, the cruel runner of the plantation. 

Titch is building what is in essence a zeppelin and needs Wash as a light enough pilot. From there events take a series of bizarre twists and the odd pair end up on the run from the plantation in Barbados.

This book sat on the bookshelf for many years. It's a beautiful hardback edition by [Serpent's tail][1], I'd pick it up now and then at which point it would re-join my "to read" pile. Recently we've bought and built some new IKEA book shelves and I had another encounter with it, deciding this time that I would actually read it. 

I find slavery to be an uncomfortable subject to read about. It is difficult to read about such harrowing things for pleasure, especially when its effects continue to shape the world we live in and that I am sitting there as the descendent of those who profited (and continue to profit) from it. That said, art can help us acknowledge the lives that were lost to slavery and point us toward the possibility of a better world.

## Notes for the rest of the review...
Learning to rise above the actions of others - Wash develops agency in different levels, at first seeing salvation as something he receives from others at first but finding it in himself and for others by the novel's end
Exposing all of Titch's foibles - Wash is convinced he needs to save Titch but realises that he doesn't need to and should save himself instead
Does Wash have foibles of his own?
What is the future for Wash at the end of the novel?
Is the sheer distance that Wash covers unrealistic, or does it just seem that way post-covid?!?
snow described as "the obliterating ferocity of whiteness"
this novel lost out to Milkman, which is a very difficult read written as a stream of consciousness in dialect with very few named characters - milkman deals with the effects of sectarian violence on women, something perhaps more understandable than the traumatic after effects of slavery - both novels allow us to see a "solved" problem (Northern Ireland is at 'peace', the slaves are 'free') as unsolved, or at least as a new set of unfolding problems
I like this novel more as it sets out a happy ending for its hero and develops layers of agency for him, but then I didn't finish Milkman so it's not a fair comparison
