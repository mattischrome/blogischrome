This is an album I borrowed from a friend once I realised that it had the song "A Minor Place" on. Fanfarlo had covered this song and I'm big fans of theirs, so I wanted to check out the original version of the song and the album from whence it came. This is because, and I don't know if you noticed, I'm an albums kinda guy.

Needless to say, this is another album picked out by my script that I haven't listened to much. I feel at this point that maybe I should be biasing my selections towards albums that I listen to more often but the ins and outs of why it would be difficult would make for a separate blog post, and a rather dull one at that. The long and short of it is that there are four eras in my music collection: pre-computer (i.e. no data at all), pre-streaming (one data set), Spotify era (2013 - they started handing money to vaccine deniers), and the Apple Music streaming era (2020 to present day). Not all of those eras have equally good data - Spotify might be an awful awful company but at least they made it slightly easier to track my listening with Last.fm than Apple Music does. 

Anyway, "A Minor Place" aside, this is essentially like the Ellie Goulding album for me. Except I didn't buy this album for my mum, so I might like it a bit more. To be honest this was the first selection of the album selector and I did run it a couple more times, but it made even more esoteric choices along with another Fabric compilation, so this was the album I decided to go with. Let's see how I go.
