Big Thief are a band from the US, and "Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You", a double album released in February, is their fifth.

I'd noticed Big Thief steadily getting great reviews on Pitchfork, and when the reviews for "Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You" suggested a double album that was all over the place and full jarring transitions, I thought "that sounds like the white album", and decided that I was down for it.

I mean, look at that cover, it's like someone drew a cosy band scene on the cover of someone's copy of "The Beatles". It definitely does on the *actual* vinyl version, which might be a bit of a spoiler for whether or not I enjoyed this album or not.
