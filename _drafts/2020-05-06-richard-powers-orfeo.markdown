Having enjoyed [The Overstory](/the-overstory/) so much I decided to investigate a few more of Richard Powers' novels. Orfeo, another Booker longlisted effort, had been on my radar for a while. Its themes have often pinged at me: music, how one should spend a life, and how one should express one's personal freedom in a world threatened by terrorism. In fact a lot of these are recurring themes in Powers work and will be familiar to anyone who has read The Overstory.
