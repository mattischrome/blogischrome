> "The mind may give up its desire to improve on creation and function as a faithful receiver of experience." John Cage

After enjoying [_The Overstory_,][1] I wanted to read more of Richard Powers' novels. _Orfeo_  was also long listed for the Booker prize. Perhaps more of his novels would have been had the prize been opened to American authors earlier.

_Orfeo_ is about Peter Els, a seventy year old composer who accidentally alerts Homeland Security to the existence of his home laboratory, in which he has been trying to recode the genetic material of a bacterium. to include a piece of his music. He end

The themes of _Orfeo_ have often pinged at me:
* music
* how should one spend a life? 
* how can one express one's personal freedom in a world threatened by terrorism?

A lot of these ideas will be familiar to anyone who has read _The Overstory_. But it also turned out to be a fascinating read for the current times. Ordinarily, Orfeoâ€™s microbial sub-plot would provide ample subtext for discussion of â€˜catchyâ€™ tunes, but in the midst of the current pandemic itâ€™s a little spooky.

Modern music is not just obscure because it is written by weirdos with no new moves to pull off, but also because we as listeners have been drawn into comfort zones by the 'greats' and find it very hard to accept new and different ideas. 

Beauty over truth love emotion

Hearing resonances in notes. How characters and lives are also built up from resonances of their experiences but also how the audience 'hears' them. 

This could in essence be another book about writing. The competing desires to experiment with form and to tell a good story. Can you do both? This novel perhaps might easily have been one of those dreadful novel as tweets, but it seems that Powers can't help but resist showing us the wiring behind the board.  

An excellent novel to read in the midst of a global pandemic!

The desire to leave something in the world, but not necessarily a need for the world to know it's there. Comparison to music composed in a concentration camp, composed under threat of totalitarianism, composed out of discarded messages by the roadside, coded out of weird geometries and harmonics inaccessible to less studious listeners. The desire to feel a single irreducible and unrepeatable moment, to know something fleeting if only for an instant. To create something that makes you more than yourself.
