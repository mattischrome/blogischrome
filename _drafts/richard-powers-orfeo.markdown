> "The mind may give up its desire to improve on creation and function as a faithful receiver of experience." John Cage

Having enjoyed [The Overstory][1] so much I decided to investigate a few more of Richard Powers' novels. Orfeo, another Booker longlisted effort, had been on my radar for a while. Its themes have often pinged at me: music, how one should spend a life, and how one should express one's personal freedom in a world threatened by terrorism. In fact a lot of these are recurring themes in Powers work and will be familiar to anyone who has read The Overstory.

Modern music is not just obscure because it is written by weirdos with no new moves to pull off, but also because we as listeners have been drawn into comfort zones by the 'greats' and find it very hard to accept new and different ideas. 

Beauty over truth love emotion

Hearing resonances in notes. How characters and lives are also built up from resonances of their experiences but also how the audience 'hears' them. 

This could in essence be another book about writing. The competing desires to experiment with form and to tell a good story. Can you do both? This novel perhaps might easily have been one of those dreadful novel as tweets, but it seems that Powers can't help but resist showing us the wiring behind the board.   

An excellent novel to read in the midst of a global pandemic!

The desire to leave something in the world, but not necessarily a need for the world to know it's there. Comparison to music composed in a concentration camp, composed under threat of totalitarianism, composed out of discarded messages by the roadside, coded out of weird geometries and harmonics inaccessible to less studious listeners. The desire to feel a single irreducible and unrepeatable moment, to know something fleeting if only for an instant. To create something that makes you more than yourself.
