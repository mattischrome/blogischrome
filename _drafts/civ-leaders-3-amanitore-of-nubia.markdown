Amanitore of Nubia is available in a base game DLC. She also has her own scenario ‚ÄúThe Gifts of the Nile‚Äù, which is instructive in the revamp of the religion system that occurred a few patches into the base game. You can also play the scenario as Cleopatra for a different perspective.

## Civ ability
*Ta-Seti* +50% Production toward Ranged units. All Ranged units gain +50% combat experience. Mines over strategic resources provide +1 Production. Mines over bonus and luxury resources provide +2 Gold.

## Leader bonus
*Kandake of Mero√´* +20% Production towards all districts rising to +40% if there is a Nubian Pyramid adjacent to the City Center.

## Unique improvement
The *Nubian Pyramid*, an improvement that unlocks with Masonry and must be built on Desert, Desert Hills or Desert Floodplains. It provides +1 Faith and receives additional yields from adjacent districts (e.g. +1 Science if adjacent to a Campus). It receives +1 Food if adjacent to a city center. Unlike many unique tile improvements, Nubian Pyramids can be built next to one another.

## Unique units
Amanitore has one unique unit, the *Pitati Archer*. It is stronger than a regular archer and has one extra movement point per turn. This can be a major advantage when waging early wars on desert terrain.

## Victory types and play style
Religion is key here. If the map is covered in desert, you might not get the Desert Folklore pantheon, but Nubian pyramids can compensate. Her bonuses for mines mean pantheons like Religious Idols (add extra faith to your existing bonus) or God of Craftsmen (make mines on strategic resources great as well) are good backups. You can use the Feed The World follower belief and/or the Gurdwara religious building to produce food in desert cities. An early Exodus of the Evangelists golden age secured on building a Pitati Archer (research Aninmal Husbandry then Archery) and a Nubian Pyramid (research Mining then Masonry), should be possible. This combined with the Missionary Zeal enhancer belief should get your religion spread far and wide. Or you could take the Crusade enhancer belief and splat your near neighbours with Pitati archers after you've converted them.

A strong religious start always helps later in the game.

## Possible problems


## What to expect if you're playing against an AI Amanitore
She gets a bit irate if you haven't built enough districts in your cities. Nubian pyramids help her expand into desert areas and I've noticed that she settles a lot of cities. She will also often use a Pitati Archer rush to conquer nearby city states, but rarely declares war on neighbouring civs. At higher AI levels, the difference between your ability to build districts and that of your fellow AI players will mean she will buddy up to them and starting narking on you.

While a human player might use her abilities to place a bias on religion, the AI Aminatore rarely does this overtly. Expect a flurry of missionaries as is often the case with the AI, but late on she will prefer to use the Grand Maester's Chapel to pump out combat units. 

## Conclusion
If you're rolling a new game and randomly get Amanitore as your leader, rejoice for you will have awesome archers. Aim for an early religion and early golden ages, pump out the desert wonders and use your archers to back up your religious expansion.
