Amanitore of Nubia is available in a base game DLC. She also has her own scenario ‚ÄúThe Gifts of the Nile‚Äù, which is instructive in the revamp of the religion system that occurred a few patches into the base game. You can also play the scenario as Cleopatra for a different perspective.

## Civ ability
*Ta-Seti* +50% Production toward Ranged units. All Ranged units gain +50% combat experience. Mines over strategic resources provide +1 Production. Mines over bonus and luxury resources provide +2 Gold.

## Leader bonus
*Kandake of Mero√´* +20% Production towards all districts rising to +40% if there is a Nubian Pyramid adjacent to the City Center.

## Unique improvement
The *Nubian Pyramid*, an improvement that unlocks with Masonry and must be built on Desert, Desert Hills or Desert Floodplains. It provides +1 Faith and receives additional yields from adjacent districts (e.g. +1 Science if adjacent to a Campus). It receives +1 Food if adjacent to a city center. Unlike many unique tile improvements, Nubian Pyramids can be built next to one another.

## Unique units
Amanitore has one unique unit, the *Pitati Archer*. It is stronger than a regular archer and has one extra movement point per turn. This can be a major advantage when waging early wars on desert terrain.

## Victory types and play style


## Possible problems


## What to expect if you're playing against an AI Amanitore
He‚Äôs going to declare war on you sooner or later. He doesn‚Äôt like you if you‚Äôre not at war with your neighbours. He might be a pretty boy but stay safe: build pikemen.

## Conclusion
If you're rolling a new game and randomly get Amanitore as your leader, rejoice for you will have awesome archers.
