Wow - I think I always had ambitions of making it to forty understated classics posts but I don't think I realised how long it would take me to get there. It's taken nearly twelve years at this point. Admittedly, at the start I knocked out about twelve in the first year (post 12 arrived a year and fourteen days after the official start date of this blog)

The reason I've chosen a selection of songs (a playlist?) rather than a specific album is because of the role that these songs have played in my life. There's a mixture sprinkled over several years and several singles, and while many of the Pet Shop Boys' albums are fine enough to stand as classics in their own right, they're usually either understated or classic, whereas I'd hope the particular songs I have chosen are more like both. 

Terms like queerness and bisexuality are ones that I've had to learn to use. The two biggest problems with section 28 (and there are many many more) were the denial of that learning and the relentless othering that it enabled. 

Under section 28 there was no one to turn to, to ask about why you felt a particular way, or to inform about something creepy happening to you. There was no way to bloom or flourish. Nothing. If you were on any part of that spectrum that wasn't "normal" you just didn't talk about it. 

Punk as a movement invited aggression towards otherness
