Gorgo of one of two Greek leaders available in the Civ VI base game.

## Civ ability
*Plato's Republic* One extra Wildcard policy slot in any government. This is amazing because diplomatic and wildcard slots only open up at Level 1 governments for most civilizations. And even when those civs get there, you're still going to have one extra slot. And because it's a wildcard slot, that's the most useful extra slot to have. It's essentially a free Forbidden City wonder about four eras before you can build the Forbidden city.

## Leader bonus
*Thermopylae* Combat victories provide Culture equal to 50% of the Combat Strength of the defeated unit. This can be incredibly useful, to the extent that you can start harvesting barbarians for culture early on in the game. Culture gets you through the civics tree, which grants more cards for you to use in your extra wildcard slot. Culture also helps you to spread your borders, so you can grab extra hexes on the map without having to pay for them. 

## Unique district
The *Acropolis*, a district unique to Greece that replaces the Theater Square district. It is cheaper to build and awards 1 Envoy when completed. It gets the same adjacency bonuses as the standard theatre square

+1 Culture bonus for adjacent City Center. +1 Culture bonus for each adjacent wonder and district. Can only be built on Hills.

## Unique unit
Gorgo has one unique unit, the *Hoplite*. It is stronger than a regular spearman and gets +10 combat strength from being next to another Hoplite unit.
