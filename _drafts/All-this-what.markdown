# All this... what?!
As we slip over the peak and beyond the golden age; I'm starting feel a nostalgia for past highs, together with a sadness for those growing up in our wake who will not experience the like of those heady times. 

Twenty years ago it was possible to use the internet to find out pretty much anything, to connect to any community or interest, and to stake out your own place on that wild frontier. Now I appreciate that this was a lot easier if you were a white western male in his late teens or early twenties, but even so large numbers of people from previously hidden communities came into view and could be acknowledged by a prevailing culture that had previously subjected them to erasure. I was there to look and learn and see, and while sometimes I fear I may have been deaf to some of the conversations going on around me, I like to think that I did learn and that I continue to see. 

The problem was that back then technology was expensive. It still is, but those costs have been shifted into ecological destruction and the dismemberment of personal autonomy. The people running the show had people standing behind them forking over wheelbarrows of cash who at the same time whispered: so, how does this stuff make us even more money?
