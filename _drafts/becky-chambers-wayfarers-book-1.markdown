"The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet" is the first novel by Becky Chambers in her Wayfarers' series, a science fiction series about humanity's entry into a wider galaxy of species and civilisations who are already 'out in the open'. I'm writing this review because I've recently finished reading "The Galaxy and The Ground Within", the last novel in the sequence. I enjoyed that book so much that I decided to start the whole sequence over again. 

Brief description of plot

When I first read this book - Australia 2018

What it was like to read again

The importance of books that tell us our future is not going to be an impossible struggle. Not just important, but realistic.

We can also see ourselves in the wonderful aliens that Becky has invented.
