Well, it's been a while since I wrote [my last Civ VI leader post about Amanitore of Nubia](/civ-leaders-3-amanitore-of-nubia) and there's been a whole host of new leaders and personas added to the game since then. Among these the number of Chinese leaders has increased from two to five. Therefore it's probably a good time to start writing about one of them, and where better to start than the OG himself, Qin Shi Huang. The recent leader pass has created a new persona for him but today we shall focus on his original version, which is now referred to in-game as his "Mandate of Heaven" persona.

China is mostly set up for large amounts of culture and gold, with a number of unique units and tile improvements which provide additional defence. This version of Qin Shi Huang was available in the base game at launch and he's always been fun to play.

## Civ ability

 Eurekas and Inspiration Inspirations provide an extra 10% of the Science Science and Culture Culture cost for researching technologies and civics. Completing a Wonder grants a Eureka Eureka and Inspiration Inspiration from that Wonder's era.
 
 The additional boost to eurekas and inspirations appears small at first reading, but it really adds up over the course of a game. You can play as any Chinese leader and keep in touch with the AI on the tech and civic trees. Best of all, it keeps going throughout the whole game, so you're still get extra boosts on the more difficult later on that you have to obtain with spies. That also goes for the boosts that you get from building wonders (which obviously goes well with Qin's leader ability). 

## Leader bonus

All builders gain one extra charge. Builders can expend one charge to give 15% of the production towards ancient or classical wonders. Canals are available from Masonry onwards.

The extra build charge is great - it means more sections of great wall, more attempts at pushing wonders, more farms, more strategic resources. These all add up over the course of the game. If you're able to build the Pyramids (one of the wonders you can rush with a builder), you'll have five charges. With Liang and the Serfdom and Public Works policy cards, you can get this up to eight charges on your builders. This combines nicely with the Royal Society building if you decide to go for a science victory. 

Needless to say, rushing wonders is great, though it can come at an opportunity cost to early expansion. (That said, if you have met some other civs and know one of them has nearly finished a wonder, you could dump some builder charges in to building that wonder even though you're not going to catch up, dumping the inevitable overflow into a settler - effectively turning builder charges into settlers)

Those early canals are _very_ early canals, so it looks like an underwhelming bonus at first, mostly because canals are pretty expensive to build at any time, let alone in the ancient era. But no one else can build canals until the industrial era, so that's a long time to be able to build them ahead of your rivals. It's very situation-specific, but it's not out of the realms of possibility that it could be useful. 

## Unique improvement

All Chinese leaders can build the Great Wall tile improvement. Occupying units receive +4 Strength Defense Strength and automatically gain 2 turns of fortification (+6 Strength Defense Strength). The tile receives +2 Gold and +2 Gold for each adjacent Great Wall. With the Castles technology each Great Wall tile receives +2 Culture for each adjacent Great Wall. With the Flight technology, each Great Wall tile provides tourism equal to its culture output. Great Walls can be pillaged by disasters but never removed by them. No corners or junctions can be built into Great walls. 

The Great Wall is an amazing tile improvement, the culture that they generate after flight can save a game if you are behind culturally, or, in the more likely scenario that you are barelling on toward a culture victory, it will give you an extra push on the way. 

## Unique unit

Qin - and all the Chinese leaders - have one unique unit. This is the Crouching tiger, a ranged unit that appears at the Machinery tech.

Compared to the Great Wall, the Crouching Tiger is a little bit of a disappointment. It appears at the same time as crossbows but has less range. They don't replace crossbows per se, but rather augment them. The shorter range is limiting for offensive missions but the crouching tiger does have +10 ranged combat strength. They also work well with the garrison promotion that awards an extra +10 ranged combat strength when receiving a defensive bonus (e.g. while standing on a section of great wall). They are also quicker to build, which also makes them useful for cranking out if you receive a surprise war declaration. For offensive operations you could (and probably should) still build crossbows.

Another interesting aspect of the Crouching Tiger is that it is a standalone unit, there's no other unit that upgrades into it. Your archers will still become crossbows. This means that it is sometimes possible to forget about them and miss out on the associated era score.
