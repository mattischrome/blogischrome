Time for another post in my *very* occasional guide to the Civ VI leaders. Gorgo is one of two Greek leaders available in the Civ VI base game, as part of an exhibition of how one Civ could have two leaders. The differences in the two leaders can lead to very different outcomes in your game. Gorgo turns Greece into a more warlike civilisation.

Pericles is the other Greek leader. We'll get to him eventually. (Probably in about 2042 at this rate.)

Note: this guide and all subsequent guides will reflect the changes made to the game in the April 2021 patch. Of the Civs I have covered so far, there are only minor changes.  For [Japan][1], the samurai is a little bit easier to get hold of thanks to the introduction of additional melee units (but is a little less useful as a result). This same change impacts on [Alexander's][2] unique units as well. For [Nubia][3], the ranged unit production boost is nerfed to +30% rather than +50%. The current patch has the hint of being a final underline in terms of major changes but I'm not intending to change those posts for the time being. However, I have added a note to each of those posts. 

## Civ ability
*Plato's Republic* One extra Wildcard policy slot in any government. This is amazing because diplomatic and wildcard slots only open up at Level 1 governments for most civilizations. And even when those civs get there, you're still going to have one extra slot. And because it's a wildcard slot, that's the most useful extra slot to have. It's essentially a free Forbidden City wonder about four eras before you can build the Forbidden city.

If you're well place for a religious game, you can use that slot to boost your great prophet points with the Revelation card as soon as you've researched mysticism. This is way ahead of any tier 1 government and you as a potential cultural powerhouse will probably reach this point ahead of other civs anyway. 

Gorgo's start bias is for hills and as a result you can spawn near lots of mountains and geothermal vents, which you can also use for a good science start. In this situation you can beef up your first few campuses by taking the inspiration card (+2 great scientist points per turn) nice and early. 

## Leader bonus
*Thermopylae* Combat victories provide Culture equal to 50% of the Combat Strength of the defeated unit. This can be incredibly useful, to the extent that you can start harvesting barbarians for culture early on in the game. Culture gets you through the civics tree, which grants more cards for you to use in your extra wildcard slot. Culture also helps you to spread your borders, so you can grab extra hexes on the map passively without having to pay for them.

Your units also get +1 combat strength for every military policy slot in your government. This is handy, especially with the extra wildcard slot that you have available to you.

## Unique district
The *Acropolis*, a district unique to Greece that replaces the Theater Square district. It is cheaper to build and awards 1 Envoy when completed. It gets the same adjacency bonuses as the standard theatre square, but acts like a Government Plaza with respect to districts. This means it's pretty easy to get high adjacency theatre squares. However, it can only be built on hills.

## Unique unit
Gorgo has one unique unit, the *Hoplite*. It is stronger than a regular spearman and gets +10 combat strength from being next to another Hoplite unit. The biggest problem is cranking these out quickly while they are useful. I don't really tend to build spearmen unless I'm faced with an AI army of horsemen at my city gates so I don't  have any tips for how to do this.

## Victory types and play style
The obvious choice is domination. You have strong early troops and you can add combat strength by picking as many military policy cards as possible. That way you can establish a lot of infrastructure without having to build too many cities of your own. 

Another option might be a culture victory. Though the acropolis does limit placement of theatre districts somewhat, the extra adjacency bonuses to districts can help. That said, by building acropolises on hills you also have to forego the production you could have gotten out of a mine on that same tile. Moreover, given how hills cluster on most maps you might also lose more mines if you start building wonders and other districts around your acropolises to boost their adjacency bonuses.

If you build an acropolis next to the city centre, you also get an envoy. Therefore it's possible for you to become suzerain of city states quite early, especially when combined with the card that makes your first envoy worth two envoys. Depending on the city states you influence (for example scientific or religious city states), you might also be able to pivot toward another victory type. And if someone else takes over, declare war on the city state and capture it instead!

## Possible problems
You could end up with no one to fight. Even barbarians won't spawn much if you have lots of troops as they tend to show up in areas covered by the fog of war. 

Units are expensive to maintain, especially if you've built a few hoplites in order to take advantage of their high-powered adjacent unit bonuses. In the early game before you get more trade routes, a good gold income is useful to maintain but anti-cavalry troops can be a rather expensive luxury.

The imbalance towards culture can make it harder to progress through the tech tree. That said, finishing a civic with a barb kill can really help you get toward new governments and new policy cards all the quicker. The extra wildcard slot also means that you'll stand a good chance of being able to use them.

That said, it's hard for civs with classical era bonuses to stay ahead. It's true of Alexander and Aminatore as well. Remember that you'll be left with a somewhat vanilla civ whose advantages won't keep you ahead forever. 

## What to expect if you're playing against an AI Gorgo
The other way leaders can dramatically change play style is through their agenda. This doesn't impact you when you play *as* Gorgo but will impact how you play against her. She really wants you to be at war with somebody and will berate you for not doing so (similar to [Alexander][4]). 

In games that have featured an AI Gorgo, I have not noticed her snowball culture in the way that Pericles does. This is probably because her agenda motivates her to declare war on neighbours and city states, and war tends to drain resources in AI players.

Generally Gorgo is not too problematic unless you spawn next to her. If you do, it might be best to prioritise researching the technologies needed to build walls (Masonry, Castles) and for a counter-offensive, build plenty of siege units. 

## Conclusion
Gorgo is fun to play as, even if the promise of her hoplites and the culture from defeating enemy units ends up being a nice-to-have rather than something that wins the game.
