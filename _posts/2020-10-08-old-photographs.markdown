Recently I've had cause to dig out some old photos. If I'm honest it's made me sad. Sadder than I was expecting. There's a quote from Nan Goldin that once felt like a warning but now just sounds like a sad statement of ongoing affairs:

> “I used to think that I could never lose anyone if I photographed them enough. In fact, my pictures show me how much I’ve lost.”

Goldin took pictures of people in trouble. The people in her pictures were often in trouble, victims of circumstance who were in over their head. We saw an exhibition of her photos in the Tate Modern last year, they were windows into other lives that bordered on the uncomfortable: the viewer of a photograph is always in the privileged position of owning its narrative, no matter how well the photographer has framed it. 

The people in the photos I looked through were often not in any kind of trouble. Most of the pictures on this occasion weren't even taken by me. Some stretched back over a hundred years, snaking back up the branches of the family tree. Others contain friends and former lovers.

I guess in the present time and moment all these memories represent lost branches of a tree that has grown up through my life. And now, confronted with these leaves that are fallen on to paths not taken, it seems as though that same tree is somewhat diminished and withered.

Of course, the tree survives. But there are still questions like “what if?” You just have to remember that these are questions that can still be answered, even if those answers aren’t the same as you might once have wanted them to be. You can’t leap into bed with old lovers (well, you might be able to) but you can still say hello. People may have died, but you can still connect to those they have left behind and they will be grateful for the reminiscence.

If the photos that cause you regrets are of far off places, write about them. If they are of happier times, tell someone about them. Relive the feelings, the places and the people. Reading these words now it might seem like a stupid idea, but it does help.
