## Travel

In 2023, it was Germany or go home.

Went to Cologne in January. Here is photographic evidence:

We took the Eurostar via Brussels. A bit of a long day on the way back but much less stressful compared to flying.

Went to Berlin in July. Here is photographic evidence:

We flew with Easyjet. It feels like everything has fallen apart compared to pre-Brexit. (A flight to and from Germany in 2019 was pretty mediocre too, so it's not just the pandemic.) Anyway, the train is way better - but would have also taken about 15 hours and been a lot slower. 

But Berlin was lovely. It was the tail end of a long heatwave, so the whole city felt drawn out and tired. Coming in from the non-event of a British summer this year it felt exciting. And of course, Berlin is so many places all in one place. A bit like London but with fewer wankers.

Closer to home, we went to Jane Austen's house in September. Here is photographic evidence:

I probably need to travel more in 2024, but as mentioned above, it seems so difficult right now.

## Books

Three books/series I liked in 2023:

1. Book 1
2. Book 2
3. Book 3

## Work

There was evolution rather than revolution at work. My direct report left us for a better job, whilst my own role was upgraded and put into alignment with some very talented colleagues. The chance to regularly discuss work with them has definitely been a change for the better.

I keep learning new things, but don't seem to get much chance to apply them. This means that new techniques don't seem to stick like they used to. I'm going to try and make a difference to that in 2024.

What would my dream job be? I'm well into my forties and I still don't know. I probably won't figure it out any time soon!

## Things I Watched

* Drops of God
* Foundation season 2
* Drive My Car
* Strange Way of Life

## Continued adventures in blogging

Integration of git and SSG is fun.

I still need to learn more CSS though.

I am still very distrustful of JavaScript frameworks (React etc) and of JS generally. That is probably changing but I do need to give myself more chances to find out what I can do, and that means actually doing things.

As for writing, it's fun. And despite things like Chat-GPT, it's never been more important to think and write, to write and think.

## What I want to do more of in 2024

Finish things.

Take more photos.

Make more of a difference in the world. It doesn't have to be huge, it just has to be something.

Do more coding.
