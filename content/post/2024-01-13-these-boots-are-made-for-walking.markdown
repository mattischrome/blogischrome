I bought some new shoes today. Can recommend Cotswold Outdoor in Chichester: good selection of shoes and boots, helpful staff, and a national trust discount.

I ended up buying the same boots as I normally do, but in a wide fit instead of a normal. For some reason, the last pair I bought were very narrow and I had to switch to other shoes. Anyway, I was able to try both bigger and wider shoes (thus giving Ingrid plenty of time to make her decisions), settling on the same size but wider.

Walking shoes are important. There's a really nice 5km circuit over to the next village that I find really helpful to my wellbeing. Unfortunately most of the route is a bit marshy at the moment, but I'm looking forward to giving the new shoes a go on that route soon.
