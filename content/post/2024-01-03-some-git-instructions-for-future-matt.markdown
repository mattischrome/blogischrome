summary: "What I did when I wanted to make the Hugo branch of this branch main, without using a merge."
---

I wanted to make my main branch an archive branch and make my Hugo branch the new branch. I wanted to do this without having to merge everything if possible.

Here's a diagram I drew on a post-it note:

![]()

To to do this I issued the following commands:

```shell
git blah blah blah
```

Why did I want to do this? It seems like git commits only count on GitHub if they are to master or main. I need my green blobs thank you very much!
